share data)
PART I
Item 1. Business
The Company
Griffon
Corporation (the Company or Griffon), is a diversified management and
holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among
them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and
assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth
opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. Griffon, to further
diversify, also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire
additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.
Headquartered
in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is incorporated in
Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the
symbol GFF.
Griffon
currently conducts its operations through three businesses: Telephonics
Corporation (Telephonics), Home & Building Products (HBP) and Clopay
Plastic Products Company (Plastics). 



 


 


 


 




 





HBP,
which consists of two companies, Ames True Temper, Inc (ATT) and Clopay
Building Products (CBP), accounted for 46% of Griffons consolidated
revenue in 2012, 46% in 2011, and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
acquisition of ATT as if it had occurred on October 1, 2009, 48% of Griffons
consolidated revenue in 2010:




 


 


 


 




 


 


-


ATT,
acquired on September 30, 2010, is a global provider of non-powered
landscaping products that make work easier for homeowners and professionals.
Due to the timing of the acquisition, none of ATTs 2010 and prior results of
operations were included in Griffons results. ATTs revenue was 23% of
Griffons consolidated revenue in 2012 and 24% in 2011. 2010 pro forma
revenue was $443,634, or 26% of Griffons pro forma 2010 revenue of
$1,737,630 (unaudited), giving effect to the acquisition of ATT as if it had
occurred on October 1, 2009.




 


 


 


 




 


 


-


CBP
is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential, commercial and
industrial garage doors to professional installing dealers and major home
center retail chains. CBPs revenue was 23% of Griffons consolidated revenue
in 2012, 22% in 2011 and 30% in 2010. 




 


 


 


 




 





Telephonics
designs, develops and manufactures high-technology integrated information,
communication and sensor system solutions for military and commercial markets
worldwide. Telephonics revenue was 24% of Griffons consolidated revenue in
2012, 25% in 2011 and 34% in 2010. 




 


 


 


 




 





Plastics
is an international leader in the development and production of embossed,
laminated and printed specialty plastic films used in a variety of hygienic,
health-care and industrial applications. Plastics revenue was 30% of
Griffons consolidated revenue in 2012, 29% in 2011 and 36% in 2010. 



On
October 17, 2011, Griffon acquired the pots and planters business of Southern
Sales & Marketing Group, Inc. (Southern Patio) for approximately $23,000.
The acquired business, which markets its products under the Southern PatioTM
brand name, is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of landscape
accessories. Southern Patio, which has been integrated with ATT, had revenue
exceeding $40,000 in 2011.
2


On
March 17, 2011, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under
Rule 144A, Griffon issued, at par, $550,000 of 7.125% Senior Notes due in 2018
(Senior Notes); interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually.
Proceeds were used to pay down the outstanding borrowings under a senior
secured term loan facility and two senior secured revolving credit facilities
of certain Company subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and are
subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. On August 9, 2011,
Griffon exchanged all of the Senior Notes for substantially identical Senior Notes
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, via an exchange offer.
On
March 18, 2011, Griffon entered into a five-year $200,000 Revolving Credit
Facility (Credit Agreement), which includes a letter of credit sub-facility
with a limit of $50,000, a multi-currency sub-facility of $50,000 and a swing
line sub-facility with a limit of $30,000. Interest is payable on borrowings at
either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate plus an applicable margin, which
adjusts based on financial performance. The current margins are 1.5% for base
rate loans and 2.5% for LIBOR loans, in each case without a floor. Borrowings
under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries and
are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all assets of the
Company and the guarantors. At September 30, 2012, there were $21,693 of
standby letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement; $178,307 was
available for borrowing at that date.
On
September 30, 2010, Griffon purchased all of the outstanding stock of CHATT
Holdings, Inc. (ATT Holdings), the parent of ATT, on a cash and debt-free
basis, for $542,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments. As the purchase of
ATT occurred on September 30, 2010, ATTs operating results are not included in
Griffons consolidated statements of operations or cash flows, or footnotes
relating thereto for any year presented prior to October 1, 2010, except where
explicitly stated as pro-forma results. All pro forma results are unaudited
and, unless otherwise stated, give effect to the acquisition of ATT as if it
had occurred on October 1, 2009. The Griffon consolidated balance sheet at
September 30, 2010, and related notes thereto, include ATTs balances at that
date. 
In
July 2010, Griffon retired substantially all of its outstanding 4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2023 when these notes were put to Griffon at par.
In
December 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal amount of 4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) at an initial conversion ratio
of 67.0799 shares of Griffon common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the
2017 Notes, corresponding to an initial conversion price of approximately
$14.91 per share.
In
2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon
exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services
segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers,
fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building
products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven
units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of
substantially all this segment has been reported as discontinued operations in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented; the
Installation Services segment is excluded from segment reporting.

Reportable Segments:
Home & Building Products
Home &
Building Products consists of two companies, Ames True Temper, Inc and Clopay
Building Products, which are described below.  
Ames True Temper 
ATT
is the leading U.S. and a global provider of non-powered landscaping products
that make work easier for homeowners and professionals. ATT employs approximately
1,400 employees. 
Brands
ATT
brands are among the most recognized across primary product categories in the
North American, non-powered landscaping product markets. ATTs brand portfolio
includes Ames®, True Temper®, Ames True Temper®, Garant®, Hound Dog®, Westmix,
Dynamic Design® and Southern Patio, as well as contractor-oriented brands
including UnionTools®, Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional
Tools. This strong portfolio of brands enables ATT to build and maintain
long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In
addition, given the breadth of ATTs brand portfolio and product category
depth, ATT is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for
key retail customers. In addition to the brands listed, ATT also sells private
label branded products further enabling channel management and customer
differentiation. 
Products
ATT
manufactures and markets one of the broadest product portfolios in the
non-powered landscaping product industry. This portfolio is anchored by three
core product categories: long handle tools, wheelbarrows, and snow tools. As a
result of ATTs brand portfolio recognition, high product quality, industry
leading service and strong customer relationships, ATT has earned market-leading
positions in the long handle tool, wheelbarrow, and snow tool product
categories. The following is a brief description of ATTs primary product
lines:



 


 







Long
Handle Tools: An
extensive line of engineered tools including shovels, spades, scoops, rakes,
hoes, cultivators, weeders, post hole diggers, scrapers, edgers and forks,
marketed under leading brand names including Ames®, True Temper®, Jackson®
Professional Tools, UnionTools®, Razor-Back® Professional Tools, and Garant®.





 


 







Wheelbarrows:
ATT designs,
develops and manufactures a full line of wheelbarrows and lawn carts,
primarily under the Ames®, True Temper®, Jackson® Professional Tools,
Razor-Back® Professional Tools, UnionTools®, Garant® and Westmix brand
names. The products range in size (2 cubic feet to 10 cubic feet), material
(poly and steel), tray form, tire type, handle length and color based on the
needs of homeowners, landscapers and contractors. 



4






 


 







Snow Tools: A complete line of snow tools is marketed under the Ames True
Temper®, True Temper® and Garant® brand names. The snow tool line includes
shovels, pushers, roof rakes, sled sleigh shovels, scoops and ice scrapers. 




 


 







Planters and Lawn Accessories: ATT is a designer, manufacturer and
distributor of indoor and outdoor planters and accessories, sold under the
Dynamic Design® and Southern Patio brand names, as well as various private
label brands. The range of planter sizes (from 6 to 32 inches) are available
in various designs, colors and materials. On October 17, 2011, Griffon acquired the pots and planters
business which markets its products under the Southern Patio brand name.
Southern Patio is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of decorative
landscape products. Southern Patio and Dynamic Design® have been integrated
to leverage Southern Patios capabilities, enhances ATTs product offering in
the pots and planters category and enables ATT to improve its innovation and
speed to market in the category.




 


 







Striking Tools: Axes, picks, mattocks, mauls, wood splitters, sledgehammers and
repair handles make up the striking tools product line. These products are
marketed under the True Temper®, Jackson® Professional Tools, UnionTools®,
Garant® and Razor-Back® Professional Tools brand names. 




 


 







Pruning: The pruning line is made up of pruners, loppers, shears and other tools
sold primarily under the True Temper® brand name.




 


 







Garden Hose and Storage: ATT offers a wide range of both
manufactured and sourced garden hoses and hose reels under the Ames®,
NeverLeak® and Jackson® Professional Tools brand names. 



Customers
ATT sells
products throughout North
America, Australia, and Europe through (1) retail centers, including home
centers and mass merchandisers, such as The Home Depot (Home Depot), Lowes
Companies (Lowes), Walmart, Canadian Tire, Costco, Rona, Bunnings, and
Woodies (2) wholesale chains, including hardware stores and garden centers,
such as Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value and (3) industrial distributors, such as
Grainger and ORS Nasco. 
Home
Depot and Lowes are significant customers of ATT. The loss of either of these
customers would have a material effect on ATTs and Griffons business.
Product Development
ATT
product development efforts focus on both new products and product line
extensions. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and
engineering staffs, and through relationships with a number of outside product
engineering and design firms, to introduce new products timely and cost
effectively. Examples of recent new product initiatives include the SnoForce
combo snow shovel, NeverLeak® hose reel with patent pending aluminum water
system, Total Control Wheelbarrow with patented handle system, and new
Stonecraft fiber clay planters providing a heavier, more durable ceramic-like
pot. 
Sales and Marketing
ATTs
sales organization is structured by distribution channel in the U.S. and by
country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals
is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained
adjacent to each of the three largest customers headquarters, as well as
dedicated in-house sales analysts at the corporate office. In addition, sales
professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale
and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia,
Mexico and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective locations.
5


Raw Materials and Suppliers
ATTs
primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high
density polyethylene), wood (mainly ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel
(hot rolled and cold rolled). In addition, some key materials and components
are purchased, such as metal fork components, wheelbarrow tires, shovel heads
and fiberglass handles; most final assembly is completed internally in order to
ensure consistent quality. All raw materials used by ATT are generally
available from a number of sources.
Competition
The
non-powered landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented.
Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a
single product category. Some competitors such as Fiskars Corporation and
Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.U. compete in various tool categories, Suncast
Corporation in hose reels and accessories, and Colorite Waterworks and Swan,
both Techniplex companies, in garden hoses. In addition, there is competition
from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost
producing countries, particularly in long handled tools, wheelbarrows,
planters, striking tools and pruning tools. 
The
principal factors by which ATT differentiates itself and provides the best
value to customers are innovation, service, quality, performance and
reliability with strong brand heritage. ATTs size, depth and breadth of
product offering, category knowledge, research and development (R&D)
investment and service are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack
sufficient product innovation, capacity, lead time and distribution
capabilities to service large retailers to compete in highly seasonal, weather
related product categories. 
Manufacturing & Distribution
ATT
has nine operational distribution centers. In the U.S., the largest of these is
a 1.2 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and a 400,000
square foot facility in Reno, Nevada. Finished goods from manufacturing sites
are transported to these facilities by an internal fleet, over the road
trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle,
Pennsylvania and Reno, Nevada locations. Distribution centers are maintained in
Canada and Ireland, and ATT utilizes a third party distribution center in
Mexico City, Mexico. ATT has five distribution centers in Australia. ATT has a
combination of internal and external, domestic and foreign manufacturing
sources from which it produces products for sale in North American, Australian
and European markets.
Clopay Building Products
CBP
is the largest manufacturer and marketer of residential garage doors, among the
largest manufacturers of commercial sectional doors in the United States and
manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to
complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of CBPs
sales are for home remodeling and renovation, with the balance for the new
residential housing and commercial building markets. Sales into the home
remodeling market are being driven by the continued aging of the housing stock,
existing home sales activity, the trend of improving home appearance, as well
as improved energy efficiency. CBP employs approximately 1,300 employees.
6


According
to the US census, calendar year 2012 new construction single-family homes
starts will increase by 43%. The repair and remodel market increased 4% from
calendar year 2011 spending levels. The commercial segment saw spending drop 6%
for the year (according to estimates from McGraw Hill  Construction
Dodge). According to industry sources, the residential and commercial sectional
garage door market for calendar year 2011 was estimated to be $1,600,000, which
increased $100,000 over the prior year.
Brands
CBP brings nearly
50 years of experience and innovation to the garage door industry. Our strong
family of brands includes Clopay®, Americas Favorite Garage Doors®; Holmes
Garage Door Company® and IDEAL Door®. Clopay is the only residential garage
door brand to hold the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.
Products
and Service
CBP
manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety
of options, at varying prices. CBP offers garage doors made primarily from
steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as
garage door openers, manufactured by third parties.
CBP
also markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential
garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance
specifications of a commercial application.
CBP has a
complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular
residential garage door styles. 
Customers
CBP
is the principal supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America
to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a
material adverse effect on CBPs and Griffons business. CBP distributes its
garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and
through its distribution centers located throughout the United States and
Canada. These distribution centers allow CBP to maintain an inventory of garage
doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and
professional dealer customers.
Product Development
CBP product development efforts focus on both new
products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through
in-house design and engineering staffs. 
CBP
operates a technical development center where its research engineers design,
develop and implement new products and technologies and perform durability and
performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. CBP
continually improves their garage door offerings through these development
efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design and energy
efficiency. Also at this facility, the process engineering team works to
develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at
improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products.
Sales and Marketing
The
CBP sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new
product development and aggressively markets garage door solutions, with a
primary focus on the North American market. 
7


Raw Materials and Suppliers
The
principal raw material used in CBPs manufacturing is galvanized steel. CBP
also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam.
All of these raw materials are generally available from a number of sources.
Competition
The
garage door industry is characterized by several large national manufacturers
and many smaller regional and local manufacturers. CBP competes on the basis of
service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design.
CBPs
brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. CBP
believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers, retailers
and wholesalers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors.
CBPs market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for
expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing
its market share.
Distribution
CBP
distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels,
including installing dealers, retailers and wholesalers. CBP owns and operates
a national network of 49 distribution centers. Additionally, products are sold
to approximately 2,000 independent professional installing dealers and to major
home center retail chains. CBP maintains strong relationships with its
installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of residential
garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North
America.
Manufacturing
CBP currently has
manufacturing facilities, in Troy, Ohio, Russia, Ohio, and Auburn, Washington.
During
the first quarter of 2013, CBP announced the closing of the Auburn, Washington
facility and the consolidation of that facility into its Russia, Ohio facility.
The consolidation of these facilities is expected to be completed in the second
quarter of 2013.
In
June 2009, CBP undertook to consolidate its manufacturing facilities. These
actions were completed in 2011. CBP incurred total pre-tax exit and
restructuring costs approximating $9,031, substantially all of which was cash
charges; charges include $1,160 for one-time termination benefits and other
personnel costs, $210 for excess facilities and related costs, and $7,661 for
other exit costs, primarily in connection with production realignment, and had
$10,365 of capital expenditures. 
The
facility consolidation was part of CBPs continuing efforts to improve and
streamline its manufacturing processes. CBPs engineering and technological
expertise, combined with its capital investment programs, has enabled it to
efficiently manufacture products in large volume and meet changing customer
needs in a timely manner. CBP uses proprietary manufacturing processes to
produce the majority of its products. Certain machinery and equipment are
internally modified to achieve manufacturing objectives. These manufacturing
facilities produce a broad line of high quality garage doors for distribution
to professional installer, retail and wholesale channels.

Telephonics Corporation
Telephonics
specializes in advanced electronic information and communication systems for
defense, aerospace, civil, industrial, and commercial applications for the
United States (U.S.) and international markets. Telephonics designs,
develops, manufactures, sells, and provides logistical support for aircraft intercommunication
systems, radar, air traffic management, identification friend or foe equipment,
Integrated Homeland Security Systems and custom, mixed-signal,
application-specific, integrated circuits. Telephonics is also a provider of
advanced systems engineering services supporting air and missile defense
programs, as well as other threat and situational analysis requirements.
Telephonics is a leading supplier of airborne maritime surveillance radar and
aircraft intercommunication management systems, the segments two largest
product lines. In addition to its traditional defense products used
predominantly by the U.S. Government and its agencies, Telephonics has adapted
its core technologies to products used in international markets in an effort to
further increase its presence in both non-defense government and commercial
markets. In 2012, approximately 79% of the segments sales were to the U.S.
Government and agencies thereof, as a prime or subcontractor, 11% to
international customers and 10% to U.S. commercial customers. Telephonics
employs approximately 1,100 employees.
Griffon
believes that Telephonics advanced systems and sub-systems are well-positioned
to address the needs of an electronic battlefield with emphasis on providing
situational awareness to the warfighters through the retrieval and
dissemination of timely data for use by highly mobile ground, air and sea-going
forces. Telephonics anticipates that the need for such systems will increase in
connection with the increasingly active role that the military is playing in
the war on terrorism, both at home and abroad. In recent years, Telephonics has
increasingly focused its technologies and core competencies in the growing
Homeland Security, Air Traffic Management, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
markets.
On
August 1, 2012, Telephonics signed a definitive agreement to form a Joint
Venture (JV) with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., one of Indias leading
business houses, to provide the Indian Ministry of Defense and the Indian Civil
sector with radar and surveillance systems, Identification Friend or Foe
(IFF) devices and communication systems. In addition, the JV intends to
provide systems for Air Traffic Management Services, Homeland Security and
other emerging surveillance requirements.
Programs and Products
Based
on long-established relationships supported by existing contractual
arrangements, Telephonics is a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the
defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General
Dynamics, MacDonald Dettwiler, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Sikorsky Aircraft,
and is at times a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense and the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (Homeland Security). The significance of
each of these customers to Telephonics revenue fluctuates on an annual basis,
based on the timing and funding of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM)
contract award, and the technological scope of the work required to be
performed. The significant contraction and consolidation in the U.S. and
international defense industry provides opportunities for established
first-tier suppliers to capitalize on existing relationships with major prime
contractors and play a larger role in defense systems development and
procurement, for the foreseeable future.
Telephonics
continues to direct resources towards Homeland Security programs. Previously,
Telephonics has completed a contract from the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection for mobile surveillance systems as part of Homeland Securitys
initiative to protect the U.S. borders, and in 2011 was awarded another
contract to provide additional mobile surveillance systems. These programs
represent strategic advances for Telephonics by enabling it to expand its core
technical expertise into the nascent and growing Homeland Security market. As with many
Department of Homeland Security programs, the system specifications, and
operational and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by demanding
delivery schedules. 
In
2010, Telephonics was selected by Northrop Grumman as the radar supplier for
the U.S. Navys Firescout MQ-8 program, which is a vertical take-off and
landing UAV platform. This positions Telephonics, with both its radar and
communications products, as a strong competitor in this growing market
segment. Telephonics expects to start recognizing revenue for this project in
2013 and begin shipping in 2014.

As
a result of its performance on a prior manufacturing contract with Syracuse
Research Corporation, Telephonics received a subcontract award from Sierra
Nevada Corporation for both production and support of counter-IED devices which
resulted in $24,000, $44,000 and $46,000 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Backlog
The
funded backlog for Telephonics approximated $451,000 at September 30, 2012,
compared to $417,000 at September 30, 2011. The increase in backlog is
primarily attributable to additional funding received for the MH-60R program, a
unique, fully integrated multi-mode radar and identification friend or foe
interrogator system. Approximately 70% of the current backlog is expected to be
filled during 2013. 
Customers
The
U.S. Government, through its agencies, Lockheed Martin Corporation and the
Boeing Company are significant customers of Telephonics. The loss of any one of
these customers would have a material adverse effect on Telephonics business.
Notwithstanding the significance of Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Boeing
Company, Telephonics sells to a diverse group of other domestic and
international defense industry contractors, as well as others who use
Telephonics products for commercial use.
Telephonics
participates in a range of long-term defense and non-military government
programs, both in the U.S. and internationally. Telephonics has developed a
base of installed products that generate significant recurring revenue from
product enhancements and retrofits as well as providing spare parts and
customer support. Due to the inherent complexity of these electronic systems,
Telephonics believes that its incumbent status on major platforms provides a
competitive advantage in the selection process for platform upgrades and
enhancements. Furthermore, Telephonics believes that its ability to leverage
and apply its advanced technology to new platforms provides a competitive
advantage when bidding for new business.
Research
and Development 
In
an effort to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty, Telephonics works
closely with prime customers to ensure that there is a future market for its
products by investing R&D funds in desired enhancements. Telephonics
continually updates its core technologies through internally funded R&D
while coordinating with its customers at the earliest stages of new program
development in an effort to provide solutions well in advance of its
competitors. Telephonics is a technological leader in its core markets and
pursues new growth opportunities by leveraging its systems design and
engineering capabilities and incumbent position on key platforms. 
In
addition to products for defense programs, Telephonics technology is also used
in commercial applications such as airborne weather, search and rescue radar,
and air traffic management systems. Telephonics reputation for innovative
product design and engineering capabilities, especially in the areas of voice
and data communications, radio frequency design, digital signal processing,
networking systems, inverse synthetic aperture radar and analog, digital and
mixed-signal integrated circuits, will continue to enhance its ability to
secure, retain and expand its participation in defense programs and commercial
opportunities.
Telephonics
often designs its products to exceed customers minimum specifications,
providing its customers with greater performance, flexibility, and value.
Telephonics believes that early participation and
communication with its customers in the requirements definition stages of new
program development increases the likelihood that its products will be selected
and integrated as part of a total system solution.
10


Sales and Marketing
Telephonics
has technical business development personnel who act as the focal point for its
marketing activities and sales representatives who introduce its products and
systems to customers worldwide.
Competition
Telephonics
competes with major manufacturers of electronic information and communication
systems, as well as several smaller manufacturers of similar products.
Telephonics endeavors to design products with greater performance and
flexibility than its competitors while competing on the basis of technology,
design, quality and price.
Manufacturing Facilities
Telephonics
facilities are principally located in the United States, primarily in New York,
with one facility in Sweden. Telephonics also maintains a Technical Support
Services Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina which supports aircraft
integration and upgrade activities, in addition to providing support services
to customers.  
Clopay Plastic Products
Plastics
produces and develops specialty plastic films and laminates for a variety of
hygienic, health care and industrial uses in the United States and certain
international markets. Products include thin gauge embossed and printed films,
elastomeric films, laminates of film and non-woven fabrics, and perforated
films and non-wovens. These products are used as moisture barriers in
disposable infant diapers, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene
products, protective barriers in single-use surgical and industrial gowns,
drapes and equipment covers, fluid transfer/distribution layers in absorbent
products, components to enhance comfort and fit in infant diaper and adult
incontinence products, packaging for hygienic products, house wrap and other
products. Plastics products are sold through a direct sales force, primarily
to multinational consumer and medical products companies. Plastics employs
approximately 1,500 employees.
The
markets in which Plastics participates have been affected by several key trends
over the past five years. These trends include the increased use of disposable
products in developing countries and favorable demographics, including
increasing immigration in major global economies. Other trends representing
significant opportunities include the continued demand for innovative products
such as cloth-like, breathable, laminated and printed products, and large
consumer products companies need for global supply partners. Notwithstanding
the positive trends affecting the industry, product design changes by the
customer can change the products manufactured by Plastics and the associated
demand.
Plastics
believes that its business development activities targeting major multinational
and regional producers of hygiene, healthcare and related products and its
investments in its technology development capability and capacity increases will
lead to additional sales of new and related products.
Products
Plastics
specialty plastic film is a thin-gauge film engineered to provide certain
performance characteristics and manufactured from polymer resins. A laminate
11


 is
the combination of a plastic film and a woven or non-woven fabric. These
products are produced using both cast and blown extrusion and various
laminating processes. High speed, multi-color custom printing of films,
customized embossing patterns,
and proprietary perforation technology further differentiate the products.
Specialty plastic film products typically provide a unique combination of
performance characteristics, such as breathability, barrier properties, fluid
flow management, elastic properties, process ability and aesthetic appeal, that
meet specific, proprietary customer needs.
Customers
Plastics
largest customer is Procter & Gamble, Co. (P&G), which has accounted
for approximately half of its revenue over the last five years. The loss of
this customer would have a material adverse effect on the Plastics business and
Griffon. Notwithstanding the significance of P&G, Plastics sells to a
diverse group of other leading consumer, health care and industrial companies.
Product Development
Plastics
is an industry leader in the research, design and development of specialty
plastic film and laminate products. Plastics operates a technical center where
polymer chemists, scientists and engineers work independently and in
partnerships with customers to develop new technologies, products, processes
and product applications.
Plastics
R&D efforts have resulted in many inventions covering embossing patterns,
improved processing methods, product formulations, product applications and
other proprietary technology. Products developed include microporous breathable
films and cost-effective printed films and laminates. Microporous breathability
provides for moisture vapor transmission and airflow while maintaining barrier
properties resulting in improved comfort and skin care. Elastic laminates
provide the user with improved comfort and fit. Printed films and laminates
provide consumers preferred aesthetics, such as softness and visual appeal.
Perforated films and non-wovens provide engineered fluid transfer with unique
softness and aesthetics. Plastics holds a number of patents for its specialty
film and laminate products and related manufacturing processes. While patents
play a significant role, Plastics believes that its proprietary know-how and
the knowledge, ability and experience of its employees are more significant to
its long-term success.
Sales and Marketing
Plastics
sells its products primarily in North America, Europe, and South and Central
America with additional sales in Asia Pacific. Plastics utilizes an internal
direct sales force, with senior management actively participating in developing
and maintaining close contacts with customers.
Plastics
seeks to expand its market presence by providing innovative products and
services to major international consumer products companies. Specifically,
Plastics believes that it can continue to increase its North American sales and
expand internationally through ongoing product development and enhancement, and
by marketing its technologically-advanced films, laminates and printed films for
use in all of its markets. Operations in Germany, Brazil and most recently
China and Turkey, provide a strong platform for additional sales growth in
international markets.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Plastic
resins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and non-woven fabrics are the
basic raw materials used in the manufacture of substantially all Plastics
products. The price of resin has fluctuated dramatically over the past five
years primarily due to volatility in oil prices and producer capacity. Resins
are purchased in pellet form from several suppliers. Sources for raw materials
are believed to be adequate for current and anticipated needs.
12


Competition
Plastics
has a number of competitors, some of which are larger, in the specialty plastic
films and laminates market. Plastics competes on quality, service and price
using its technical expertise, product development capabilities and broad
international footprint to enhance its market position, build and maintain
long-term customer relationships and meet changing customer needs. 
Manufacturing
Specialty
plastic film and laminate products are manufactured using high-speed equipment
designed to meet stringent tolerances. The manufacturing process consists of
melting a mixture of polymer resins and additives, and forcing this mixture
through a die and rollers to produce thin films. Laminates of films and
non-wovens are manufactured by a variety of techniques to meet customer needs.
In addition, films and laminates can be printed.
Plastics
U.S. manufacturing facilities are in Augusta, Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee
from which it sells plastic films throughout the United States and various
parts of the world.
Plastics
has two manufacturing facilities in Germany from which it sells plastic films
throughout Europe and the Middle East. Plastics also has operations in Brazil,
China and Turkey, which manufacture plastic hygienic and specialty films.
Plastics international operations provide a platform to broaden participation
in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia and strengthen Plastics
position as a global supplier.
Griffon Corporation
Employees
Griffon
and its subsidiaries employ approximately 5,400 people located primarily
throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, Brazil, Australia, China and Mexico.
Approximately 440 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements in the U.S., primarily with an affiliate of the American Federation
of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBCJA), International
Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry,
Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy Allied Industrial and Service Workers
International Union. Additionally, approximately 169 employees in Canada are
represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its
relationships with its employees are satisfactory.
Regulation
Griffons
operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety
laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with
these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental laws
has not materially affected, and is not expected to materially affect,
Griffons capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the future.
Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur
additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.
Telephonics,
which sells directly and indirectly to the U.S. government, is subject to
certain regulations, laws and standards set by the U.S. government.
Additionally, Telephonics is subject to routine audits and investigations by
U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other
Inspectors General. These agencies review a contractors performance under its
contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
standards. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractors
compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors
management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and
information systems.
13


Customers
A
small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account
for, a substantial portion of Griffons consolidated revenue. For 2012:



 


 


 




 


a.


The U.S. Government and
its agencies, through either prime or subcontractor relationships,
represented 19% of Griffons consolidated revenue and 79% of Telephonics
revenue.




 


b.


P&G represented 13% of
Griffons consolidated revenue and 43% of Plastics revenue.




 


c.


Home Depot represented 12%
of Griffons consolidated revenue and 25% of HBP revenue. 



No other customers exceeded 9% of consolidated
revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the
success of Griffons largest customers and Griffons relationships with them.
Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced
materially. The loss of all or a
portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse
impact on Griffons liquidity and operations.
Seasonality
Generally,
Griffons revenue and income are lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending
December 31 and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third
quarters ending March 31 and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the
seasonality of ATTs business. ATTs lawn and garden products are used
primarily in the spring and summer; in 2012, 61% of ATTs sales occurred during
the second and third quarters. CBPs business is driven by residential
renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced
levels during the winter months. 
Demand
for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend
weather during the peak gardening season. ATTs sales volumes could be
adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or
warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of
snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may also result in
reduced sales of certain ATT products, such as snow shovels and other snow
tools. As a result, ATTs results of operations, financial results and cash
flows could be adversely impacted.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
Segment
and operating results are included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For
geographic financial information, see the Business Segment footnote in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.
Griffons non-U.S. businesses are primarily in
Germany, Canada, Brazil, Turkey, China, Australia, Sweden and Mexico. 
Research and Development
Griffons
companies are encouraged to improve existing products as well as develop new
products to satisfy customer needs; expand revenue opportunities; maintain or
extend competitive advantages; increase market share and reduce production
costs. R&D costs, not recoverable under contractual arrangements, are
charged to expense as incurred. R&D costs for Griffon were $23,600 in 2012,
$23,900 in 2011 and $21,400 in 2010. 
14


Intellectual
Property
Griffon follows a practice of actively
protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the
world where Griffons products are sold.
Trademarks are of significant importance to
Griffons HBP business. Principal global and regional trademarks include
Clopay®, Ideal Door®, Holmes®, Ames®, True Temper®, Ames True Temper®, Garant®,
Hound Dog®, Westmix and Dynamic Design, UnionTools®, Razor-Back® Professional
Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. Plastics uses the Clopay® trademark
in addition to its 7 other trademarks. The HBP business has 482 trademarks and
approximately 75 pending trademark applications. Griffons rights in these
trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered.
Patents are significant to Plastics.
Technology evolves rapidly in the plastics business, and Plastics customers
are constantly striving to offer products with innovative features at a
competitive price to the end consumer. As a result, Plastics is constantly
seeking to offer new and innovative products to its customers. Plastics has 26
patents in the U.S., and 164 corresponding foreign patents, primarily covering
breathable and elastic polymer films and laminates and various methods and
machinery for producing these materials. Patents are also important to our HBP
segment. ATT protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents,
and currently has 228 issued patents and 41 pending patent applications in the
United States, as well as 81 and 49 corresponding foreign patents and patent
applications, respectively. CBP has 25 patents in the United States, and 32
corresponding foreign patents, primarily related to garage door system
components. Design patents are generally valid for fourteen years, and utility
patents are generally valid for twenty years. Our various patents are in
different stages of their useful life.
In the government and defense
business, formal intellectual property rights are of limited value. Therefore,
our Telephonics business tends to hold most of its important intellectual
property as trade secrets, which it protects through the use of contract terms
and carefully restricting access to its technology.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Griffons business, financial condition, operating results and cash
flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffons actual
results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk
factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of
the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should
not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may
also materially impact Griffons business, financial condition, operating
results and cash flows in the future.
In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and
uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but
not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth
rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets;
continued events in the Middle East and possible future terrorist threats and
their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules.
Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it
believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial
condition.
Current worldwide economic uncertainty and
market volatility could adversely affect Griffons businesses. 
The current worldwide economic uncertainty, market volatility and
credit crisis will continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2013,
particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing market
and the U.S. economy, in general. Also, purchases of ATT products are
discretionary for consumers and consumers are generally more willing to
purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions
prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact
Griffons ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit for
investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or
there may be no financing available. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic
risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services offered
or a higher risk of default on its receivables. 
Adverse trends in the housing sector and in
general economic conditions will directly impact Griffons business.
HBPs business is influenced by market conditions for new home
construction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30,
2012, approximately 46% of Griffons consolidated revenue was derived from the
HBP segment, which is heavily dependent on new home construction and renovation
of existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home
stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of
consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as the migration into the
United States and migration of the population within the United States also
have an effect on HBP. In that respect, the significant downturn in the housing
market has had an adverse effect on the operating results of HBP and this
effect is likely to continue in 2013, particularly to its CBP business.
Griffon operates in highly competitive
industries and may be unable to compete effectively.
Griffons operating companies face intense competition in each of the
markets served. There are a number of competitors, some of which are larger and
have greater resources than Griffons operating companies. Griffon competes
primarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, product
differentiation, and quality of products and services. There can be no
assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future,
which could have a material adverse effect on Griffons financial results.
17


The loss of large customers can harm financial results.
A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue
to account for, a substantial portion of consolidated revenue. Approximately
13% of consolidated revenue and 43% of the Plastics segment revenue for the
year ended September 30, 2012 was generated from P&G, the largest customer
in the Plastics segment. Home Depot, Lowes and Menards are significant
customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 12% of
consolidated revenue and 25% of the HBP segment revenue for the year ended
September 30, 2012. The U.S. Government and its agencies, Lockheed Martin
Corporation and the Boeing Company, are significant customers of Telephonics.
Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success
of Griffons largest customers, as well as Griffons relationship with them.
Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced
materially due to changes in these customers needs. Any reduction or delay in
sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce
Griffons revenue. Griffons operating results will also depend on successfully
developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure
that Griffons largest customers will be retained or that additional key
customers will be recruited. Also, HBP extends credit to its customers, which
exposes it to credit risk. Their largest customer accounted for approximately
22% and 9% of HBPs and Griffons net accounts receivable as of September 30,
2012, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise
unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows of the HBP segment would be adversely affected.
Reliance on third
party suppliers and manufacturers may impair ability to meet ATTs customer
demands.
ATT relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to
supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of
ATTs products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 34% in 2012. Reliance on
third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of
deliveries and quality of ATTs products. Reduced product quality or failure to
deliver products quickly may jeopardize relationships with certain of ATTs key
customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may
result in failure to meet ATTs customer demands. Continued turbulence in the
worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of ATTs
suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply,
go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers
may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact ATTs
ability to fill orders, which would have a material adverse effect on customer
relationships.
If Griffon is unable
to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely
impact operating performance.
HBPs and Plastics suppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel.
Assurance cannot be provided that these segments may not experience shortages
of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative
sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused
by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw
materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms
may not be as favorable as current terms or material may not be available at
all. In recent years, HBP and Plastics have experienced price increases in
steel and plastic resins.
While most key raw materials used in Griffons businesses are generally
available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price
fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant
component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material
adverse effect on Griffons results of operations. Griffons ability to pass
raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements
and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between
increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price
increases for Griffons products. In particular, sharp increases in raw
material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may
negatively affect short-term financial performance.
18


ATT is subject to
risks associated with sourcing from Asia.
A substantial amount of ATTs finished goods sourcing is done through
supply agreements with China based vendors. China does not have a
well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with
international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on
existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain
swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a
court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary
in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any
litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be
subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Products
entering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and other
restrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and any
tariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a material
adverse result on ATTs business and results of operations, financial position
and cash flows.
Griffons businesses are subject to seasonal
variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns.
Generally, Griffons revenue and income are lowest in our first and
fourth quarters ending December 31 and September 30, respectively, and highest
in our second and third quarters ending March 31 and June 30, respectively,
primarily due to the seasonality of ATTs business. ATTs lawn and garden
products are used primarily in the spring and summer; in 2012 61% of ATTs
sales occurred during the second and third quarters. CBPs business is driven
by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is
generally at reduced levels during the winter months. 
Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather,
particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. ATTs sales
volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as
unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods.
In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter
season may also result in reduced sales of certain ATT products, such as snow
shovels and other snow tools. As a result, ATTs results of operations,
financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
Further
consolidation in the retail industry may adversely affect profitability.
Home centers and mass merchandisers have consolidated and increased in
scale. If this trend continues, customers will likely seek more favorable terms
for their purchases of products, which will limit Griffons ability to pass
through raw material or other cost increases, or to raise prices for any
reason. Sales on terms less favorable than current terms could have a material
adverse effect on profitability.
Unionized employees
could strike or participate in a work stoppage.
Griffon employs approximately 5,400 people on a full-time basis,
approximately 8% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor
agreements (all in the Telephonics and ATT businesses). If unionized employees
engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate
acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption
of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any
renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or
benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and
could have a material adverse effect on profitability.
19


Griffon may be
required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets.
Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in
circumstances or the  occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If
impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or
indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be
recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become
impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Trends in the baby diaper market will
directly impact Griffons business.
Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to specify
thinner plastic films for use in their products which reduces the amount of
product sold and Plastics revenue; this trend has generally resulted in
Plastics incurring costs to redesign and reengineer products to accommodate
required specification changes. Such decreases, or the inability to meet
changing customer specifications, could result in a material decline in
Plastics revenue and profits.
Telephonics business depends heavily upon
government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget.
Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both
directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the
defense industry such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky and Northrop
Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2012, U.S. government contracts and
subcontracts accounted for approximately 19% of Griffons consolidated revenue.
Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including:



 


 


 




 





Termination for convenience by the government;




 





Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the governments
 requirements or budgetary constraints;




 





Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits
 under contracts where Telephonics prices are fixed, or determinations that certain
 costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;




 





The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its
 contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor;




 





Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and
 procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred
 from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;




 





The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work
 provided for in contracts; and




 





The governments right, in certain circumstances, to freely use
 technology developed under these contracts.



All of Telephonics U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a
termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime
contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics,
upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered
items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for
profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing
agreements with suppliers.
The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several
years, but are normally funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S.
defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics
supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics
financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government
may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics development projects
apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete
successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding
on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect
the timing of revenue recognition, and impact the results of operation.
20


For 2013, the Budget Control Act calls for additional substantial,
mandatory defense spending reductions, known as sequestration, if Congress is
unable to  agree on a budget that conforms with the Budget Control Act
requirements. There continues to be much uncertainty regarding how
sequestration would be implemented, if it were to go into effect. There are many variables in
how the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specific
impacts; however, we expect that sequestration, as currently provided for under
the Budget Control Act, would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows
for Telephonics.
While members of Congress are discussing various
    options to prevent or defer sequestrations automatic spending cuts,
    we cannot predict whether these efforts will succeed. Budget decisions made
    in this environment could have long-term consequences for Telephonics and
    the entire defense industry. 
Telephonics business could be adversely affected by a negative audit
by the U.S. Government
As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government
contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S.
Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, other Inspectors
General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractors
performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable
laws, regulations and standards. These agencies also review the adequacy of,
and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies,
including the contractors management, purchasing, property, estimating,
compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be
misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be
reimbursed or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could
incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the
government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an
investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which
could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of
payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S.
Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics
and Griffon could suffer serious reputational harm.
Many of our
contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design
capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not
wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely
affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability.
Our Telephonics segment designs, develops and manufactures advanced and
innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of
applications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs,
system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are
challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays
in the development or delivery of such products could prevent us from meeting
contractual obligations, which could subject us to termination for
default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate
payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title
and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the
Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the
company for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment of
advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable
to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies
and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages.
Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse
effect on our financial position.
Griffons companies must continually improve
existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and
development in order to compete effectively.
The markets for Plastics and Telephonics are characterized by rapid technological
change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products.
Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on their
ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product
applications.
21


Product and technological developments are accomplished both through
internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships
with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of
time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives,
actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product
development schedules may be extended. Griffons financial condition and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if:



 


 


 




 





Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;




 





New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve
 sufficient market penetration;




 





There are budget overruns or delays in research and development
 efforts; or




 





New products experience reliability or quality problems.



Griffon may be unable to implement its
acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a
commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert managements attention.
Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffons growth
plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying
and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance
currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses.
Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to
maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense
and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition
candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely
manner or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be
properly integrated into Griffons existing structure. In implementing an
acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:



 


 


 




 





Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;




 





Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies
 into Griffons existing organization;




 





Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders; or




 





Diversion of managements attention.



An unsuccessful implementation of Griffons acquisition growth strategy
could have an adverse impact on Griffons results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition.
The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect
Griffons business. 
The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued
services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel
could have a material adverse effect on Griffons operating results or
financial condition.
Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks
relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and
political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.
Griffon and its companies own properties and conduct operations in
Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, China and Turkey. Sales of products
through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 25% of consolidated
revenue for the year ended September 30, 2012. These sales could be adversely
affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection
measures, differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory
requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Enforcement
of existing laws in foreign jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a
sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with
respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the
U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does
business may also have an impact on future reported financial results. 
22


Griffon may not be able to protect its
proprietary rights.
Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws,
trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other
contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not
provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for
protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that
competitors will not independently develop similar technologies.
Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing
on, proprietary rights held by another party.
Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing
technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure
it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may
inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary
rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety
rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such
infringement may have a material effect on Griffons financial statements and
financial condition.
Griffon is exposed to product liability
claims.
Griffon may be the subject of product liability claims relating to the
performance of its products or the performance of a product in which its
products were a component part. There can be no assurance that future product
liability claims will not be brought against Griffon, either by an injured
customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of the products as a
component or by a direct purchaser. Moreover, no assurance can be given that indemnification
from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover
future product liability claims against Griffon. In addition, product liability
insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in
the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage
may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted.
Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related
financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity.
Griffon has been, and may in the future be,
subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
Griffons operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and
regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the
handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or
otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in
various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any
expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these
environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on
its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable
requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time.
Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no
longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous
materials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures or
liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See the
Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on
facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffons results of operations
and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions,
changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may
give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities.
23


Changes in income tax laws and regulations or
exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect
profitability.
Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S.
and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and
liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and
international tax jurisdictions. Griffons effective tax rate could be
adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income
taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax
authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the
U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax
liabilities, Griffons future financial results may include unfavorable
adjustments to its income tax provision.
Compliance with restrictions and covenants in
Griffons debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions and
harm its business.
The senior secured credit agreement entered into by, and the terms of
the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the
ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur
additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit
agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios
and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants
or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing
economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon.
If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions
in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of
the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case
of the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit to
Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure
credit in the future, business could be harmed.
Reported earnings per share may be more
volatile because of the conversion contingency provision of the notes.
The outstanding convertible notes are convertible when a market price
condition is satisfied and also upon the occurrence of other circumstances as
more fully described in the Notes Payable, Capitalized Leases and Long-Term
Debt footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion,
at Griffons discretion, note holders will receive $1,000 in cash for each
$1,000 principal amount of notes presented for conversion or value in Griffons
common stock, and Griffon common stock for the value above the principal amount
of the notes. The potential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for value
above the principal value of the notes are considered in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share and volatility in Griffons stock price could cause
these notes to be dilutive in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter,
increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share.
Griffon may be unable to raise additional
financing if needed
Griffon may need to raise additional
financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance
debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required
additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable
terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional
funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may
experience significant ownership interest dilution and the new securities may
have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common
stock.
24


Griffons indebtedness and interest expense
could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffons ability to
make full payment on outstanding debt.
Griffons
indebtedness poses potential risks such as:



 


 


 




 





A
 substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay
 principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for
 working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and
 other general corporate purposes;




 





Insufficient
 cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek
 additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable
 terms, if at all; and




 





The level of
 indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry
 downturns.



Griffon has the ability to issue additional
equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding
common stock.
The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible
into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders equity
interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or
approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has
the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any
such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights,
conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,
liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of
Griffons common stock. There is no present intention of issuing any such
preferred stock, but Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. In
addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to
85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 60,888,522 shares, net of treasury shares,
were outstanding as of September 30, 2012. Additionally, Griffon is authorized
to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either
shares of common stock or preferred stock.

Griffon also leases approximately 1,050,000 square feet of space for
the CBP distribution centers in numerous facilities throughout the U.S. and in
Canada. In addition, Griffon owns
approximately 200,000 square feet of space for the ATT wood mills in the U.S. 
All facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted. 



 


 




Item 3.


Legal Proceedings 




Griffon is involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising
out of the normal conduct of business, including those relating to commercial
transactions, environmental, employment, and health and safety matters. Griffon estimates and accrues liabilities
resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors, including the stage of the proceeding; potential settlement
value; assessments by internal and external counsel; and assessments by
environmental engineers and consultants of potential environmental liabilities
and remediation costs. Such estimates
are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in
estimating the timing of the expenditures, which may extend over several years.
26


While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial
liability with respect to certain contingent liabilities and claims, Griffon
believes, based upon examination of currently available information, experience
to date, and advice from legal counsel, that the individual and aggregate
liabilities resulting from the ultimate resolution of these contingent matters,
after taking into consideration our existing insurance coverage and amounts
already provided for, will not have a material adverse impact on consolidated
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Item 7.


Managements Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



 (Unless otherwise
indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending
September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data) 
OVERVIEW
The Company 
Griffon Corporation (the Company or Griffon), is a diversified
management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the
operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages
their capital structures. Griffon
provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition
and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. Griffon, to further diversify, also seeks
out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that
offer potentially attractive returns on capital. 
Headquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is
incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
trades under the symbol GFF. 
Griffon currently conducts its operations through three businesses:
Telephonics Corporation (Telephonics), Home & Building Products (HBP)
and Clopay Plastic Products Company (Plastics). 



 


 


 


 




 


 


HBP, which consists of two companies, Ames True Temper, Inc (ATT)
 and Clopay Building Products (CBP), accounted for 46% of Griffons consolidated
 revenue in 2012, 46% in 2011, and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
 acquisition of ATT as if it had occurred on October 1, 2009, 48% of Griffons
 consolidated revenue in 2010: 




 


 


 


 




 


 


-


ATT, acquired on September 30, 2010, is a global provider of
 non-powered landscaping products that make work easier for homeowners and
 professionals. Due to the timing of
 the acquisition, none of ATTs 2010 and prior results of operations were
 included in Griffons results. ATTs
 revenue was 23% of Griffons consolidated revenue in 2012, and 24% in
 2011. ATT 2010 revenue was $443,634,
 or 26% of Griffons pro forma 2010 revenue of $1,737,630 (unaudited), giving
 effect to the acquisition of ATT as if it had occurred on October 1, 2009. 




 


 


 


 




 


 


-


CBP is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential, commercial
 and industrial garage doors to professional installing dealers and major home
 center retail chains. CBPs revenue was 23% of Griffons consolidated revenue
 in 2012, 22% in 2011 and 30% in 2010.




 


 


 




 





Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures high-technology
 integrated information, communication and sensor system solutions for
 military and commercial markets worldwide. Telephonics revenue was 24% of
 Griffons consolidated revenue in 2012, 25% in 2011 and 34% in 2010. 




 


 


 




 


 


Plastics is an international leader in the development and production
 of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films used in a variety
 of hygienic, health-care and industrial applications. Plastics revenue was 30% of Griffons
 consolidated revenue in 2012, 29% in 2011 and 36% in 2010. 



31


CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
2012 Compared to 2011 
Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2012 was $1,861,145, compared
to $1,830,802 in the prior year, with the increase driven by HBP and Plastics. Gross profit for 2012 was $418,805 compared
to $393,461 in 2011, with gross margin as a percent of sales (gross margin)
of 22.5% and 21.5%, respectively. Gross
profit for 2011 reflected $15,152 of costs of goods related to the sale of
inventory recorded at fair value in connection with the ATT acquisition
accounting; excluding this amount, 2011 gross profit was $408,613 with a gross
margin of 22.3%. 
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased
$11,327 to $341,696 in 2012 from $330,369 in 2011 in support of the increased
level of sales and due to the inclusion of Southern Patios expenses. SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue
for 2012 increased to 18.4% from 18.0% in 2011. 
Interest expense in 2012 totaled $52,007, an increase of $4,161
compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the increased debt
resulting from the 2011 refinancing of domestic subsidiary debt incurred as a
result of the ATT acquisition. 
During 2011, in connection with the termination of the Term Loan, ABL
and Telephonics credit agreement (TCA), Griffon recorded a $26,164 loss on
extinguishment of debt consisting of $21,617 of deferred financing charges and
original issuer discounts, a call premium of $3,703 on the Term Loan, and $844
of swap and other breakage costs. 
Other income of $1,236 in 2012 and $3,714 in 2011 consists primarily of
currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables
held in non functional currencies, and net gains on investments. 
Griffons effective tax rate for 2012 was 22.5% compared to a benefit
of 48.2% in 2011. The 2012 rate
reflected net discrete benefits of $5,110 primarily from the release of
previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions on conclusion of
various tax audits, and benefits related to various tax planning
initiatives. The 2011 rate reflected
net discrete benefits of $4,570 primarily from tax planning related to
unremitted foreign earnings. Excluding
discrete tax items, the 2012 rate would have been 45.8%, and the 2011 benefit
would have been 16.4%. In both years,
the effective rates reflect the impact of permanent differences not deductible
in determining taxable income, mainly limited deductibility of restricted
stock, as well as the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix
between domestic and non-domestic operations. 
Net Income was $17,011, or $0.30 per share, for 2012 compared to a loss
of $7,431 or $0.13 cents per share in the prior year. The current year results included the following: 



 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Restructuring charges of $4,689 ($3,048, net of tax, or $0.05 per
 share);




 


 


-


Acquisition and integration costs of $477 ($310, net of tax, or $0.01
 per share); and 




 


 


-


Discrete tax benefits, net, of $5,110, or $0.09 per share.



The prior year results included the following: 



 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Charges of $26,164 ($16,813, net of tax, or $0.29 per share)
 resulting from the refinancing of ATT acquisition related debt; 




 


 


-


$15,152 ($9,849, net of tax, or $0.17 per share) of increased cost of
 goods related to the sale of inventory recorded at fair value in connection
 with acquisition accounting for ATT;




 


 


-


Restructuring charges of $7,543 ($4,903, net of tax, or $0.08 per
 share);




 


 


-


Acquisition costs of $446 ($290, net of tax, or $0.00 per share); and



32






 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Discrete tax
 benefits, net, of $4,570, or $0.08 per share.



Excluding these items from both reporting periods, 2012 net income
would have been $15,259, or $0.27 per share compared to $19,854, or $0.34 per
share, in 2011. 
2011 Compared to 2010
Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $1,830,802, compared
to $1,293,996 in the prior year; the increase was due to the inclusion of ATTs
revenue as well as higher revenue at CBP, Telephonics and Plastics. On a pro forma basis, as if ATT was
purchased on October 1, 2009, 2011 consolidated revenue increased $93,172 in
comparison to 2010. Gross profit for
2011 was $393,461 compared to $288,304 in 2010, with gross margin of 21.5% and
22.3%, respectively. Gross profit for
2011 reflected $15,152 of costs of goods related to the sale of inventory
recorded at fair value in connection with the ATT acquisition accounting;
excluding this amount, 2011 gross profit was $408,613 with a gross margin of
22.3%. On a pro forma basis, as if ATT
was purchased on October 1, 2009, 2010 gross profit was $434,053 with a gross
margin of 25.0%. 
SG&A expenses increased $68,966 to $330,369 in 2011 from $261,403
in 2010 due to the inclusion of ATTs expenses, and in support of the increased
level of sales. In 2010, SG&A
expenses included $9,805 of costs related to the ATT acquisition; there were
$446 of such costs incurred in 2011.
SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue for 2011 decreased to 18.0%
from 20.2% in 2010; excluding the ATT related acquisition expenses, SG&A as
a percent of revenue was 19.4% in 2010.
On a pro forma basis, as if ATT was purchased on October 1, 2009,
SG&A expenses were $358,607 for 2010 and as a percent of pro forma revenue
for 2010 were 20.6%. The pro forma 2010
SG&A expenses included $21,075 of costs related to the sale of ATT to
Griffon and other costs relating to ATTs prior ownership, excluding these
costs, SG&A expenses were $337,532, or 19.4% of pro forma revenue. 
Interest expense in 2011 increased by $35,524 compared to the prior
year, primarily as a result of the debt incurred as a result of the ATT
acquisition. 
Other income of $3,714 in 2011 and $4,121 in 2010 consists primarily of
currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables
held in non functional currencies, and net gains on investments. 
Griffons effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2011 was a
benefit of 48.2% compared to a 31.2% provision in the prior year. The 2011 rate reflected net discrete
benefits of $4,570 primarily from tax planning related to unremitted foreign
earnings. The 2010 rate reflected net
discrete tax benefits of $2,307 primarily from the resolution of foreign and
domestic income tax audits. Excluding
the discrete tax items from both years, the 2011 tax benefit rate would have
been 16.4% and the 2010 tax provision rate would have been 47.9%. The 2011 rate reflects the impact of
permanent differences not deductible in determining taxable income, mainly
limited deductibility of restricted stock, as well as the impact of tax reserves
and changes in earnings mix between domestic and non-domestic
operations. The 2010 rate was impacted
by permanent book to tax adjustments including non-deductible transaction costs
of $3,800 related to the ATT acquisition.

Net loss was $7,431, or $0.13 per share, for 2011 compared to income of
$9,592 or $0.16 cents per share in the prior year. The 2011 results included the following: 



 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Charges of $26,164 ($16,813, net of tax, or $0.29 per share)
 resulting from the refinancing of ATT acquisition related debt; 




 


 


-


$15,152 ($9,849, net of tax, or $0.17 per share) of increased cost of
 goods related to the sale of inventory recorded at fair value in connection
 with acquisition accounting for ATT; 




 


 


-


Restructuring charges of $7,543 ($4,903, net of tax, or $0.08 per
 share);



33






 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Acquisition costs of $446 ($290, net of tax, or $0.00 per share); and
 




 


 


-


Discrete tax benefits, net, of $4,570, or $0.08 per share.




 


 


 


 




The 2010 results included the following:




 


 


 


 




 


 


-


ATT related acquisition costs of $9,805 ($7,704, net of tax, or $0.13
 per share); 




 


 


-


Restructuring charges of $4,180 ($2,717, net of tax, or $0.05 per
 share); 




 


 


-


Charges of $1,117 ($726, net of tax, or $0.01 per share) related to
 refinancing costs; and 




 


 


-


Discrete tax
 benefits, net, of $2,307, or $0.04 per share.



Excluding these items from both reporting periods, 2011 net income
would have been $19,854, or $0.34 per share compared to $18,432, or $0.31 per
share, in 2010. 
On a pro forma basis, as if ATT was purchased on October 1, 2009, Net
loss was $7,431, or $0.13 per share, in 2011 compared to income of $16,973 or
$0.28 cents per share in 2010. The pro
forma prior year results included the following: 



 


 


 


 




 


 


-


Acquisition and related costs of $21,075 ($13,699, net of tax, or
 $0.23 per share); 




 


 


-


Restructuring charges of $6,570 ($4,271, net of tax, or $0.07 per
 share); 




 


 


-


Charges of $1,117 ($726, net of tax, or $0.01 per share) related to
 refinancing costs; and 




 


 


-


Discrete tax benefits, net of $2,307, or $0.04 per share.



Excluding these items from both reporting periods, 2011 net income
would have been $19,854, or $0.34 per share compared to $33,362, or $0.56 per
share, as in 2010. 
Griffon evaluates performance based on Earnings
    per share and Net income (loss) excluding restructuring charges, gain (loss)
    on debt extinguishment, discrete tax items and acquisition-related expenses including the impact of the fair value of inventory acquired as part of a business combination (a non-GAAP measure). Griffon
    believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason. The
    following table provides a reconciliation of Earnings per share and Net income
    (loss) to Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted
income (loss):

Griffon evaluates performance and allocates resources based on each
segments operating results before interest income or expense, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization, gain (losses) from debt extinguishment,
unallocated amounts, restructuring charges and acquisition-related expenses
including the impact of the fair value of inventory acquired as part of a business
combination (a non-GAAP measure). Griffon believes this information is useful
to investors for the same reason. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of
    Segment operating profit before depreciation, amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related expenses including the impact of the fair value
    of inventory acquired as part of a business combination to Income before

2012 Compared to 2011 
Segment
revenue increased $16,804, or 2%, compared to the prior year. ATT revenue was
flat with the prior year, mainly because of weak snow tool sales, driven by the
absence of snow throughout much of the country during the 2011-2012 winter, and
lower lawn tool volume due to the severe drought conditions experienced throughout
much of the U.S. during the year. These declines were substantially offset by
the inclusion of Southern Patio, acquired in October 2011. CBP revenue
increased 4% due to a combination of favorable mix (2%) and higher volume (2%).

Segment
operating profit in 2012 was $37,082 compared to $28,228 in 2011. Segment
operating results in 2011 reflected $15,152 of costs of goods related to the
sale of inventory recorded at fair value in connection with the ATT acquisition
accounting; excluding the $15,152 of costs, segment operating profit would have
been $43,380 for 2011. The decline in operating profit in 2012 from the
adjusted $43,380 in 2011 resulted from the weak snow tool sales and lower lawn
tool volume due to the drought conditions. The impact of these declines was
partially offset by the inclusion of Southern Patio, as well as improved CBP
profitability driven by improved volume, favorable mix, lower warehouse and
distribution costs, and lower restructuring costs. 
2011 Compared to 2010 
Segment
revenue increased $450,370, or 116%, compared to the prior year primarily due
to the acquisition of ATT. On a pro forma basis, as if ATT was purchased on
October 1, 2009, revenue increased $6,736, or 1%, compared to the prior year.
On this same pro forma basis, ATT 2011 revenue decreased 2% from 2010, driven
mainly by lower volume, primarily lawn tools; CBP 2011 revenue increased 4%,
driven mainly by a favorable shift in mix, partially offset by a 1% decrease in
volume. 
Segment
operating profit in 2011 was $28,228 compared to $4,986 in 2010, with the
inclusion of ATT operations the primary source of increase. Segment operating
results in 2011 reflected $15,152 of costs of goods related to the sale of
inventory recorded at fair value in connection with the ATT acquisition
accounting. On a pro forma basis, as if ATT was purchased on October 1, 2009,
segment operating profit in 2010 was $47,490 compared to $28,228 in 2011; the
$15,152 inventory item was the primary cause of decline in 2011, augmented by
the impact of higher input costs, lower volume and a decline of $2,919 in Byrd
Amendment receipts (anti-dumping compensation from the U.S. Government). The
2010 pro forma operating income included $7,986 of costs related to the ATT
acquisition. 
37


Restructuring 
In
2012, ATT had restructuring costs of $874, primarily related to a facility
closure and termination benefits for administrative and production staff, and
$477 of integration costs related to the Southern Patio acquisition. In 2011,
ATT had $886 in restructuring costs primarily related to termination benefits
for administrative related headcount reductions and $446 of acquisition costs
related to the Southern Patio acquisition. Headcount was reduced by 38 over the
two year period. 
In
June 2009, CBP undertook to consolidate its manufacturing facilities. These
actions were completed in 2011. CBP incurred total pre-tax exit and
restructuring costs approximating $9,031, substantially all of which were cash
charges; charges include $1,160 for one-time termination benefits and other
personnel costs, $210 for excess facilities and related costs, and $7,661 for
other exit costs, primarily in connection with production realignment, and had
$10,365 of capital expenditures. The restructuring costs were $3,611 in 2011, $4,180
in 2010 and $1,240 in 2009.

2012 Compared to 2011 
Telephonics
revenue decreased $13,850, or 3%, compared to 2011. 2012 and 2011 revenue
included $24,101 and $44,305, respectively, related to revenue for Counter
Remote Control Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare 3.1 (CREW 3.1)
program, where Telephonics serves as a subcontractor. Excluding Crew 3.1 from
both years, revenue increased 2% over the prior year due to radar growth driven
by Light Airborne Multi-Purpose Systems Multi Mode Radar (LAMPS MMR),
partially offset by the impact from the timing of awards on Ground Surveillance
Radars (GSR) related to the Cerberus program. 
Segment
operating profit increased $8,637, or 21%, mainly driven by higher gross profit
from a combination of favorable program mix and manufacturing efficiencies,
partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses
primarily due to the timing of proposal activities. Operating results also
benefited from cost reductions resulting from the voluntary early retirement
plan undertaken in the prior year and other restructuring activities
implemented in early 2012. 
During
the year, Telephonics was awarded several new contracts and received
incremental funding on current contracts resulting in approximately $475,000 of
net bookings. Contract backlog was $451,000 at September 30, 2012 with 70%
expected to be realized in the next 12 months; backlog was $417,000 at
September 30, 2011. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and
services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the
customer, or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. 
On
August 1, 2012, Telephonics signed a definitive agreement to form a Joint
Venture (JV) with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., one of Indias leading
business houses, to provide the Indian Ministry of Defense and the Indian Civil
sector with radar and surveillance systems, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)
devices and communication systems. In addition, the JV intends to provide
systems for Air Traffic Management Services, Homeland Security and other
emerging surveillance requirements.
38


2011 Compared to 2010 
Telephonics
revenue increased $20,837, or 5%, compared to 2010 primarily due to increases
in radar and electronic systems, partially offset by a decrease in
communication systems. Telephonics continued to benefit from strong demand for
its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products. Electronic systems
growth was primarily from GSR and Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC)
programs, and radar growth was driven by LAMPS MMR. The increases were
partially offset by timing on the Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and
Discrimination (ARPDD) program from the development to the production phase
and the lower rate of production on the C-17 program. 2011 and 2010 revenue
included $44,305 and $46,426, respectively, related to revenue for CREW 3.1. 
Segment
operating profit increased $2,009, or 5%, due to revenue growth, partially
offset by costs related to a voluntary early retirement plan and other
restructuring costs of $3,046. 
Restructuring 
In
2012 and 2011, Telephonics recognized $3,815 and $3,046 of restructuring
charges in connection with two discrete voluntary early retirement plans and
other restructuring costs related to changes in its organizational structure
and facilities; such charges were primarily related to personnel reducing
headcount by approximately 185 employees over the two-year period.

2012 Compared to 2011 
Revenue
in 2012 increased $27,389, or 5%, compared to 2011, driven by a 10% increase in
volume. The benefit of the volume growth was partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of translation of European and Brazilian revenue into a
stronger U.S. dollar (5%). Resin did not significantly impact reported revenue
for the full year 2012; Plastics adjusts customer selling prices based on
underlying resin costs, on a delayed basis. 
Segment
operating profit increased $380 compared to the prior year primarily driven by
the higher volume, a $3,700 favorable resin benefit and efficiency improvement
on past capital initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange (2%) and a shift in product mix, as well as somewhat higher
selling, general and administrative expenses. 
2011 Compared to 2010 
Plastics
revenue increased $65,599, or 14%, compared to the prior year primarily due to
higher unit volumes (6%) in North America and Europe, the pass through of
higher resin costs in customer selling prices (5%) and the translation of
European results into a weaker U.S. dollar (3%). 
39


Segment
operating profit decreased $7,161 compared to the prior year, driven by start
up costs, in both Germany and Brazil, related to expanding capacity and product
offerings to meet increased customer demand; such start up costs included
higher than normal levels of scrap production. There were no significant
disruptions in customer service in connection with the scaling up of production
of newly installed assets. The decline was partially offset by higher volume
and a timing benefit from resin pricing. 
Unallocated Amounts 
For
2012, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs,
totaled $26,346 compared to $22,868 in 2011, with the increase primarily due to
stock and incentive compensation. 
For
2011, unallocated amounts totaled $22,868 compared to $27,394 in 2010, with the
decrease primarily due to the absence of legal and consulting expenses incurred
in connection with the due diligence of potential acquisition targets in 2010,
as well as reduced incentive compensation costs. 
Segment Depreciation and Amortization 
Segment
depreciation and amortization of $65,864 increased $5,503 in 2012 compared to
2011 primarily due to the increased depreciation and amortization related to
the Southern Patio acquisition and capital expansion at Plastics and CBP. 
Segment
depreciation and amortization of $60,361 increased $20,258 in 2011 compared to
2010, primarily due to the increased depreciation and amortization related to
the ATT acquisition as well as the capital expansion at Plastics. 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  Installation Services 
In
2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon
exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services
segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers,
fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building
products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven
units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of
substantially all of this segment have been reported as discontinued operations
    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented; the
Installation Services segment is excluded from segment reporting. 
Griffon
substantially concluded remaining disposal activities in 2009. There was no
reported revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Griffon does not expect to incur
significant expenses in the future. Future net cash outflows to satisfy
liabilities related to disposal activities accrued as of September 30, 2012 are
estimated to be $7,282. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Management assesses
Griffons liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its
operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting
liquidity are: cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract
long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon remains in a strong
financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in
existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital
structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.

Cash
flows generated by operating activities for 2012 increased $54,745, to $90,130
compared to $35,385 in 2011. Current assets net of current liabilities,
excluding short-term debt and cash, decreased $5,630 to $360,881 at September
30, 2012 compared to $366,511 at the prior year end, primarily due to decreased
accounts receivable partially offset by decreased accounts payable. 
During
2012, Griffon used cash in investing activities of $90,974 compared to $82,233
in 2011; the 2012 uses reflected the acquisition on Southern Patio ($22,432).
In 2012, capital expenditures totaled $68,851 compared to $87,617 in 2011, with
the decrease being driven primarily by decreased capital expenditures at
Plastics. 
During
2012, cash used by financing activities was $30,693 compared to cash provided
by financing activities of $122,110 in the prior year primarily due to
repayments of long-term borrowings, the repurchase of common stock ($10,382)
and the payment of dividends ($4,743). Prior year cash provided was primarily
due to the refinancing of subsidiary debt at the parent level. 
Payments
related to Telephonics revenue are received in accordance with the terms of development
and production subcontracts; certain of such receipts are progress or
performance based payments. Plastics customers are generally substantial
industrial companies whose payments have been steady, reliable and made in
accordance with the terms governing such sales. Plastics sales satisfy orders
that are received in advance of production, and where payment terms are
established in advance. With respect to HBP, there have been no material
adverse impacts on payment for sales. 
A
small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account
for, a substantial portion of Griffons consolidated revenue. For 2012: 



 


 


 




 


a.


The U.S. Government and its agencies, through
either prime or subcontractor relationships, represented 19% of Griffons consolidated
revenue and 79% of Telephonics revenue.




 


b.


Procter & Gamble, Co. represented 13% of Griffons consolidated
revenue and 43% of Plastics revenue.




 


c.


The Home Depot represented 12% of Griffons consolidated revenue and
25% of HBP revenue.



No
other customer exceeded 9% of consolidated revenue. Future operating results
will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffons largest
customers and Griffons relationships with them. Orders from these customers
are subject to fluctuation and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a
portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse
impact on Griffons liquidity and operations.

On
March 17, 2011, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under
Rule 144A, Griffon issued, at par, $550,000 of 7.125% Senior Notes due in 2018
(Senior Notes); interest is payable semi-annually. On August 9, 2011, Griffon
exchanged all of the Senior Notes for substantially identical Senior Notes
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (Senior Notes), via an exchange
offer. Proceeds were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under a senior
secured term loan facility and two senior secured revolving credit facilities of
certain of the Companys subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and are
subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. The fair value of
the Senior Notes approximated $580,250 on September 30, 2012 based upon quoted
market prices (level 1 inputs). 
On
March 18, 2011, Griffon entered into a five-year $200,000 Revolving Credit
Facility (Credit Agreement), which included a letter of credit sub-facility
with a limit of $50,000, a multi-currency sub-facility of $50,000 and a
swingline sub-facility with a limit of $30,000. Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time, subject to final maturity
of the facility or the occurrence of a default or event of default under the
Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a LIBOR or base
rate benchmark rate plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial
performance. The margins are 1.75% for base rate loans and 2.75% for LIBOR
loans, in each case without a floor. The Credit Agreement has certain financial
maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior
secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as
customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The Credit
Agreement also includes certain restrictions, such as limitations on the
incurrence of indebtedness and liens and the making of restricted payments and
investments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain
domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by
substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors. 
At
September 30, 2012, there were $21,693 of standby letters of credit outstanding
under the Credit Agreement; $178,307 was available for borrowing at that date. 
On
December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4% convertible
subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes). The initial conversion rate of
the 2017 Notes was 67.0799 shares of Griffons common stock per $1,000
principal amount of notes, corresponding to an initial conversion price of
$14.91 per share, a 23% conversion premium over the $12.12 closing price on
December 15, 2009. When a cash dividend is declared that would result in an
adjustment to the conversion ratio of less than 1%, any adjustment to the
conversion ratio is deferred until the first to occur of (i) actual conversion,
(ii) the 42nd trading day prior to maturity of the notes, and (iii) such time
as the cumulative adjustment equals or exceeds 1%. As of September 30, 2012,
 aggregate dividends of $0.08 per share resulted in a cumulative change
in the conversion rate of 0.86%. Griffon used 8.75% as the nonconvertible
debt-borrowing rate to discount the 2017 Notes and will amortize the debt
discount through January 2017. At issuance, the debt component of the 2017
Notes was $75,437 and debt discount was $24,563. At September
30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the 2017 Notes had a capital in excess of par
component, net of tax, of $15,720. The fair value of the 2017 Notes
approximated $102,000 on September 30, 2012 based upon quoted market prices
(level 1 inputs).

On
December 20, 2010, Griffon entered into two second lien real estate mortgages
to secure new loans totaling $11,834. The loans mature in February 2016, are
collateralized by the related properties and are guaranteed by Griffon. The
loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3% with the option to swap to a
fixed rate. 
Griffon
has other real estate mortgages, collateralized by real property, which bear
interest at 6.3% and mature in 2016. On October 3, 2011, the mortgage at
Russia, Ohio was paid in full, on maturity. 
Griffons
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) entered into a loan agreement in August
2010 to borrow $20,000 over a one-year period. The proceeds were used to
purchase 1,874,737 shares of Griffon common stock in the open market for
$19,973. The loan bears interest at a) LIBOR plus 2.5% or b) the lenders prime
rate, at Griffons option. In November 2011, Griffon exercised an option to
convert the outstanding loan to a five-year term loan; principal is payable in
quarterly installments of $250, beginning December 2011, with a balloon payment
of $15,223 due at maturity (November 2016). The loan is secured by shares
purchased with the proceeds of the loan, and repayment is guaranteed by
Griffon. At September 30, 2012, $18,973 was outstanding. 
In
addition, the ESOP has a loan agreement, guaranteed by Griffon, which requires
quarterly principal payments of $156 and interest through the extended
expiration date of December 2013 at which time the $3,125 balance of the loan,
and any outstanding interest, will be payable. The primary purpose of this loan
was to purchase 547,605 shares of Griffons common stock in October 2008. The
loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan, and
repayment is guaranteed by Griffon. The loan bears interest at rates based upon
the prime rate or LIBOR. At September 30, 2012, $3,750 was outstanding. 
In
October 2006, CBP entered into a capital lease totaling $14,290 for real estate
in Troy, Ohio. Approximately $10,000 was used to acquire the building and the
remaining amount was restricted for improvements. The lease matures in 2021,
bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.1%, is secured by a mortgage on the real
estate and is guaranteed by Griffon. 
At
September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, Griffon had $532 of 4% convertible
subordinated notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) outstanding. Holders of the 2023
Notes may require Griffon to repurchase all or a portion of their 2023 Notes on
July 18, 2013 and 2018, if Griffons common stock price is below the conversion
price of the 2023 Notes, as well as upon a change in control. An adjustment to
the conversion rate will be required as the result of payment of a cash dividend
only if such adjustment would be greater than 1% (or at such time as the
cumulative impact on the conversion rate reaches 1% in the aggregate). As of
September 30, 2012, aggregate dividends of $0.08 per share resulted in
a cumulative change in the conversion rate of 0.89%. At September 30, 2012 and
September 30, 2011, the 2023 Notes had no capital in excess of par value
component as substantially all of these notes were put to Griffon at par and
settled in July 2010. The fair value of the 2023 Notes approximated $544 on
September 30, 2012 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). 
In
November 2010, Clopay Europe GMBH (Clopay Europe) entered into a 10,000
revolving credit facility and a 20,000 term loan. The facility accrues
interest at Euribor plus 2.1% per annum (2.3% at September 30, 2012), and the
term loan accrues interest at Euribor plus 2.2% per annum (2.4% at September
30, 2012). The revolving facility matures in November 2012, but is renewable
upon mutual agreement with the bank. Subsequent to September 30, 2012 the line
was renewed for an additional year to November 2013. In July 2011, the full
20,000 was drawn on the Term Loan, with a portion of the proceeds used to
repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The term loan is payable
in ten equal quarterly installments which began in September 2011, with maturity
in December 2013. Under the term loan, Clopay Europe is required to maintain a
certain minimum equity to assets ratio and keep leverage
below a certain level, defined as the ratio of total debt to EBITDA. At
September 30, 2012, there were no borrowings on the revolving credit with
10,000 available for borrowing.

In
February 2012, Clopay do Brazil, a subsidiary of Plastics, borrowed $4,000 at a
rate of 104.5% of Brazilian CDI (7.7% at September 30, 2012). The loan was used
to refinance existing loans and is collateralized by accounts receivable and a
50% guaranty by Plastics and is to be repaid in four equal, semi-annual
installments of principal plus accrued interest beginning in August 2012.
Clopay do Brazil also maintains lines of credit of approximately $4,200.
Interest on borrowings accrue at a rate of Brazilian CDI plus 6.0% or a fixed
rate (13.8% and 10.2%, respectively, at September 30, 2012). At September 30,
2012 there was approximately $2,064 borrowed under the lines. 
At
September 30, 2012, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the
terms and covenants of all credit and loan agreements. 
In
August 2011, Griffons Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$50,000 of Griffons outstanding common stock; this was in addition to the
1,366,000 shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under an existing
buyback program. Under the repurchase programs, the Company may, from time to
time, purchase shares of its common stock, depending upon market conditions, in
open market or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a
10b5-1 plan. During 2011, Griffon purchased 1,531,379 shares of common stock,
for a total of $12,367, or $8.08 per share, exhausting the shares under the
original program; $48,690 remained under the $50,000 authorization. During
2012, Griffon purchased 1,187,066 shares of common stock under the plan for a
total of $10,379, or $8.74 per share; $38,312 remains under the $50,000
authorization. 
On
November 17, 2011, the Company began declaring quarterly dividends at $0.02 per
share; a total of $0.08 per share, for a total of $4,743, was
declared and paid in 2012. No cash dividends on Common Stock were declared or
paid during the four years ended September 30, 2011. The Company currently intends
to pay dividends each quarter; however, the payment of dividends is determined
by the Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no
assurance can be provided as to future dividends. 
On
November 13, 2012, the Company declared a $0.025 per share dividend payable on
December 26, 2012 to shareholders of record as of November 29, 2012.
During
the year ended September 30, 2012, Griffon used cash for discontinued
operations of $2,801, primarily related to settling remaining Installation
Services liabilities.

(a)


Purchase
 obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the
 ordinary course of business. Griffon uses blanket purchase orders to
 communicate expected requirements to certain vendors. Purchase obligations
 reflect those purchase orders where the commitment is considered to be firm.
 Purchase obligations that extend beyond 2012 are principally related to
 long-term contracts received from customers of Telephonics.




 


 


 




 


(b)


Griffon
 funds required payouts under the non-qualified supplemental defined benefit
 plan from its general assets and the expected payments are included in each
 period, as applicable.




 


 


 




 


(c)


Due
 to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax
 positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of related payments,
 if any, that will be made subsequent to 2012. These amounts do not include
 any potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for
 payments made to other jurisdictions.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
Except
for operating leases and purchase obligations as disclosed herein, Griffon is
not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
Off-Set Agreements 
Telephonics
may enter into  industrial  cooperation  agreements,  sometimes  referred  to as
offset  agreements,  as a condition  to  obtaining  orders for its  products and
services  from  customers  in  foreign   countries.   These  agreements  promote
investment in the country,  and may be satisfied through  activities that do not
require Griffon to use its cash, including  transferring  technology,  providing
manufacturing  and  other  consulting  support.  These  agreements  may  also be
satisfied  through the use of cash for such  activities as  purchasing  supplies
from in-country  vendors,  setting up support centers,  research and development
investments,  acquisitions  and building or leasing  facilities  for  in-country
operations, if applicable. The amount of the offset requirement is determined by
contract value awarded and negotiated  percentages with customers.  At September
30, 2012,  Telephonics had outstanding offset agreements totaling  approximately
$65,000,  primarily  related to the Radar Systems segment,  some of which extend
through  2024.  Offset  programs  usually  extend over several years and in some
cases  provide for penalties in the event Griffon fails to perform in accordance
with contract requirements.  Historically,  Telephonics has not been required to
pay any such  penalties  and as of September  30, 2012,  no such  penalties  are
estimable or probable.


45


ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS 
Critical Accounting Policies 
The preparation of Griffons consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and
subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect
supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including
information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These
estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and
based on historical experience, current conditions and various other
assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets
and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment
for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from
these estimates. 
An estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if
changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material
impact on Griffons financial position or results of operations. The following
have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates: 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied:
a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred,
title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and determinable
and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on terms which
transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue recognition
from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title
and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by
customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than standard
product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other
significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain
customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or
discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of
which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue
and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances
based upon historical returns experience. 
46


Telephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a
prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well
as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts
are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and
profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on
fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production
requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to
date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method).
Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the
ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at
completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the
cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a
contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit
margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the amount of
cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods. As
this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these projections may
be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of this formula and
ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at
completion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on long-term
contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well as when
information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current
estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contracts estimated costs at
completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is
gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work
required under the contract may or may not  change, or if contract modifications
occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a
cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. Gross profit is affected by a variety of
factors, including the mix of products, systems and services, production
efficiencies, price competition and general economic conditions. 
Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts are recognized
as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the
allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit
on a cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the
contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are
recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are
reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated. 
For contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected
revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A
provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a
cumulative basis. 
Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in
revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is
probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by
the cost-to-cost method. 
Inventories 
Inventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or
average) or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. 
Griffons businesses typically do not require inventory that is
susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells
products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts
awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, either as prime or
subcontractor, and in accordance with customer specifications. Plastics
primarily produces fabricated materials used by customers in the production of
their products and these materials are produced against orders by those
customers. HBP produces doors and non-powered lawn and garden tools in response
to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders,
as applicable. 
Warranty Accruals 
Direct customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain
products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the
product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms
of these warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair
or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and
analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products
involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products
respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on these analyses,
warranty accruals are generally recorded as an increase to cost of sales and
regularly reviewed for adequacy. 
Stock-based Compensation 
Griffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees,
officers and directors in the form of stock options and restricted stock. For
stock option grants made on or after October 1, 2005, expense is recognized
over the awards expected vesting period based on their fair value as
calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Black-Scholes pricing
model uses estimated assumptions for a forfeiture rate, the expected life of
the options and a volatility rate using historical data. 
Compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over
the required service period based on the fair value of the grant calculated as
the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of
grant, and for performance shares, the likelihood of achieving the performance
criteria. 
47


Allowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and
Returns 
Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances
for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent
estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults
on contractual obligations (usually due to customers potential insolvency),
discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and
estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for
certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified, as
well as an amount for customer defaults based on a general formula when it is
determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet
be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are
recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance
for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses. 
Acquisitions 
Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition
date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development
(IPR&D) be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are
expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values
of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Goodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible
Assets, and Impairment 
Griffon has significant intangible and tangible long-lived assets on
its balance sheet which includes goodwill and other intangible assets related
to acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets
acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. As required under GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
are reviewed for impairment annually, for Griffon as of September 30, or more
frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, using
discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit. The testing of goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of
judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting units fair market
value. Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was
determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded
the carrying value of the assets, and no impairment existed as of September 30,
2012. 
Long-lived amortizable intangible assets, such as customer
relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily Property, Plant and
Equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involves
significant assumptions and estimates. Long-lived intangible and tangible
assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted
cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator,
such as change in business, customer loss or obsolete technology, exists. 
Fair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable
at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual
results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key
assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its
prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffons stock price, a change
in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of
Griffons control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or
projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different
estimate of the fair value of Griffons reporting units, which could result in
an impairment charge in the future. 
48


Restructuring reserves 
From time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an
operation. These reserves for both termination and other exit costs require the
use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable,
they could differ materially from the actual costs. 
Income Taxes 
Griffons effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates
and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which
Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is
estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year and a quarterly
income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual
rate. As the year progresses, the estimates are refined based on the years
taxable income as new information becomes available, including year-to-date
financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change
to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required
in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis
of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a
tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been
recorded in the income statement. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset
balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least
quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly. 
Tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in
managements judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as
the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability
associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to
changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law
developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized
in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the
net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and
subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of
years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a
liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally
resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction.
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized
tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffons tax provision and
effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an
unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax
rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability
for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if
it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that
portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties
recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income
tax expense. 
49


Pension Benefits 
Griffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for
certain employees and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans
are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial
assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation
increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine
pension liabilities and assets, as well as pension expense, are reviewed on an
annual basis when modifications to assumptions are made based on current
economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is
determined based on the nature of the plans investments and expectations
for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations
is based on a corporate bond spot-rate  yield curve that matches projected future benefit
    payments with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected
    future benefit payments. The assumptions utilized in recording Griffons
    obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable
    based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences
    in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect
    Griffons financial position or results of
operations. 
The U.S. components of the defined benefit plans, which excludes the
supplemental and post retirement healthcare and insurance benefit plans, are
frozen and have stopped accruing benefits. 
Effective January 1, 2012, the Clopay Pension Plan merged with the Ames
True Temper Inc. Pension Plan. The merged qualified defined benefit plans was
named the Clopay Ames True Temper Plan (CATT Plan). 
The ATT supplemental executive retirement plan was frozen to new
entrants and participants in the plan stopped accruing benefits in 2008. 
Newly issued but not
yet effective accounting pronouncements 
In June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance
    which requires the presentation of comprehensive income, the components of
    net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a
    single continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but
    consecutive statements. The new accounting rules eliminate the option to
    present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement
    of changes in shareholders equity. The new accounting rules will be
    effective for the Company in 2013 and are not expected to have a material
    effect on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that allows
an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment testing of goodwill
and indefinite life intangibles. This guidance is effective for the Company in
2013 and is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial condition
or result of operations.

Item 7A.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 



Interest Rates 
Griffons exposure to market risk for changes
    in interest rates relates primarily to variable interest rate debt and investments
in cash and equivalents. 
The revolving credit facility and certain other of Griffons credit
facilities have a LIBOR-based variable interest rate. Due to the current and
expected level of borrowings under these facilities, a 100 basis point change
in LIBOR would not have a material impact on Griffons results of operations or
liquidity. 
Foreign Exchange 
Griffon conducts business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in
Canada, Mexico, Europe, Brazil, Turkey, China, Sweden, Australia and Mexico;
therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the
financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. Griffon
has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its
non-U.S. operations. Griffon may, from time to time, hedge its currency risk
exposures. A change of 10% or less in the value of all applicable foreign
currencies would not have a material effect on Griffons financial position and
cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM



 




Board of
 Directors and Shareholders 




Griffon Corporation 



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Griffon
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
September 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2012. We
also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2). These
financial statements and financial statement schedule is the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements, financial statement schedule and an opinion on Griffon
Corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Griffon
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012 and 2011, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. In addition, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework
issued by COSO.

GRIFFON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
 (Unless otherwise
indicated, all references to years or year-end refer to Griffons fiscal period
ending September 30) 
NOTE 1  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Description of Business 
Griffon Corporation (the Company or Griffon), is a diversified
management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates
resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides
direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and
growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. Griffon to
further diversify, also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will
acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on
capital. 
Headquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is
incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
trades under the symbol GFF. 
Griffon currently conducts its operations through three segments: 



 


 


 


 


 




 





Home & Building Products (HBP) consists of two companies, Ames
 True Temper, Inc (ATT) and Clopay Building Products (CBP): 




 




 


 


-


ATT, acquired by Griffon on September 30, 2010, is a global provider
 of non-powered landscaping products that make work easier for homeowners and
 professionals. Due to the acquisition of ATT occurring on September 30, 2010,
 none of ATTs results of operations were included in Griffons results prior
 to October 1, 2010. 




 




 


 


-


CBP is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential, commercial
 and industrial garage doors to professional installing dealers and major home
 center retail chains. 




 




 





Telephonics Corporation (Telephonics) designs, develops and
 manufactures high-technology integrated information, communication and sensor
 system solutions to military and commercial markets worldwide. 




 




 





Clopay Plastic Products Company (Plastics) is an international
 leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed
 specialty plastic films used in a variety of hygienic, health-care and
 industrial applications. 



Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Griffon
and all subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 
Earnings Per Share 
Due to rounding, the sum of earnings per share of Continuing operations
and Discontinued operations may not equal earnings per share of Net income. 
57


GRIFFON CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
Discontinued Operations  Installation
Services 
In 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential
    housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of
    its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage
    doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of
    related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market.
    Operating results of substantially all of this segment have been reported
    as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
    all periods presented; the Installation Services segment is excluded from
    segment reporting. 
Reclassifications and Adoption of New
Accounting Guidance 
Certain
amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods. These estimates may be adjusted due to changes in economic,
industry or customer financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or
demand. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts
receivable and returns, net realizable value of inventories, restructuring
reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, percentage of completion
method of accounting, pension assumptions, useful lives associated with
depreciation and amortization of intangible and fixed assets, warranty
reserves, sales incentive accruals, stock based compensation assumptions,
income taxes and tax valuation reserves, environmental reserves, legal
reserves, insurance reserves and the valuation of discontinued assets and
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on
managements best knowledge of current events and actions Griffon may undertake
in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
Cash and equivalents 
Griffon considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents primarily consist of overnight commercial paper, highly-rated
liquid money market funds backed by U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Agency
securities, as well as insured bank deposits. Griffon had cash in non-U.S. bank
accounts of approximately $15,914 and $39,738 at September 30, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. Substantially all U.S. cash and equivalents are covered by
government insurance or backed by government securities. Griffon regularly
evaluates the financial stability of all institutions and funds that hold its
cash and equivalents. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts and notes payable and revolving credit debt approximate fair value due
to either the short-term nature of such instruments or the fact that the
interest rate of the revolving credit debt is based upon current market rates. 
The fair values of Griffons 2018 senior notes, 2017 and 2023 4%
convertible notes approximated $580,250, $102,000 and $544, respectively on
September 30, 2012. Fair values were based upon quoted market prices (level 1
inputs). 
58


GRIFFON CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
Insurance contracts with a value of $4,183 and trading securities with
a value of $697 at September 30, 2012, are measured and recorded at fair value
based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (level 1
inputs). 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring
Basis 
At September 30, 2012, Griffon had $1,500 of Australian dollar
contracts at a weighted average rate of $0.966. The contracts, which protect
Australia operations from currency fluctuations for U.S. dollar based
purchases, do not qualify for hedge accounting and a fair value loss of $1 was
recorded in other assets and to other income for the outstanding contracts
based on similar contract values (level 2 inputs) for the year ended September
30, 2012. All contracts expire in 15 to 75 days. 
Pension plan assets with a fair value of $160,833 at September 30,
2012, are measured and recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets (level 1 inputs), quoted market prices for
similar assets (level 2 inputs) and derived by audited financial statements
(level 3 inputs). 
Non-U.S. currency translation 
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange
rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average
exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from currency translation have been
recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as cumulative translation adjustments.
Assets and liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies other
than that entitys functional currency are remeasured into the functional
currency using period end exchange rates, or historical rates where applicable
to certain balances. Gains and losses arising on remeasurements are recorded
within the Statement of Operations as a component of Other income (expense). 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied:
a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred,
title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and
determinable and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on
terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue
recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including
transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon
receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than
standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other
significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain
customers rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or
discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of
which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue
and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances
based upon historical returns experience.

GRIFFON CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
Telephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a
prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well
as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts
are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and
profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on
fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production
requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to
date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method).
Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the
ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at
completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the
cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit  recorded on a
contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the
amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior
periods. As this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these
projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of
this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and
total costs at completion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on
long-term contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well
as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the
current estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contracts estimated costs at
completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is
gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work
required under the contract may or may not change, or if contract modifications
occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a
cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. Gross
profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products,
systems and services, production efficiencies, price competition and general
economic conditions. 
Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts are recognized
as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable
costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a
cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual
fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as
revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of
being met and can be estimated. 
For contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed the total expected
revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A
provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a
cumulative basis. 
Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in
revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is
probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by
the cost-to-cost method. 
Accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful
accounts and concentrations of credit risk 
Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or services on account
and is stated at historical cost. A substantial portion of Griffons trade
receivables are from customers of HBP, of which the largest customer is Home
Depot, whose financial condition is dependent on the construction and related
retail sectors of the economy. In addition, a significant portion of Griffons
trade receivables are from one Plastics customer, P&G, whose financial
condition is dependent on the consumer products and related sectors of the
economy. As a percentage of consolidated accounts receivable, U.S. Government
related programs was 18%, while Home Depot and P&G were each under 10%.
Griffon performs continuing evaluations of the financial condition of its
customers, and although Griffon generally does not require collateral, letters
of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances. 
Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowance for
doubtful accounts and, when appropriate, for customer program reserves and cash
discounts. The allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables
associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually
due to customers potential insolvency). The allowance for doubtful accounts
includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been
specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults based on a
formula when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and
estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The provision
related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded in SG&A
expenses.

Customer program reserves and cash discounts are netted against
accounts receivable when it is customer practice to reduce invoices for these
amounts. The amount netted against accounts receivable in 2012 and 2011 was
$8,653 and $12,683, respectively. 
Contract costs and recognized income not yet
billed 
Contract costs and recognized income not yet billed consists of amounts
accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting,
recoverable costs and accrued profit that cannot yet be invoiced under the terms
of certain long-term contracts. Amounts will be invoiced when applicable
contract terms such as the achievement of specified milestones or product
delivery, are met. 
Inventories 
Inventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average)
or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. 
Griffons businesses typically do not require inventory that is
susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells
products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts
awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, either as prime or
subcontractor, and in accordance with customer specifications. Plastics
produces fabricated materials used by customers in the production of their
products and these materials are produced against orders by those customers.
HBP produces doors and non-powered lawn and garden tools in response to orders
from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as
applicable. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment includes the historical cost of land,
buildings, equipment and significant improvements to existing plant and
equipment. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are
expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed
of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the
respective accounts and the gain or loss is realized in income. 
Depreciation expense, which includes amortization of assets under
capital leases, was $58,216, $52,844 and $38,456 for the years ended September
30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for
property, plant and equipment are as follows: buildings and building
improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 2 to 15 years and
leasehold improvements, over the term of the lease or life of the improvement,
whichever is shorter. 
Capitalized interest costs included in property, plant and equipment
were $2,975, $2,250 and $1,700 for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. The original cost of fully-depreciated property, plant and
equipment remaining in use at September 30, 2012 was approximately $195,000. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles 
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of a business over the
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized,
but is subject to an annual impairment test unless during an interim period,
impairment indicators, such as a significant change in the business climate,
exist. 
Griffon performed its annual impairment testing
    of goodwill as of September 30, 2012. The performance of the test involves
a two-step process. The first step 
61


GRIFFON CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
 involves comparing the fair value of Griffons reporting
    units with the reporting units carrying amount, including
goodwill. Griffon generally determines the fair value of its reporting units
using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the present
value of expected future cash flows. This method uses Griffons own market
assumptions. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting
units fair
value, Griffon performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step compares the implied
fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of
that goodwill. 
Griffon defines its reporting units as its three segments. 
Griffon used five year projections and a 3.0% terminal value to which
discount rates between 9.5% and 11.5% were applied to calculate each units
fair value. To substantiate fair values derived from the income approach
methodology of valuation, the implied fair value was reconciled to Griffons
market capitalization, the results of which supported the implied fair values.
Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a
reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffons
stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or
other factors outside Griffons control, or significant underperformance
relative to historical or project future operating results, could result in a
significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units,
which could result in a future impairment charge. 
Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was
determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded
the carrying value of the assets, as performed under step one, and no
impairment existed. 
Similar to Goodwill, Griffon tests indefinite-lived intangible assets
at least annually and when indicators of impairment exist. Griffon uses a
discounted cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair value of the
intangible to its book value. This method uses Griffons own market assumptions
which are reasonable and supportable. If the fair value is less than the book
value of the indefinite-lived intangibles, an impairment charge would be
recognized. There was no impairment related to any indefinite-lived intangible
assets in 2012. 
Definite-lived long-lived assets 
Amortizable intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. For financial reporting purposes, definite-lived intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives,
generally eight to twenty-five years. Long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. 
For 2012 and 2011, the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated from the use of definite-lived long-lived assets were substantially
greater than the carrying value of the assets, and as such, there was no
impairment. 
Income taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred
taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. The
carrying value of Griffons deferred tax assets is dependent upon Griffons
ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions.
Should Griffon determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be
established in the period such determination was made.

Griffon provides for uncertain tax positions and any related interest
and penalties based upon Managements assessment of whether a tax benefit is
more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At
September 30, 2012 Griffon believes that it has appropriately accounted for all
unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Griffon has
recorded unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $11,876, $12,910 and
$11,764, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax
matters are recorded in the provision for income taxes. 
Research and development costs, shipping and
handling costs and advertising costs 
Research and development costs not recoverable under contractual
arrangements are charged to SG&A expense as incurred and amounted to
$23,600, $23,900 and $21,400 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
SG&A expenses include shipping and handling costs of $40,200 in
2012, $41,600 in 2011 and $32,100 in 2010 and advertising costs, which are
expensed as incurred, of $22,000 in 2012, $23,000 in 2011 and $14,700 in 2010. 
Risk, Retention and Insurance 
Griffons property and casualty insurance programs contain various
deductibles that, based on Griffons experience, are typical and customary for
a company of its size and risk profile. Griffon generally maintains deductibles
for claims and liabilities related primarily to workers compensation, general,
product and automobile liability as well as property damage and business
interruption losses resulting from certain events. Griffon does not consider
any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to Griffon. Griffon accrues
for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably
estimated. Insurance is maintained to transfer risk beyond the level of
self-retention and provides protection on both an individual claim and annual
aggregate basis. 
In the U.S., Griffon currently self-assumes its general and product
liability claims up to $350 per occurrence and its workers compensation and
automobile liability claims up to $250 per occurrence. Third-party insurance
provides primary level coverage in excess of these deductible amounts up to
certain specified limits. In addition, Griffon has excess liability insurance
from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an individual occurrence
basis substantially in excess of the limits of the primary coverage. 
Griffon has local insurance coverage in Germany, Brazil, Canada,
Ireland, Australia, Turkey, Mexico and China which is subject to reasonable
deductibles. Griffon has worldwide excess coverage above these local programs. 
Griffon Corporation and its U.S. subsidiaries also self assume health
related claims to a maximum of $300 per participant, per year.

Pension Benefits 
Griffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit
    pension plans for certain employees and retired employees. Annual amounts
relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which
    include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed
rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial
assumptions used to determine pension liabilities and assets, as well as pension
    expense, are reviewed on an annual basis when modifications to assumptions
    are made based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return
    on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans
investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate
used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve
that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate spot rate
applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The
assumptions utilized in recording Griffons obligations under the defined
benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable based on experience and
advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or
changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffons financial position
or results of operations. 
The U.S. components of the defined benefit plans, which excludes the
supplemental and post retirement healthcare and insurance benefit plans, are
frozen and have stopped accruing benefits. 
Newly issued but not
yet effective accounting pronouncements 
In June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance
    which requires the presentation of comprehensive income, the components of
    net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a
    single continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but
    consecutive statements. The new accounting rules eliminate the option to
    present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement
    of changes in shareholders equity. The new accounting rules will be
    effective for the Company in 2013 and are not expected to have a material
    effect on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that allows
an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment testing of goodwill
and indefinite life intangibles. This guidance is effective for the Company in
2013 and is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial condition
or result of operations.

NOTE 2  ACQUISITIONS 
On October 17, 2011, Griffon acquired the pots and planters business of
Southern Sales & Marketing Group, Inc. (SSMG) for $22,432. The acquired
business, which markets its products under the Southern Patio brand name
(Southern Patio), is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of
landscape accessories. Southern Patio, which was integrated with ATT, had revenue
exceeding $40,000 in 2011. 
The accounts of the acquired company, after adjustments to reflect fair
market values assigned to assets purchased from SSMG, have been included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition; acquired inventory
was not significant.

On September 30, 2010, Griffon purchased all of the outstanding stock
of CHATT Holdings, Inc. (ATT Holdings), the parent of ATT, on a cash and
debt-free basis, for $542,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the
Purchase Price). ATT is a global provider of non-powered lawn and garden
tools, wheelbarrows, and other outdoor work products to the retail and professional
markets. ATTs brands include Ames®, True Temper®, Ames True Temper®, Garant®,
Union Tools®, Razor-back®, Jackson®, Hound Dog® and Dynamic DesignTM.
ATTs brands hold the number one or number two market positions in their
respective major product categories. The acquisition of ATT expands Griffons
position in the home and building products market and provides Griffon the
opportunity to recognize synergies with its other businesses. 
ATTs results of operations are not included in the Griffon consolidated

thereafter, based on current intangible balances and classifications, is
estimated as follows: 2013 - $7,892; 2014 - $7,658; 2015 - $7,483; 2016 -
$7,355 and 2017 - $7,265; thereafter - $112,568. 
NOTE 6  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
In 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential
    housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of
    its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage
    doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of
    related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market.
    Operating results of substantially all of this segment have been reported
    as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
    all periods presented; the Installation Services segment is excluded from
    segment reporting. 
In 2008, Griffons Board of Directors approved a plan to exit
substantially all operating activities of the Installation Services segment. In
2008, Griffon sold eleven units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP.

Griffon substantially concluded its remaining disposal activities in
2009. There was no reported revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010. 
The following amounts related primarily to the Installation Services
segment have been segregated from Griffons continuing operations and are
reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the
consolidated balance sheets:

NOTE 8  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER RELATED CHARGES

In June 2009, CBP undertook to consolidate its manufacturing
facilities. These actions were completed in 2011. CBP incurred total pre-tax
exit and restructuring costs approximating $9,031, substantially all of which
were cash charges; charges include $1,160 for one-time termination benefits and
other personnel costs, $210 for excess facilities and related costs, and $7,661
for other exit costs, primarily in connection with production realignment, and
had $10,365 of capital expenditures. The restructuring costs were $3,611 in
2011, $4,180 in 2010 and $1,240 in 2009.

NOTE 9  WARRANTY LIABILITY 
Telephonics offers warranties against product defects for periods
generally ranging from one to two years, depending on the specific product and
terms of the customer purchase agreement. Typical warranties require
Telephonics to repair or replace the defective products during the warranty
period at no cost to the customer. At the time revenue is recognized, Griffon
records a liability for warranty costs, estimated based on historical
experience and periodically assesses its warranty obligations and adjusts the
liability as necessary. ATT offers an express limited warranty for a period of
ninety days on all products unless otherwise stated on the product or packaging
from the date of original purchase. 
Changes in
Griffons warranty liability, included in Accrued liabilities, were as follows:

(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)



 


 




(a)


On March 17, 2011, in an unregistered offering through a private placement
under Rule 144A, Griffon issued, at par, $550,000 of 7.125% Senior Notes due
in 2018 (Senior Notes); interest is payable semi-annually. On August 9,
2011, Griffon exchanged all of the Senior Notes for substantially identical
Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (Senior Notes),
via an exchange offer. 




 


 




 


The Senior Notes can be redeemed prior to April 1, 2014 at a price of
100% of principal plus a make-whole premium and accrued interest; on or after
April 1, 2014, the Senior Notes can be redeemed at a certain price (declining
from 105.344% of principal on or after April 1, 2014 to 100% of principal on
or after April 1, 2017), plus accrued interest. Proceeds from the Senior
Notes were used to pay down the outstanding borrowings under a senior secured
term loan facility and two senior secured revolving credit facilities of
certain of the Companys subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and are
subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. 




 


 




 


On March 18, 2011, Griffon entered into a five-year
    $200,000 Revolving Credit Facility (Credit Agreement), which
    included a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $50,000, a multi-currency
    sub-facility of $50,000 and a swingline sub-facility with a limit of $30,000.
    Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any
    time, subject to final maturity of the facility or the occurrence of a default
    or event of default under the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings
    at either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate plus an applicable margin,
    which adjusts based on financial performance. The margins are 1.75% for base
    rate loans and 2.75% for LIBOR loans, in each case without a floor. The Credit
Agreement has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total
leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum
interest coverage ratio as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants
and events of default. The Credit Agreement also includes certain
restrictions, such as limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens
and the making of restricted payments and investments. Borrowings under the
Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries and are
secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all assets of the
Company and the guarantors. 




 


 




 


At September 30, 2012, there were $21,693 of standby letters of
credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement; $178,307 was available for
borrowing at that date. 




 


 




(b)


On December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4%
convertible subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes). The initial
conversion rate of the 2017 Notes was 67.0799 shares of Griffons common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, corresponding to an initial
conversion price of $14.91 per share, a 23% conversion premium over the
$12.12 closing price on December 15, 2009. When a cash dividend is declared
that would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio of less than 1%,
any adjustment to the conversion ratio is deferred until the first to occur
of (i) actual conversion, (ii) the 42nd trading day prior to maturity of the
notes, and (iii) such time as the cumulative adjustment equals or exceeds 1%.
As of September 30, 2012, aggregate dividends of $0.08 per share
resulted in a cumulative change in the conversion rate of 0.86%. Griffon used
8.75% as the nonconvertible debt-borrowing rate to discount the 2017 Notes and
will amortize the debt discount through January 2017. At issuance, the debt
component of the 2017 Notes was $75,437 and debt discount was $24,563. At
September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the 2017 Notes had a capital in
excess of par component, net of tax, of $15,720. 




 


 




(c)


On December 20, 2010, Griffon entered into two second lien real
estate mortgages to secure new loans totaling $11,834. The loans mature in
February 2016, are collateralized by the related properties and are
guaranteed by Griffon. The loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3%
with the option to swap to a fixed rate. 



74


GRIFFON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  (US dollars and non US currencies in
thousands, except per share data)



 

 



 

Griffon has other real estate mortgages, collateralized by real
property, which bear interest at 6.3% and mature in 2016. On October 3, 2011,
the mortgage at Russia, Ohio was paid in full, on maturity. 



 

 



(d)

Griffons Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) entered into a loan
agreement in August 2010 to borrow $20,000 over a one-year period. The
proceeds were used to purchase 1,874,737 shares of Griffon common stock in
the open market for $19,973. The loan bears interest at a) LIBOR plus 2.5% or
b) the lenders prime rate, at Griffons option. In November 2011, Griffon
exercised an option to convert the outstanding loan to a five-year term loan;
principal is payable in quarterly installments of $250, beginning December
2011, with a balloon payment of $15,223 due at maturity (November 2016). The
loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan, and
repayment is guaranteed by Griffon. At September 30, 2012, $18,973 was
outstanding. 



 

 



 

In addition, the ESOP has a loan agreement, guaranteed by Griffon,
which requires quarterly principal payments of $156 and interest through the
extended expiration date of December 2013 at which time the $3,125 balance of
the loan, and any outstanding interest, will be payable. The primary purpose
of this loan was to purchase 547,605 shares of Griffons common stock in
October 2008. The loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of
the loan, and repayment is guaranteed by Griffon. The loan bears interest at
rates based upon the prime rate or LIBOR. At September 30, 2012, $3,750 was
outstanding. 



 

 



(e)

In October 2006, CBP entered into a capital lease totaling $14,290
for real estate in Troy, Ohio. The lease matures in 2021, bears interest at a
fixed rate of 5.1%, is secured by a mortgage on the real estate and is
guaranteed by Griffon. 



 

 



(f)

At September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, Griffon had $532 of 4%
convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) outstanding.
Holders of the 2023 Notes may require Griffon to repurchase all or a portion
of their 2023 Notes on July 18, 2013 and 2018, if Griffons common stock
price is below the conversion price of the 2023 Notes, as well as upon a
change in control. An adjustment to the conversion rate will be required as
the result of payment of a cash dividend only if such adjustment would be
greater than 1% (or at such time as the cumulative impact on the conversion
rate reaches 1% in the aggregate). As of September 30, 2012, aggregate dividends
of $0.08 per share resulted in a cumulative change in the conversion rate of
0.89%. At September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the 2023 Notes had no capital
in excess of par value component as substantially all of these notes were put
to Griffon at par and settled in July 2010. 



 

 



(g)

In November 2010, Clopay Europe GMBH (Clopay Europe) entered into a
10,000 revolving credit facility and a 20,000 term loan. The facility
accrues interest at Euribor plus 2.1% per annum (2.3% at September 30, 2012),
and the term loan accrues interest at Euribor plus 2.2% per annum (2.4% at
September 30, 2012). The revolving facility matures in November 2012, but is
renewable upon mutual agreement with the bank. Subsequent to September 30,
2012 the line was renewed for an additional year to November 2013. In July
2011, the full 20,000 was drawn on the Term Loan, with a portion of the
proceeds used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The
term loan is payable in ten equal quarterly installments which began in
September 2011, with maturity in December 2013. Under the term loan, Clopay
Europe is required to maintain a certain minimum equity to assets ratio and
keep leverage below a certain level, defined as the ratio of total debt to
EBITDA. At September 30, 2012, there were no borrowings on the revolving
credit with 10,000 available for borrowing.

(h)
In February 2012, Clopay do Brazil,
        a subsidiary of Plastics, borrowed $4,000 at a rate of 104.5% of Brazilian
        CDI (7.7% at September 30, 2012). The loan was used to refinance existing
        loans and is collateralized by accounts receivable and a 50% guaranty by Plastics
and is to be repaid in four equal, semi-annual installments of principal plus
accrued interest beginning in August 2012. Clopay do Brazil also maintains
lines of credit of approximately $4,200. Interest on borrowings accrue at a
rate of Brazilian CDI plus 6.0% or a fixed rate (13.8% or 10.2%,
respectively, at September 30, 2012). At September 30, 2012 there was
approximately $2,064 borrowed under the lines. 



 

 



(i)

In connection with the ATT acquisition, Clopay Ames True Temper
Holding Corp. (Clopay Ames), a subsidiary of Griffon, entered into a
$375,000 secured term Loan (Term Loan) and a $125,000 asset based lending
agreement (ABL). 



 

 



 

On November
30, 2010, Clopay Ames, as required under the Term Loan agreement, entered
into an interest rate swap on a notional amount of $200,000 of the Term Loan.
The agreement fixed the LIBOR component of the Term Loan interest rate at
2.085% for the notional amount of the swap. 



 

 



 

On March 17, 2011, the Term Loan and swap were terminated, and on
March 18, 2011, the ABL was terminated, in connection with the issuance of
the Senior Notes and Credit Agreement. 



 

 



(j)

In March 2008, Telephonics entered into a credit agreement with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party
thereto, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide a five-year, revolving
credit facility of $100,000 (the TCA). The TCA terminated in connection
with the Credit Agreement. 



 

 



(k)

Includes capital leases. 


At September 30, 2012, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance
with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements. 
In 2011, in connection with the termination of the Term Loan, ABL and
Telephonics credit agreement, Griffon recorded a $26,164 loss on extinguishment
of debt consisting of $21,617 of deferred financing charges and original issuer
discounts, a call premium of $3,703 on the Term Loan, and $844 of swap and
other breakage costs. 
As part of the acquisition of ATT, Griffon acquired interest rate swaps
that had fair values totaling $3,845 at September 30, 2010. These swaps were
terminated in October 2010 for $4,303, including accrued interest of $458. 
NOTE 11  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Griffon offers defined contribution plans to most of its U.S.
employees. In addition to employee contributions to the plans, Griffon makes
contributions based upon various percentages of compensation and/or employee
contributions, which were $7,300 in 2012, $7,500 in 2011 and $5,200 in 2010. 
The Company
also provides healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain groups of
retirees through several plans. For certain employees, the benefits are at
fixed amounts per retiree and are partially contributory by the retiree. The
post-retirement benefit obligation was $2,262 and $2,177 as of September 30,
2012 and 2011. The accumulated other comprehensive loss for these plans was
$79 and $78 as of September 30, for 2012 and 2011, respectively and the 2012
and 2011 benefit expense was $76 and $175, respectively. It is the Companys
practice to fund these benefits as incurred. 
76


GRIFFON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
Griffon also has qualified and non-qualified defined
    benefit plans covering certain employees with benefits based on years of
    service and employee compensation. Over time, these amounts will be recognized
    as part of net periodic pension costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Griffon is responsible for overseeing the management
    of the investments of the qualified defined benefit plan and uses the service
    of an investment manager to manage these assets based on agreed upon risk
    profiles set by Griffon management. The primary objective of the qualified
    defined benefit plan is to secure participant retirement benefits. As such,
    the key objective in this plans financial management is to promote
    stability and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status. Financial
    objectives are established in conjunction with a review of current and projected
    plan financial requirements. The fair value of a majority of the plan assets
    were determined by the plans trustee using quoted market prices for
    identical instruments (level 1 inputs) as of September 30, 2012. The fair
    value of various other investments were determined by the plans trustee
    using direct observable market corroborated inputs, including quoted market
    prices for similar assets (level 2 inputs). The fair value of investments
    with significant unobservable inputs was supported by audited financial statements
    (level 3 inputs). 
Effective
January 1, 2012, the Clopay Pension Plan merged with the Ames True Temper Inc.
Pension Plan. The merged qualified defined benefit plan was named the Clopay
Ames True Temper Plan (the CATT Plan). 
The Clopay portion of the CATT Plan has been frozen to new entrants
since December 2000. Certain employees who were part of the plan prior to
December 2000 continued to accrue a service benefit through December 2010, at
which time all plan participants stopped accruing service benefits. 
The ATT portion of the CATT Plan has been frozen
    to all new entrants since November 2009 and stopped accruing benefits in
    December 2009. 
The ATT supplemental executive retirement plan was frozen to new
entrants and participants in the plan stopped accruing benefits in 2008. 
Griffon uses judgment to estimate the assumptions used in determining
the future liability of the plan, as well as the investment returns on the
assets invested for the plan. The expected return on assets assumption used for
pension expense was developed through analysis of historical market returns,
current market conditions and the past experience of plan asset investments.
The discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on
high quality bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment
stream. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting
year-by-year spot rates. A 10% change in the discount rate, average wage
increase or return on assets would not have a material effect on the financial
statements of Griffon.

Griffon
expects to contribute $2,628 to the Defined Benefit plans in 2013, in addition
to the $3,951 in payments related to the Supplemental Benefits that will
primarily be funded from the general assets of Griffon. 
The CATT Plan
is covered by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Adjusted Funding Target
Attainment Percent (AFTAP) for the plan as of January 1, 2012 was 94.5%.
Since the plan was in excess of the 80% funding threshold there were no plan
restrictions. The expected level of 2013 catch up contributions is $2,802. 
The following
is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured
at fair value: 
Short-term investment funds
 The fair value is determined using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by
the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying
assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number
of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active
and is primarily classified as Level 2. These investments can be liquidated on
demand.

GRIFFON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
Government and agency securities
 When quoted market prices are available in an active market, the investments
are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available in an
active market, the investments are classified as Level 2. 
Equity Securities 
The fair values reflect the closing price reported on a major market where the
individual securities are traded. These investments are classified within Level
1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Debt securities 
The fair values are based on a compilation of primarily observable market
information or a broker quote in a non-active market. These investments are primarily
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Commingled funds 
The fair values are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the
fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the
trust/entity, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding. These investments are generally classified within Level 2 of the
valuation hierarchy and can be liquidated on demand. 
Interest in Limited Partnerships and Hedge
Funds - One limited partnership investment is a
private equity fund and the fair value is determined by the fund managers
based on the estimated value of the various holdings of the fund portfolio. One
of the commingled mutual funds is based on the value of the underlying assets
owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of
shares outstanding; these asset values are estimated by underlying managers of
the assets in which the fund invests. These investments are classified within
Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

Griffon has an ESOP that covers substantially all domestic employees.
All employees of Griffon, who are not members of a collective bargaining unit,
automatically become eligible to participate in the plan on the October 1st
following completion of one year of service. Griffons securities are allocated
to participants individual accounts based on the proportion of each
participants aggregate compensation (not to exceed $245 for the plan year
ended September 30, 2012), to the total of all participants
compensation. Shares of the ESOP which have been allocated to employee accounts
are charged to expense based on the fair value of the shares transferred and
are treated as outstanding in earnings per share. Compensation expense under
the ESOP was $1,796 in 2012, $841 in 2011 and $1,011 in 2010. The cost of the
shares held by the ESOP and not yet allocated to employees is reported as a
reduction of Shareholders Equity. The fair value of the unallocated ESOP
shares as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 based on the closing stock price of
Griffons stock was $21,993 and $19,761, respectively. The ESOP shares were as
follows:

Griffons income tax provision (benefit) included benefits of ($3,356)
in 2012, ($733) in 2011 and ($2,740) in 2010 reflecting the reversal of
previously recorded tax liabilities primarily due to the resolution of various
tax audits and due to the closing of certain statutes for prior years tax returns.

At September 30, 2011, other than for the ATT pre-acquisition unremitted foreign earnings,
and at September 30, 2012, Griffon has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
its non-U.S. subsidiaries because of managements ability and intent to
indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. At September 30, 2012,
Griffons share of the undistributed earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries
amounted to approximately $75,189. It is not practicable to estimate the amount
of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.
At September 30, 2011 deferred income taxes were recorded on
pre-acquisition undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for the ATT
group of entities. The deferred income taxes were recorded as these earnings
were historically not indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. At September
30, 2012 the pre-acquisition unremitted foreign earnings of ATT group were
distributed as a dividend to the U.S. Parent Corp. recognizing the previously
recorded deferred tax liability. 
At September 30, 2012 and 2011, Griffon had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal tax purposes of $0 and $51,000, respectively,
resulting from the acquisition of ATT and prior year U.S. losses, and had loss
carryforwards for non-U.S. tax purposes of $75,400 and $54,500, respectively.
The non-U.S. loss carryforwards are available for carryforward indefinitely.
Griffon had State and local loss carryforwards at September 30, 2012
and 2011 of $6,303 and $5,900, respectively, which expire in varying amounts
through 2032.
Griffon had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3,361 and $13,291 at
September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are available for use through
2017.
Griffon files U.S. Federal, state and local tax returns, as well as
Germany, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Australia, Mexico and Sweden non-U.S.
jurisdiction tax returns. Griffons U.S. Federal income tax returns are no
longer subject to income tax examination for years before 2006, the German
income tax returns are no longer subject to income tax examination for years
through 2007 and major U.S. state and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are no
longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2001. Various U.S.
state and non-U.S. statutory tax audits are currently underway.

If recognized, the amount of potential tax benefits
    that would impact Griffons effective tax rate is $8,605. Griffon recognizes
    potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
    in income tax expense. At September 30, 2012 and 2011, the combined amount
    of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken or to be
    taken on Griffons tax
returns and recorded as part of the reserves for uncertain tax positions was
$2,141 and $2,586, respectively. Griffon cannot reasonably estimate the extent
    to which existing liabilities for uncertain tax positions may increase or
    decrease within the next twelve months as a result of the progression of
    ongoing tax audits or other events. Griffon believes that it has adequately
    provided for all open tax years by tax jurisdiction.
NOTE
13  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND EQUITY COMPENSATION
On November 17, 2011, the Company began declaring quarterly dividends.
No cash dividends on Common Stock were declared or paid during the four years
ended September 30, 2011. During 2012, the Company declared and paid dividends
totaling $0.08 per share. The Company currently intends to pay dividends each
quarter; however, the payment of dividends is determined by the Board of
Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be
provided as to future dividends.
Compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over
the required service period based on the fair value of the grant calculated as
the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of
grant, and for performance shares, the likelihood of achieving the performance
criteria. Compensation cost related to stock-based awards with graded vesting
are amortized using the straight-line attribution method. 
In February 2011, shareholders approved the Griffon Corporation 2011
Equity Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) under which awards of performance
shares, performance units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
shares, deferred shares and other stock-based awards may be granted. Options
granted under the Incentive Plan may be either incentive stock options or
nonqualified stock options, generally expire ten years after the date of grant
and are granted at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market
value at the date of grant. The maximum number of shares of common stock
available for award under the Incentive Plan is 3,000,000 (600,000 of which may
be issued as incentive stock options) plus any shares underlying awards
outstanding on the effective date of the Incentive Plan under the 2006
Incentive Plan that are subsequently cancelled or forfeited. As of September
30, 2012, 1,802,159 shares were available for grant.

In August 2011, Griffons Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to $50,000 of Griffons outstanding common stock; this was in addition to
the 1,366,000 shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under an
existing buyback program. Under the repurchase programs, the Company may, from
time to time, purchase shares of its common stock, depending upon market
conditions, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, including

Operating leases




Griffon rents real property and equipment under
     operating leases expiring at various dates. Most of the real property leases
     have escalation clauses related to increases in real property taxes. Rent
     expense for all operating leases totaled approximately $30,598, $34,600
     and $25,100 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Aggregate future minimum
     lease payments for operating leases at September 30, 2012 are $22,345 in
     2013, $17,098 in 2014, $14,477 in 2015, $11,647 in 2016, $8,733 in 2017
     and $15,082 thereafter.



Legal and
environmental
Department of Environmental Conservation of
New York State (DEC), with ISC Properties, Inc. Lightron
Corporation (Lightron), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Griffon, once conducted
operations at a location in Peekskill in the Town of Cortlandt, New York (the
Peekskill Site) owned by ISC Properties, Inc. (ISC), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Griffon. ISC sold the Peekskill Site in November 1982. 
Subsequently, Griffon was advised by the DEC
that random sampling at the Peekskill Site and in a creek near the Peekskill
Site indicated concentrations of solvents and other chemicals common to
Lightrons prior plating operations. ISC then entered into a consent order with
the DEC in 1996 (the Consent Order) to perform a remedial investigation and
prepare a feasibility study. After completing the initial remedial
investigation pursuant to the Consent Order, ISC was required by the DEC, and
did conduct accordingly over the next several years, supplemental remedial
investigations, including soil vapor investigations, under the Consent Order. 
89


GRIFFON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
(US dollars and non US currencies in thousands, except per share data)
In April 2009, the DEC advised ISCs representatives that both the DEC
and the New York State Department of Health had reviewed and accepted an August
2007 Remedial Investigation Report and an Additional Data Collection Summary
Report dated January 30, 2009. With the acceptance of these
reports, ISC completed the remedial investigation required under the
Consent Order and was authorized, accordingly, by the DEC to conduct the
Feasibility Study required by the Consent Order. Pursuant to the requirements
of the Consent Order and its obligations thereunder, ISC, without acknowledging
any responsibility to perform any remediation at the Site, submitted to the DEC
in August 2009, a draft feasibility study which recommended for the soil,
groundwater and sediment medias, remediation alternatives having a current net
capital cost value, in the aggregate, of approximately $5,000. In February
2011, DEC advised ISC it has accepted and approved the feasibility study.
Accordingly, ISC has no further obligations under the consent order. 
Upon acceptance of the feasibility study, DEC issued a Proposed
Remedial Action Plan (PRAP) that sets forth the proposed remedy for the site.
The PRAP accepted the recommendation contained in the feasibility study for
remediation of the soil and groundwater medias, but selected a different
remediation alternative for the sediment medium. The approximate cost and the
current net capital cost value of the remedy proposed by DEC in the PRAP is
approximately $10,000. After receiving public comments on the PRAP, the DEC
issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that set forth the specific remedies
selected and responded to public comments. The remedies selected by the DEC in
the ROD are the same remedies as those set forth in the PRAP. 
It is now expected that DEC will enter into negotiations with
potentially responsible parties to request they undertake performance of the
remedies selected in the ROD, and if such parties do not agree to implement
such remedies, then the State may use State Superfund money to remediate the
Peekskill site and seek recovery of costs from such parties. Griffon does not
acknowledge any responsibility to perform any remediation at the Peekskill
Site. 
Improper Advertisement Claim involving Union
Tools Products. Since December 2004, a customer of ATT
has been named in various litigation matters relating to certain Union Tools
products. The plaintiffs in those litigation matters have asserted causes of
action against the customer of ATT for improper advertisement to end consumers.
The allegations suggest that advertisements led the consumers to believe that
Union Tools hand tools were wholly manufactured within boundaries of the
United States. The complaints assert various causes of action against the
customer of ATT under federal and state law, including common law fraud. At
some point, likely once the litigation against the customer of ATT ends, the
customer may seek indemnity (including recovery of its legal fees and costs)
against ATT for an unspecified amount. Presently, ATT cannot estimate the
amount of loss, if any, if the customer were to seek legal recourse against
ATT. 
Department of Environmental Conservation of
New York State, regarding Frankfort, NY site. During
fiscal 2009, an underground fuel tank with surrounding soil contamination was
discovered at the Frankfort, N.Y. site which is the result of historical
facility operations prior to ATTs ownership. While ATT was actively working
with the DEC and the New York State Department of Health to define remediation
requirements relative to the underground fuel tank, the DEC took the position
that ATT was responsible to remediate other types of contamination on the site.
After negotiations with the DEC, on August 15, 2011, ATT executed an Order on
Consent with the DEC. The Order is without admission or finding of liability or
acknowledgement that there has been a release of hazardous substances at the
site. Importantly, the Order does not waive any rights that ATT has under a
1991 Consent Judgment entered into between the DEC and a predecessor of ATT
relating to the site. The Order requires that ATT identify Areas of Concern at
the site, and formulate a strategy to investigate and remedy both on and off
site conditions in compliance with applicable environmental law. At the
conclusion of the remedy phase of the remediation to the satisfaction of the
DEC, the DEC will issue a Certificate of Completion. On August 1, 2012 a fire
occurred during the course of demolition of certain structures at the
Frankfort, NY site. The fire caused extensive damage requiring additional
remediation under the oversight of DEC. The
insurance carrier for the demolition contractor has responded and has
committed to funding the cost of remediation and clean up resulting from the
fire. The cleanup is ongoing.

U.S. Government investigations and claims
Defense contracts and subcontracts, including Griffons contracts and
subcontracts, are subject to audit and review by various agencies and
instrumentalities of the United States government, including among others, the
Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Investigative
Service (DCIS), and the Department of Justice which has responsibility for
asserting claims on behalf of the U.S. government. In addition to ongoing audits,
pursuant to an administrative subpoena Griffon is currently providing
information to the U.S. Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General.
No claim has been asserted against Griffon, and Griffon is unaware of any
material financial exposure in connection with the Inspector Generals inquiry.

In general, departments and agencies of the U.S. Government have the
authority to investigate various transactions and operations of Griffon, and
the results of such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be fines, penalties,
repayments or compensatory or treble damages. U.S. Government regulations
provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export
privileges for a company or an operating division or subdivision. Suspension or
debarment could have material adverse effect on Telephonics because of its
reliance on government contracts. 
General legal
Griffon is subject to various laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment and is a party to legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on facts presently
known to it, that the resolution of the matters above and such other matters
will not have a material adverse effect on Griffons consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 9.        Changes
in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
          Not
applicable. 
Item 9A.     Controls
and Procedures
Evaluation and Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 
Griffons management, with the participation of its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Griffons disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Griffons
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Griffon in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms and such information is
accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 
Griffons management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Griffons internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
Griffons financial statements for external reporting in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management evaluates the effectiveness of Griffons internal control over
financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of
Griffons Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the
effectiveness of Griffons internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2012 and concluded that it is effective. 
Griffons independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton
LLP, has audited the effectiveness of Griffons internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2012, and has expressed an unqualified opinion in
their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Changes in Internal Controls 
There were no changes in Griffons internal control over financial
reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that
occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2012 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrants internal control over financial reporting. 
105


Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness
Controls 



 


 


 




Griffons
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Griffons internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:




 


(i)


pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of Griffons assets;




 


(ii)


provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that Griffons receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of Griffons management and
directors; and




 


(iii)


provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Griffons assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. 



Management, including Griffons Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that Griffons internal controls will
prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation
of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that
those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
