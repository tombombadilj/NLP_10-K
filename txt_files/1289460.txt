risks associated with partnering with franchisees or other investment partners in markets with whom we have no prior
history and whose interests may not align with ours; 
the rate of growth of general and administrative expenses associated with building a strengthened corporate infrastructure
to support our growth initiatives; 
negative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns and other food or beverage related matters;  
our franchisees' adherence to our practices, policies and procedures;

 PART I  
 
   ITEM 1BUSINESS     
        Texas Roadhouse, Inc. ("Texas Roadhouse" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2004. The
principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky. 
 General Development of Business  
        Texas Roadhouse is a growing, moderately priced, full-service, casual dining restaurant chain. Our founder, chairman and
chief executive officer ("CEO"), W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 365 restaurants in 47
states. In addition, we opened our first international franchise-owned Texas Roadhouse in Dubai, UAE in 2011. Our mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service®." Our operating
strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants as the local hometown destination for a broad segment
of consumers seeking high quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 27, 2011, we owned and operated 294 restaurants and franchised or licensed an
additional 72 restaurants. Of the 294 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2011, 291 operated as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, while three operated under the name of Aspen Creek. All of our
planned restaurant growth in 2012 will be Texas Roadhouse restaurants. 
 Financial Information about Operating Segments  
        We consider our restaurant and franchising operations as similar and have aggregated them into a single reportable segment. The
majority of the restaurants operate in the U.S. within the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, providing similar products to similar customers. The restaurants also possess similar
pricing structures, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. We operate each of our 294 company-owned restaurants as a single operating segment. 
 Narrative Description of Business  
        Texas Roadhouse is a full-service, casual dining restaurant chain. We offer an assortment of specially seasoned and aged
steaks hand-cut daily on the premises and cooked to order over open gas-fired grills. In addition to steaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, fish, seafood,
chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority of our entrées include two
made-from-scratch side items, and we offer all our guests a free unlimited supply of roasted in-shell peanuts and made-from-scratch yeast
rolls. 
4



 
Table of Contents
        The
operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concept is built on the following key components: 


Offering high quality, freshly prepared food.  We place a
great deal of emphasis on ensuring our guests receive high quality, freshly prepared food. We hand-cut almost all of our steaks and make all of our sides from scratch. As part of our
process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée
before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest's order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose function
is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of assuring uniform adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards,
food appearance, freshness and portion size.   
Offering performance-based manager compensation.  We offer
a performance-based compensation program to our individual restaurant managers and multi-restaurant supervisors, who are called "managing partners" and "market partners," respectively. Each of these
partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant's pre-tax net income. By providing our partners with a
significant stake in the success of our restaurants, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners.  
Focusing on dinner.  In a high percentage of our
restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays. By focusing on dinner, our restaurant teams have to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week. We
believe this allows our restaurant teams to offer higher quality, more consistent food and service to our guests. In addition, we believe the dinner focus provides a better
"quality-of-life" for our management teams and, therefore, is a key ingredient in attracting and retaining talented and experienced management personnel. We also focus on
keeping our table-to-server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus on their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner.  
Offering attractive price points.  We offer our food and
beverages at moderate price points that are as low as or lower than those offered by many of our competitors. Within each menu category, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of
fulfilling each guest's budget and value expectations. For example, our steak entrées, which include the choice of two side items, generally range from $9.49 for our 6-ounce
sirloin to $24.99 for our 23 oz. Porterhouse T-bone, which is currently available in approximately one-third of our restaurants. The per guest average check for the Texas
Roadhouse restaurants we owned and operated in 2011 was $14.89. Per guest average check represents restaurant sales divided by the number of guests served. We considered each sale of an
entrée to be a single guest served. Our per guest average check is higher as a result of our weekday dinner only focus.   
Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere.  We believe the
atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. Our restaurants feature a rustic southwestern lodge décor accentuated with
hand-painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, we offer jukeboxes, which continuously play upbeat country hits, and in-house
entertainment such as line dancing and birthday celebrations. 

 Unit Prototype and Economics  
        We design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on restaurant-level returns
over time. Our current prototypical restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 6,679 to 7,079 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.7 to 2.0 acres or
retail pad sites, with seating of approximately 57 to 64 tables for a 
5



 
Table of Contents
total
of 245 to 281 guests, including 15 bar seats, and parking for approximately 160 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross parking
arrangement. Our current prototypes are adaptable to in-line and end cap locations such as spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping center. 
        As
of December 27, 2011, we leased173 properties and owned 121 properties. Our 2011 average unit volume was $3.9 million, which represents restaurant sales for all Texas
Roadhouse company restaurants open before June 28, 2011. The time required for a new restaurant to reach a steady level of cash flow is approximately three to six months. Our capital investment
(including cash and non-cash costs) for new restaurants varies significantly depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the square footage, layout, scope of any
required site work, type of construction labor (union or non-union), local permitting requirements, our ability to negotiate with landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and
hook-up fees and geographical location. For 2011, the average capital investment for Texas Roadhouse restaurants developed was $3.76 million, broken down as follows:

Our
2011 average capital investment for restaurants developed was $3.76 million compared to our 2010 average of $3.74 million. Our 2010 average capital investment for restaurants
developed was $0.34 million lower compared to our 2009 average of $4.08 million, primarily due to building design modifications and lower site work costs. 
 Site Selection  
        We continue to develop and refine our site selection process. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team, including our
restaurant market partners, devotes significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density, household income levels and site-specific
characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic
generators, proximity of other retail activities, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with real estate brokers in target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly
update our database of potential sites. We typically require three to six months to locate, approve and control a restaurant site and typically four to eight additional months to obtain necessary
permits. Upon receipt of permits, it requires approximately four months to construct, equip and open a restaurant.

 Food  
        Menu.    Texas Roadhouse restaurants offer a wide variety of menu items at attractive prices that are designed to appeal to a broad range
of consumer
tastes. Our dinner entrée prices generally range from $8.99 to $24.99, with about 15 entrées priced under $10.00. We offer a broad assortment of specially seasoned and
aged steaks, including 6, 8, 11 and 16 oz. Sirloins; 10, 12, 16 and 20 oz. Rib-eyes; 6 and 8 oz. Filets; Prime Rib; and T-Bones, almost all of which are hand-cut
daily on the premises and cooked over open gas-fired grills. We also offer our guests a selection of fish, seafood, chicken, pork chops, ribs, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an
assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. Entrée prices include made-from-scratch yeast rolls and most include the choice of two of the following
made-from-scratch sides: baked potato, sweet potato, steak fries, mashed potatoes, house or Caesar salad, green beans, chili, seasoned rice, baked beans, corn and steamed
vegetables. Our menu allows guests to customize their meals by ordering steaks that are "smothered" either in cheese, onions, gravy or mushrooms and baked potatoes "loaded" with sour cream, cheese,
bacon and butter. Other menu items include specialty appetizers such as the "Cactus Blossom®" and "Chicken Critters®" (chicken tenders). We also provide a "12 & Under"
menu for children that includes sirloin steak, rib basket, Lil 'Dillo Sirloin Bites, Jr. Chicken Critters, mini-cheeseburgers, hot dog and macaroni and cheese, all served with one side
item and a beverage at prices generally between $2.99 and $7.99. 
        Most
of our restaurants feature a full bar that offers an extensive selection of draft and bottled beer. Managing partners are encouraged to tailor their beer selection to include
regional and local brands. We serve a selection of major brands of liquor and wine as well as margaritas. Alcoholic beverages accounted for 10.7% of restaurant sales at Texas Roadhouse in fiscal 2011. 
        We
have maintained a fairly consistent menu over time, with a selection of approximately 60 entrees and 90 total menu items. We continually review our menu to consider enhancements to
existing menu items or the introduction of new items. We change our menu only after guest feedback and an extensive study of the operational and economic implications. To maintain our high levels of
food quality and service, we generally remove one menu item for every new menu item introduced so as to facilitate our ability to execute high quality meals on a focused range of menu items. 
         Food Quality and Safety.    We are committed to serving a varied menu of high-quality, great tasting food items with an emphasis on
freshness. We have developed proprietary recipes to ensure consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants and provide a unique flavor experience to our guests. At each restaurant, a fully
trained meat cutter hand cuts our steaks and other restaurant team members prepare all side items and yeast rolls from scratch in the restaurants daily. We assign individual kitchen employees to the
preparation of designated food items in order to focus on quality, consistency and speed. Additionally, we expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves
the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest's order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. 
        We
employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to the kitchen staff in all Texas Roadhouse restaurants for the
purpose of reinforcing the uniformity of recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. The team currently consists of over 35 product
coaches, supporting all Texas Roadhouse restaurants system-wide. 
        Food
safety is of utmost importance to us. We currently utilize several programs to help ensure adherence to proper food preparation procedures and food safety standards. We have a
Product Quality team whose function, in conjunction with our product coaches, is to develop, enforce and maintain programs designed to promote compliance with food safety guidelines. Where required,
food items purchased from qualified vendors have been inspected by reputable, outside inspection services confirming that the vendor is compliant with FDA and USDA guidelines.

Table of Contents
        We
perform sanitation audits on each restaurant four times a year and these results are reviewed by various members of operations and management. To reinforce the importance of food
safety, we have printed all HAACP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Points) in bold type on each recipe. In addition, most of our product coaches have obtained or are in the process of obtaining their
food safety professional designation. 
        Purchasing.    Our purchasing philosophy is designed to consistently supply fresh, quality products to the restaurants at competitive
prices while
maximizing operating efficiencies. We negotiate directly with suppliers for substantially all food and beverage products to ensure consistent quality and freshness and obtain competitive prices.
Certain products, such as dairy products and select produce, are purchased locally to assure freshness. 
        Food
and supplies are ordered by, and shipped directly to, the restaurants, as we do not maintain a central product warehouse or commissary. Most food products used in the operation of
our restaurants are distributed to individual restaurants through an independent national distribution company. We strive to qualify more than one supplier for all key food items and believe that beef
of comparable quality as well as all other essential food and beverage products are available, upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers.

         Guest Satisfaction.    We believe that guest satisfaction and our ability to continually evaluate and improve the guest experience at each
of our
restaurants is important to our success. Through the use of guest surveys, our website "texasroadhouse.com," a toll-free guest response telephone line and personal interaction in the
restaurant, we receive valuable feedback from guests. Additionally, we employ an outside service to administer a "Secret Shopper" program whereby trained individuals periodically dine and
comprehensively evaluate the guest experience at each of our restaurants. Particular attention is given to food, beverage and service quality, cleanliness, staff attitude and teamwork, and manager
visibility and interaction. The resulting reports are used for follow up training feedback to both staff and management. We continue to evaluate and implement processes relating to guest satisfaction,
including reducing guest wait times and improving host interaction with the guest. 
        Atmosphere.    The atmosphere of Texas Roadhouse restaurants is intended to appeal to broad segments of the population, children, families,
couples,
adults and business persons. Substantially all Texas Roadhouse restaurants are of our prototype design, reflecting a rustic southwestern lodge atmosphere, featuring an exterior of
rough-hewn cedar siding and corrugated metal. The interiors feature pine floors and stained concrete and are decorated with hand-painted murals, neon signs, southwestern
prints, rugs and artifacts. The restaurants contain jukeboxes that continuously play upbeat country hits. Guests may also view a display-baking area where our made-from-scratch
yeast rolls are prepared and a meat cooler displaying
fresh cut steaks, and may wait for seating in either a spacious, comfortable waiting area or a southwestern style bar. While waiting for a table, guests can enjoy complimentary roasted
in-shell peanuts. Immediately upon being seated at a table, guests can enjoy made-from-scratch yeast rolls along with roasted in-shell peanuts. 
 People  
         Management and Employees.    Each of our restaurants is generally staffed with one managing partner, one kitchen manager and one service
manager, and,
in most cases, one or more additional assistant managers and/or key employees. Managing partners are single restaurant operators who have primary responsibility for the
day-to-day operations of the entire restaurant and are responsible for maintaining the standards of quality and performance we establish. We use market partners to supervise
the operation of our restaurants including the continuing development of each restaurant's management team. Market partners also assist in the new restaurant site selection process. Generally, 
9



 
Table of Contents
each
market partner has supervisory responsibilities for up to 8 to 13 restaurants. Through regular visits to the restaurants, the market partners ensure adherence to all aspects of our concept,
strategy and standards of quality. To further assure adherence to our standards of quality and to achieve uniform execution throughout the system, we employ product coaches who regularly visit the
restaurants to assist in training of both new and existing employees and to grade food quality. The attentive service and high quality food, which results from each restaurant having a managing
partner, two to three managers and the hands-on assistance of a product coach, are critical to our success. 
        Training and Development.    All restaurant employees are required to complete varying degrees of training before and during employment.
Our detailed
training program emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and standards and is conducted individually at Texas Roadhouse restaurants and in groups in Louisville, Kentucky. 
        Our
managing and market partners are generally required to have significant experience in the full-service restaurant industry and are generally hired at a minimum of nine to
12 months before their placement in a new or existing restaurant to allow time to fully train in all aspects of restaurant operations. All managing partners, kitchen and service managers and
other management team members are required to complete a comprehensive training program of up to 17 weeks, which includes training for every position in the restaurant. Trainees are validated
at pre-determined points during their training by either the market partner, product coach or a training manager. 
        A
number of our restaurants have been certified as training centers by our training department. This certification confirms that the training center adheres to established operating
procedures and guidelines. Additionally, most restaurants are staffed with training coordinators responsible for ongoing daily training needs. 
        For
new restaurant openings, a full team of designated trainers, each specializing in a specific restaurant position, is deployed to the restaurant at least ten days before opening.
Formal employee training begins seven days before opening, and follows a uniform, comprehensive training course as directed by a training manager. 
 Marketing  
        Our marketing strategy aims to promote the Texas Roadhouse brand, while retaining a localized focus,
to:


increase comparable restaurant sales by increasing the frequency of visits by our current guests and attracting new guests
to our restaurants; 
support new restaurant openings to achieve restaurant sales and operating margin goals; and  
communicate and promote our brand's food quality, the guest experience and value. 

        We
accomplish these objectives through three major initiatives. 
        In-restaurant Marketing.    A significant portion of our marketing fund is spent in communicating with our guests while they are in our
restaurants through point of purchase materials. We believe special promotions such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day drive significant repeat business. Also, our eight week holiday gift card
campaign is one of our most significant promotions. In addition, our mascot, "Andy Armadillo®", provides our guests with a familiar and easily identifiable face.

Table of Contents 
         Local Restaurant Area Marketing.    Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, local area marketing is integral in developing
brand awareness
in each market. To enhance our visibility in new markets, we deliver free food to local businesses in connection with new restaurant openings and on an ongoing basis to drive awareness. Managing
partners are encouraged to participate in creative community-based marketing, such as hosting local radio or television programs. We also engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as
contributing time, money and complimentary meals to charitable, civic and cultural programs. For instance, our involvement with the Special Olympics, a local Little League baseball team, a local
church or the Armed Forces, shows our "Legendary Care, Concern and Support" for our communities. We leverage the corresponding recognition in our public relations and marketing efforts to communicate
our corporate values and mission statement to our guests. We employ marketing coordinators at the restaurant and market level to develop and execute the majority of the local marketing strategies. 
        Advertising.    Our restaurant concept does not rely on national advertising to promote the brand. We utilize public relations to generate
"earned
media" story placement in local, regional and national media. Our concept also uses a permission-based e-mail loyalty program to promote our brand and our growing social media strategy
provides us the opportunity to frequently communicate with our guests. This approach aligns with our focus on local store marketing and community involvement. 
 Restaurant Franchise Arrangements  
        Franchise Restaurants.    As of December 27, 2011, we had 19 franchisees that operated 72 restaurants in 24 states and one
foreign
country. Franchise rights are granted for specific restaurants only, as we have not granted any rights to develop a territory in the United States. Approximately 75% of our franchise restaurants are
operated by eight franchisees. No franchisee operates more than 16 restaurants. 
        Our
standard domestic franchise agreement has a term of ten years with two renewal options for an additional five years each if certain conditions are satisfied. Our current form of
franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 4.0% of gross sales. The royalty fee varies depending on when the agreements were entered into and range from 2.0% of gross sales to
the current 4.0% fee. We may, at our discretion, waive or reduce the royalty fee on a temporary or permanent basis. "Gross sales" means the total selling price of all services and products related to
the restaurant. Gross sales do not include:


employee discounts or other discounts; 
tips or gratuities paid directly to employees by guests; 
any federal, state, municipal or other sales, value added or retailer's excise taxes; or  
adjustments for net returns on salable goods and discounts allowed to guests on sales. 

        Domestic
franchisees are currently required to pay 0.3% of gross sales to a national advertising and marketing fund for the development of advertising materials, system-wide
promotions and related marketing efforts. We have the ability under our agreements to increase the required national advertising and marketing fund contribution up to 2.5% of gross sales. We may also
charge a marketing fee of 0.5% of gross sales, which we may use for market research and to develop system-wide promotional and advertising materials. A franchisee's total required
advertising contribution or spending will not be more than 3.0% of gross sales. 
        Our
standard domestic franchise agreement gives us the right, but not the obligation, to compel a franchisee to transfer its assets to us in exchange for shares of our stock, or to
convert its equity interests into shares of our stock. The amount of shares that a franchisee would receive is based on a formula that is included in the franchise agreement. 
11



 
Table of Contents
        We
have entered into one area development and franchise agreement for the development of restaurants in eight countries in the Middle East over ten years. Our franchisee is required to
pay us a franchise fee for each restaurant to be opened, royalties on the gross sales of each restaurant and a development fee for our grant of development rights in the named countries. The term of
the agreement may be extended, and the franchisee has rights to expand into additional countries. We anticipate that the specific business terms of any future franchise agreement for international
restaurants might vary significantly from the standard terms of our domestic agreements and from the terms of the single existing international agreement, depending on the territory to be franchised
and the extent of franchisor-provided services to each franchisee. 
        Any
of our franchise agreements, whether domestic or international, may be terminated if the franchisee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the franchise
agreement, including its obligations to operate the restaurant in strict accordance with our standards and specifications. A franchise agreement may also be terminated if a franchisee becomes
insolvent, fails to make its required payments, creates a threat to the public health or safety, ceases to operate the restaurant, or misuses the Texas Roadhouse trademarks. 
        Franchise Compliance Assurance.    We have various systems in place to promote compliance with our systems and standards, both during the
development
and operating of franchise restaurants. We actively work with our franchisees to support successful franchise operations as well as compliance with the Texas Roadhouse standards and procedures. During
the restaurant development phase, we approve the selection of restaurant sites and make available copies of our prototype building plans to franchisees. In addition, we ensure that the building design
is in compliance with our standards. We provide training to
the managing partner and up to three other managers of a franchisee's first restaurant. We also provide trainers to assist in the opening of every domestic franchise restaurant; we provide trainers to
assist our international franchisees in the opening of their restaurants until such time as they develop an approved restaurant opening training program. Finally, on an ongoing basis, we conduct
reviews on all franchise restaurants to determine their level of effectiveness in executing our concept at a variety of operational levels. Our franchisees are required to follow the same standards
and procedures regarding equipment, food purchases and food preparation as we maintain in our company restaurants. Reviews are conducted by seasoned operations teams, and focus on key areas including
health, safety and execution proficiency. 
        To
continuously improve our communications with franchisees and the consistency of the brand, we maintain a business development council that includes representatives of our domestic
franchisees, company operations personnel and vendors. The council's functions are advisory. Its members review and comment on proposed advertising campaigns and materials and budget expenditures, as
well as operational initiatives. Our regional market partners also provide support to our domestic franchise restaurant operators. 
         Management Services.    We provide management services to 22 of the franchise restaurants in which we and/or our founder have an ownership
interest.
Such management services include accounting, operational supervision, human resources, training, and food, beverage and equipment consulting for which we receive monthly fees of up to 2.5% of gross
sales. We also make available to these restaurants certain legal services through outside sources and restaurant employees and employee benefits on a pass-through cost basis. In addition,
we receive a monthly fee from four franchise restaurants for providing payroll and accounting services. 
 Management Information Systems and Restaurant Reporting  
        All of our company restaurants utilize computerized management information systems, which are designed to improve operating
efficiencies, provide restaurant and Support Center management with timely access to financial and operating data and reduce administrative time and expense. With our 
12



 
Table of Contents
current
information systems, we have the ability to query, report and analyze this intelligent data on a daily, weekly, period, quarter and year-to-date basis and beyond, on a
company-wide, regional or individual restaurant basis. Together, this enables us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs and labor and operating expenses at each of our
restaurants. We have a number of systems and reports that provide comparative information that enables both restaurant and Support Center management to supervise the financial and operational
performance of our restaurants and to recognize and understand trends in the business. Our accounting department uses a standard, integrated system to prepare monthly profit and loss statements, which
provides a detailed analysis of sales and costs. These monthly profit and loss statements are compared both to the restaurant-prepared reports and to prior periods. Currently, we utilize cable,
digital subscriber lines (DSL) or T-1 technology at the restaurant level, which serves as a high-speed, secure communication link between the restaurants and our Support Center
as well as our credit and gift card processor. 
 Competition  
        According to the National Restaurant Association, or NRA, restaurant industry sales in 2012 will represent approximately 4% of the
United States' gross domestic product. The NRA also forecasts that restaurant industry sales will reach $632 billion in 2012 and will encompass approximately 970,000 restaurants. 
        Competition
in the restaurant industry is intense. Texas Roadhouse restaurants compete with mid-priced, full-service, casual dining restaurants primarily on the
basis of taste, quality and price of the food offered, service, atmosphere, location and overall dining experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurants that range from
independent local operators to well-capitalized national restaurant chains. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of the above factors, other restaurants
operate with concepts that compete for the same casual dining guests as we do. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for quality site locations and restaurant-level
employees. 
 Trademarks  
        Our registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our trade names and our stylized logos. We have registered all of
our significant marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered or have registrations pending for our most significant trademarks and service marks in 23 foreign
jurisdictions including the European Union. To better protect our brand, we have also registered various Internet domain names. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary
rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. 
 Government Regulation  
        We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws. Each of our restaurants is subject to permitting, licensing and
regulation by a number of government authorities relating to alcoholic beverage control, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire codes, and to compliance with the applicable zoning, land use and
environmental laws and regulations. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. 
        In
2011, the sale of alcoholic beverages accounted for 10.7% of our restaurant sales. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority
and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities, for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations
affect numerous aspects of restaurant operations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, 
13



 
Table of Contents
advertising,
wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. 
        The
failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would have a material adverse effect on the restaurant's operations. To reduce this risk, each company
restaurant is operated in accordance with procedures intended to assure compliance with applicable codes and regulations. 
        We
are subject in certain states to "dram shop" statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that
wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as excess umbrella
coverage of $100.0 million, with a $10,000 deductible for the first $25.0 million of excess coverage. 
        Our
restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as the minimum hourly wage, minimum tipped wage, unemployment tax rates, sales tax and similar
matters, over which we have no control. Significant numbers of our service, food preparation and other personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage (which currently is $7.25 per
hour) or federal tipped wage (which currently is $2.13 per hour). In addition, numerous states in which we operate have passed legislation governing the applicable state minimum hourly and/or tipped
wage.
Further planned and unplanned increases in federal and/or state minimum hourly and tipped wages or state unemployment tax rates will increase our labor costs. 
 Seasonality  
        Our business is subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the
winter months of each year. 
 Employees  
        As of December 27, 2011, we employed approximately 33,000 people, of whom 393 were executive and administrative personnel, 1,330
were restaurant management personnel and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Many of our hourly restaurant employees work part-time. None of our employees are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

  Risks Related to Our Business     
 If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it could harm our business.  
        Failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business. We have grown significantly since our inception and intend to
continue growing in the future. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability
to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management
and on our existing infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted. 
 You should not rely on past changes in our average unit volumes or our comparable restaurant sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they may
fluctuate significantly.  
        A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales,
including, among other factors:


our ability to execute our business strategy effectively; 
unusually strong initial sales performance by new restaurants; 
competition; 
weather and acts of God; 
consumer trends; 
introduction of new menu items; and 
general regional, national and global economic conditions. 

        Our
average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales may not increase at rates achieved in the past. Changes in our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales could cause
the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. 
 Our growth strategy, which primarily depends on our ability to open new restaurants that are profitable, is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.  
        Our objective is to grow our business and increase stockholder value by (1) expanding our base of company restaurants (and, to a
lesser extent, franchise restaurants) that are profitable and (2) increasing sales and profits at existing restaurants. While both these methods of achieving our objective are important to us,
historically the most significant means of achieving our objective has been through opening new restaurants and operating these restaurants on a profitable basis. We expect this to continue to be the
case in the future. 
        We
cannot assure you that we will be able to open new restaurants in accordance with our expansion plans. We have experienced delays in opening some of our restaurants in the past and
may experience delays in the future. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our growth strategy. One of our biggest challenges in executing our growth strategy
is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for suitable restaurant sites in our target markets is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able
to find sufficient suitable locations, or suitable purchase or lease terms, for our planned expansion in any future period. 
16



 
Table of Contents
Our
ability to open new restaurants will also depend on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the
following:


our ability to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel, especially market partners and managing partners;  
the availability of construction materials and labor; 
our ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants;  
our ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all;  
our ability to secure liquor licenses; 
general economic conditions; 
the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses; and  
weather and acts of God. 

        Once
opened, we anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months to reach planned operating levels due to start-up inefficiencies typically associated
with new restaurants. We cannot assure you that any restaurant we open will be profitable or obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Our ability to operate new
restaurants profitably will depend on numerous factors, including those discussed above impacting our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales, some of which are beyond our control,
including, but not limited to, the following:


competition; 
consumer acceptance of our restaurants in new domestic or international markets;  
the ability of the market partner and the managing partner to execute our business strategy at the new restaurant;  
general regional, national and global economic conditions; 
changes in government regulation; 
road construction and other factors limiting access to the restaurant; and  
weather and acts of God. 

        Our
failure to successfully open new restaurants that are profitable in accordance with our growth strategy could harm our business and future prospects. 
 Our objective to increase sales and profits at existing restaurants could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions.  
        During 2012 and possibly beyond, the U.S. and global economies may continue to suffer from a downturn in economic activity.
Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher
tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits could adversely affect the demand for our products. As in the past, we could
experience reduced guest traffic or we may be unable or unwilling to increase the prices we can charge for our products to offset higher costs or fewer transactions, either of which could reduce our
sales and profit margins. Also, landlords or other
tenants in the shopping centers in which some of our restaurants are located may experience difficulty as a result of macroeconomic trends or cease to operate, which could in turn negatively affect
guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
17



 
Table of Contents
 Our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.  
        Our franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with Texas Roadhouse standards. We also provide
training and support to franchisees. However, most franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and these franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their
restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our
standards, the Texas Roadhouse image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors, some of
which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.  
        Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors,
including:


the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses; 
restaurant operating costs for our newly-opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several
months of operation than thereafter; 
labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel including mandated changes in federal and/or state
minimum and tip wage rates, state unemployment tax rates, or health benefits; 
profitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets; 
changes in interest rates; 
increases and decreases in average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales;  
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and any loss on restaurant closures;  
general economic conditions, globally, nationally and locally; 
negative publicity relating to the consumption of beef or other products we serve;  
changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions; 
expansion to new domestic or international markets; 
adverse weather conditions which impact guest traffic at our restaurants;  
increases in infrastructure costs; 
fluctuations in commodity prices; 
competitive actions; and 
weather and acts of God. 

        Our
business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. As a result, our
quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities
analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. 
18



 
Table of Contents
 If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.  
        Our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel, particularly our
executive officers. Our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and
managers, particularly regional market partners, market partners and managing partners. Competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or
other key officers or managers or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business. 
 Our failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.  
        We own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations,
including our trade names and logos, and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and
our competitive position. We, therefore, devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. The protective actions that we take, however, may not be enough to
prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal
fees. Our inability to register or protect our marks and other propriety rights in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our competitive position in international markets. 
        We
cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such
claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 We may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms.  
        The development of our business may require significant additional capital in the future to, among other things, fund our operations
and growth strategy. We may rely on bank financing and also may seek access to the debt and/or equity capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing will be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor
sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional
financings unattractive to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded. 
 Our existing credit facility limits our ability to incur additional debt.  
        The lenders' obligation to extend credit under the facility depends on our maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum
consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. If we are unable to maintain these ratios, we would be unable to obtain additional
financing under this facility. The credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the facility, except for the incurrence of secured indebtedness that in the
aggregate exceeds 20% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured indebtedness would prevent us from complying with our financial covenants. 
        We
have also entered into other loan agreements with other lenders to finance various restaurants which impose financial covenants that are less restrictive than those imposed by our
existing credit facility. A default under these loan agreements could result in a default under our existing credit facility, which in turn would limit our ability to secure additional funds under
that facility. As of December 27, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our lenders' covenants.

 We may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future.  
        In accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain estimates and
projections with regard to company-owned restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. When impairment
triggers are deemed to exist for any given company-owned restaurant, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant are compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value
materially exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. 
        We
also review the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or other
intangible assets may exceed the fair value of such assets. The estimates of fair value are based upon the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management
assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation measurements and techniques. 
        The
estimates of fair value used in these analyses require the use of judgment, certain assumptions and estimates of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates
or assumptions, additional impairment charges may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 The acquisition of existing restaurants from our franchisees and licensees and other strategic transactions may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business
and our financial condition.  
        We plan to opportunistically acquire existing restaurants from our franchisees or licensees over time. Additionally, from time to time,
we evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts. To successfully execute any acquisition or development strategy,
we will need to identify suitable acquisition or development candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any acquisition or future development
that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:


material adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the
acquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations; 
risks associated with entering into new domestic or international markets or conducting operations where we have no or
limited prior experience; 
risks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other
liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, and our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and 
the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. 

        Future
acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees or licensees or other strategic partners, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of
shares of common stock or a combination of both, could have a dilutive impact on holders of our common stock, and result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges
related to goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. The development of additional concepts and/or the entrance into
international markets may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas Roadhouse concept domestically. Development rates for newer brands may differ significantly as there is
increased risk in the development of a new restaurant concept or system.

Table of Contents
 Approximately 16.7% of our company restaurants are located in Texas and, as a result, we are sensitive to economic and other trends and developments in that state.  
        As of December 27, 2011, we operated a total of 49 company restaurants in Texas. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to
adverse trends and economic conditions in this state, including its labor market. In addition, given our geographic concentration in this state, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in
Texas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences in Texas such as local strikes, energy shortages or increases in energy prices, droughts,
earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters. 
 Our expansion into new domestic and/or international markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area.  
        Some of our new restaurants will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different
competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing
markets. An additional risk of expanding into new markets is the lack of market awareness of our brands. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than
restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant-level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach
average unit volumes, if at all, thereby affecting our overall profitability. 
 
 
  Risks Relating to the Food Service Industry     
 Our business is affected by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending.  
        Our success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or
cuisine, particularly beef, would harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the
availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary
spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 Our success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.  
        The restaurant industry is intensely competitive and we compete with many well-established food service companies on the
basis of taste, quality and price of products offered, guest service, atmosphere, location and overall guest experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and
individual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to well-capitalized national restaurant companies. Many of our
competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing and the casual dining segment
of the restaurant industry better than we can. As our competitors expand their operations, we expect competition to intensify. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail businesses
for quality site locations and hourly employees. 
 Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.  
        Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Any increase in food
prices, particularly proteins, could adversely
affect our operating results. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, food safety concerns, product recalls,
global market and trade conditions, and government regulations. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and 
21



 
Table of Contents
react
to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, because we provide a moderately
priced product, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our guests. Also, if we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due
to changes in our guests' menu item selections and guest traffic. 
        We
currently purchase the majority of our beef from three of the largest beef suppliers in the country under annual contracts. While we maintain relationships with additional suppliers,
if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which would harm
our business. 
 The food service industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and
result in significant liabilities or litigation costs.  
        Food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups or government authorities
resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Adverse publicity about these allegations may
negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging guests from eating at our restaurants. We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results
in a decision against us or litigation costs regardless of the result. 
 Health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.  
        Like other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, the key
ingredient in many of our menu items, or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury in general. In recent years there has been
negative publicity concerning e-coli, hepatitis A, "mad cow," "foot-and-mouth" disease and "bird flu." The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing
number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests, resulting in legislation in some jurisdictions which require nutritional
information to be disclosed to guests. Nutritional labeling could be enacted in many additional states, counties or cities as well as on a federal level. Nutritional labeling requirements and negative
publicity concerning any of the food products we serve may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the labeling
requirements or negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu offerings or their ingredients, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or products, and we may not be able to
attract sufficient new guests to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a
change in our concept and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity
or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business. 
 Health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses may have an adverse effect on our business.  
        The United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as Avian Flu, SARS
and H1N1. To the extent that a virus is food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product.
To the extent that a virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public
places, any one of which could adversely affect our business. 
22



 
Table of Contents
 Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages.  
        Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our
managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, unionization, increased minimum and tip wage, state unemployment rates or employee benefits costs or otherwise, would adversely
impact our operating expenses. The federal government and numerous states have enacted legislation resulting in tip and/or minimum wage increases as well as pre-determined future
increases. We anticipate that additional legislation will be enacted in future periods, including some legislation regarding health care benefits.
In addition, a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes could also increase our labor costs. Our operating expenses will be adversely affected to the extent that
we are not able or are unwilling to offset these costs through higher prices on our products. 
        Moreover,
we could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management or hourly labor turnover and potential delays in new restaurant openings or
adverse guest reactions to inadequate guest service levels due to staff shortages. Competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in
higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and training expense. A shortage in the labor pool could also cause our restaurants to be required to operate with reduced staff, which could
negatively impact our ability to provide adequate service levels to our guests. 
        In
addition, our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff, to keep pace with our growth strategy. If we
are unable to do so, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary to operate our restaurants and compliance with laws could adversely affect our operating results.  
        The restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of
food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals, including liquor licenses, could
adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failure to obtain the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants. Local
authorities may revoke, suspend or deny renewal of our liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations. 
        In
addition to our having to comply with these licensing requirements, various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These
laws include minimum and tip wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, working conditions and sales taxes. A
number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including:


additional government-imposed increases in minimum and/or tipped wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated
health benefits; 
increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities;  
any failure of our employees to comply with laws and regulations governing citizenship or residency requirements resulting
in disruption of our work force and adverse publicity against us; 
a reduction in the number of states that allow gratuities to be credited toward minimum wage requirements; and  
increased employee litigation including claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act.

        The
federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be
accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. 
 Complaints or litigation may hurt us.  
        Occasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they
suffered as a result of a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our
business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding consumer, workplace and employment matters, wage
and hour claims, discrimination and similar matters, or we could become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a
growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In addition, we are subject to "dram shop" statutes. These statutes
generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some litigation
against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by
insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims
may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our
restaurants. 
 We rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness or interruption could prevent us from effectively operating our business.  
        We rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, payment of
obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the
reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms could result in delays in guest
service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments. 
 We may incur costs resulting from breaches of security of confidential guest information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.  
        We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2011, approximately 77% of our transactions were by credit or
debit cards, and such card usage could increase. Other retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. We may in the
future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other
proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, in excess of our insurance coverage, which could have an adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants. 
24

 Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.  
        We currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that
cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such damages could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we
self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated
changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 
  Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and our Stock Ownership     
 Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.  
        Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and "blank
check" preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without approval of the stockholders, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such
dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine. The issuance
of blank check preferred stock may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock as our Board of Directors may designate and issue preferred stock with terms that are
senior to our common stock. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. These provisions also may delay, prevent
or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. 
        The
Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us from engaging in "business combinations" with "interested shareholders" (with some exceptions) unless such transaction is approved in a
prescribed manner. The existence of this provision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect
to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.

        Additional
information concerning our properties and leasing arrangements is included in note 2(p) and note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in
Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 
   ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     
        Occasionally, we are a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business, including "slip and fall' accidents,
employment related claims and claims from guests or employees alleging illness, injury or food quality, health or operational concerns. None of
these types of litigation, most of which are covered by insurance, has had a material effect on us and, as of the date of this report, we are not party to any litigation that we believe could have a
material adverse effect on our business other than the litigation discussed below. 
        On
September 30, 2011, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") filed a lawsuit titled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Texas
Roadhouse, Inc., Texas Roadhouse Holdings LLC, Texas Roadhouse Management Corp. in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
Number 1:11-cv-11732. The complaint alleges that we engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination in hiring for certain restaurant positions in violation of
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The complaint alleges that applicants over the age of 40 were denied employment in our restaurants in bartender, host, server and server assistant positions
due to their age. The EEOC is seeking injunctive relief, remedial actions, payment of damages to the applicants and costs. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims made by the EEOC, and
we intend to vigorously defend against them. We have filed a response to the complaint and are in the early phases of discovery. Based on the preliminary status of this matter, we cannot estimate the
possible amount or range of loss, if any, associated with this matter. 
        On
January 19, 2011, a civil case styled as a class action complaint titled Jenna Crenshaw, Andrew Brickley, et al, and all others similarly situated v.
Texas Roadhouse, Inc., Texas Roadhouse Holdings, LLC, Texas Roadhouse of Everett, LLC and Texas Roadhouse Management Corp., d/b/a Texas Roadhouse
("Crenshaw") was filed. The complaint was subsequently amended to add additional plaintiffs. The complaint is pending in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
Number 1:11-cv-10549. The complaint alleges a failure to comply with Massachusetts labor laws, specifically that we improperly shared pooled tips with ineligible
employees in all of our restaurants in Massachusetts. Currently, we operate nine restaurants in the state. We have filed an answer denying all material allegations and are in discovery. Additionally,
we have agreed to participate in mediation. 
        We
believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the Crenshaw case, and we intend to vigorously defend against them, including plaintiffs' efforts to certify a class
action. Based on the preliminary status of this matter, specifically that no class has been certified, we cannot estimate the possible amount or range of loss, if any, associated with this matter.
However, if the court imposes statutory penalties, including restitution of the difference between the tip credit wage and minimum wage, restitution of tips, treble damages and attorneys' fees, then
the case could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows.

        The
number of holders of record of our common stock as of February 15, 2012 was 323. 
        On
February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the payment of a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of common stock. This payment will be distributed on March 30,
2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2012. The declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and
any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings, financial condition, applicable covenants under our credit facility and other
contractual restrictions, or other factors deemed relevant.

comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full 18 months before the beginning of the later fiscal period, excluding sales from restaurants closed during the period.
(4)Average
unit volume represents the average annual restaurant sales from Texas Roadhouse company restaurants open for a full six months before the beginning
of the period measured, excluding sales from restaurants closed during the period. Although 2008 contained 53 weeks, for comparative purposes, 2008 average unit volumes were adjusted to a
52-week basis. Additionally, average unit volume of company-owned restaurants for 2008 and 2007 in the table above were adjusted to reflect the restaurant sales of any acquired franchise
restaurants.

   ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     
        The discussion and analysis below for the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
notes to such financial statements (pages F-1 to F-19), "Forward-looking Statements" (page 3) and Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. 
 Our Company  
        Texas Roadhouse is a growing, moderately priced, full-service restaurant chain. Our founder, chairman and CEO, W. Kent
Taylor, started
the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 365 restaurants in 47 states. In addition, we opened our first international
franchise-owned Texas Roadhouse in Dubai, UAE in 2011. Our mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service®." Our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants
as the local hometown destination for a broad segment of consumers seeking high-quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 27, 2011, our 366
restaurants included:


294 "company restaurants," of which 282 were wholly-owned and 12 were majority-owned. The results of operations of company
restaurants are included in our consolidated operating results. The portion of income attributable to minority interests in company restaurants that are not wholly-owned is reflected in the line item
entitled "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our consolidated statements of income. 
72 "franchise restaurants," of which 69 were franchise restaurants and 3 were license restaurants. We have a 5.0% to 10.0%
ownership interest in 22 franchise restaurants. The income derived from our minority interests in these franchise restaurants is reported in the line item entitled "Equity income from
investments in unconsolidated affiliates" in our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, we provide various management services to these franchise restaurants, as well as six additional
franchise restaurants in which we have no ownership interest. 

        We
have contractual arrangements which grant us the right to acquire at pre-determined valuation formulas (i) the remaining equity interests in ten of the 12
majority-owned company restaurants and (ii) 65 of the franchise restaurants. 
 Presentation of Financial and Operating Data  
        We operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last Tuesday in December. Fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 52 weeks in length,
while the quarters for those years were 13 weeks in length. 
 Long-term Strategies to Grow Earnings Per Share  
        Our long-term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following: 
         Expanding Our Restaurant Base.    We will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop Texas Roadhouse restaurants in existing markets
and new domestic
or international markets. Domestically, we will remain focused primarily on mid-sized markets where we believe a significant demand for our restaurants exists because of population size,
income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base. Our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by many factors beyond our control and
therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth. We moderated our restaurant development plans for 2009 and 2010 due, in part, to increasing restaurant development costs, particularly
during 2006 to 2009. In 2010, our new store returns increased due, in part, to our ability to lower restaurant development costs, along with improved sales in 2010. As a result, we increased
development to 20 restaurants in 2011 and plan to 
33



 
Table of Contents
open
25 restaurants in 2012. Our average capital investment for Texas Roadhouse restaurants opened during 2011, including pre-opening expenses, was $3.76 million, which is
relatively unchanged from our average capital investment in 2010 of $3.74 million. We anticipate that our 2012 development costs will be consistent with our 2011 costs. We continue to focus on
driving sales and managing restaurant development costs in order to further increase our restaurant development in the future. 
        We
may, at our discretion, add franchise restaurants, domestically and/or internationally, primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with the Texas Roadhouse or
other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions. In conjunction with this strategy, we signed
our first international franchise agreement on in 2010 for the development of Texas Roadhouse restaurants in eight countries in the Middle East over the next ten years, the first of which opened in
August 2011. Additionally, in 2010, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a casual dining restaurant operator in China for minority ownership in three non-Texas Roadhouse
restaurants, one of which opened in 2011. We continue to explore opportunities in other countries for international expansion. We may also look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable
to the Company and our stockholders. Additionally, from time to time, we will evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional
concepts. Of the 294 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2011, 291 operated as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, while three operated under
the name of Aspen Creek. All of our planned restaurant growth in 2012 will be Texas Roadhouse restaurants. 
        Maintaining and/or Improving Restaurant Level Profitability.    We plan to maintain, or possibly increase, restaurant level profitability
through a
combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management. In 2011, our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased 5.0% and 4.8%, respectively for Texas
Roadhouse restaurants. The growth in these measures was primarily due to higher guest traffic counts and increases in menu pricing taken throughout 2011. We believe the increased guest traffic counts
is due to our continued focus on encouraging repeat visits by our guests by not sacrificing any operational standards relating to our quality of food and service, along with an improvement in the
overall economy. We also continue to drive various localized marketing programs in order to attract new guests and increase the frequency of visits of our existing guests. In an effort to partially
offset inflationary pressures, we have increased menu prices approximately 2.3% and 2.2% in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In general, we continue to maintain our conservative approach on pricing as we
remain focused on the long-term success of Texas Roadhouse. This may create a challenge in terms of maintaining and/or increasing restaurant margins, as a percentage of sales, in any given
year, depending on the level of inflation we experience. In addition to restaurant margin, as a percentage of sales, we also focus on restaurant margin dollar growth per store week as a measure of
restaurant level profitability. 
        While
our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased in 2010, these measures declined from 2007 through 2009 primarily as a result of lower guest traffic counts and
lower increases in average guest check. We believe the lower guest traffic counts across these periods were primarily attributable to a general softening of the overall consumer environment,
consistent with the casual dining industry, as a whole, experiencing lower guest traffic counts. During this three-year span, consumer casual dining restaurant demand was negatively
impacted by increasing unemployment rates and higher menu prices resulting from inflationary pressures such as certain state minimum and tipped wage increases, along with higher gasoline prices. In
addition, we experienced guests shifting their selections to lower priced menu items and/or purchasing fewer alcoholic beverages over the last few years. We believe all of these pressures negatively
impacted guest traffic counts and average guest check, for us, as well as the industry. 
         Leveraging Our Scalable Infrastructure.    To support our growth, we continue to make investments in our infrastructure. Over the past
several years, we
have made significant investments in our infrastructure including information systems, real estate, human resources, legal, marketing and 
34



 
Table of Contents
operations.
In 2011, general and administrative costs increased at a slower growth rate than our revenue. Whether we are able to continue leveraging our infrastructure will depend, in part, on our new
restaurant and comparable restaurant sales growth rates going forward. 
         Returning Capital to Shareholders.    We continue to look at opportunities to return capital to our shareholders, including through the
repurchases of
common stock and the payment of dividends. In 2011, we paid $59.1 million to repurchase 3,972,100 shares of our common stock and implemented a dividend program through which we declared
quarterly dividends of $0.08 per share of common stock. Since 2008, we have paid $116.1 million to repurchase 10,484,907 shares of our common stock. In 2011, we paid dividends of
$17.0 million. In 2012, we increased our first quarter dividend to $0.09 per share of common stock and our long-term strategy includes increasing that amount over time. The
declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors, including,
but not limited to, earnings, financial condition, applicable covenants under our credit facility and other contractual restrictions, or other factors deemed relevant. 
 Key Operating Personnel  
        Key personnel who have a significant impact on the performance of our restaurants include managing and market partners. Each company
restaurant has one managing partner who serves as the general manager. Market partners can provide supervisory services for up to 10 to 13 managing partners and their respective management teams.
Market partners also assist with our site selection process and recruitment of new management teams. The managing partner of each company restaurant and their corresponding market partners are
required, as a condition of employment, to sign a multi-year employment agreement. The annual compensation of our managing and market partners includes a base salary plus a percentage of
the pre-tax net income of the restaurant(s) they operate or supervise. Managing and market partners are eligible to participate in our equity incentive plan and, as a general rule, are
required to make deposits of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively. Generally, the deposits are refunded after five years of service. 
 Key Measures We Use To Evaluate Our Company  
        Key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following: 
        Number of Restaurant Openings.    Number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular fiscal
period. For company
restaurant openings we incur pre-opening costs, which are defined below, before the restaurant opens. Typically new restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher
than normalized sales volumes, which decrease to a steady level approximately three to six months after opening. However, although sales volumes are generally higher, so are initial costs, resulting
in restaurant operating margins that are generally lower during the start-up period of operation and increase to a steady level approximately three to six months after opening. 
        Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth.    Comparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the
company restaurants in the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full 18 months before the beginning of the later fiscal
period excluding restaurants closed during the period. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be impacted by changes in guest traffic counts or by changes in the per person average check amount. Menu
price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount. 
        Average Unit Volume.    Average unit volume represents the average annual restaurant sales for company-owned Texas Roadhouse restaurants
open for a full
six months before the beginning of the period measured. Average unit volume excludes sales on restaurants closed during the period. Growth 
35



 
Table of Contents
in
average unit volumes in excess of comparable restaurant sales growth is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the company average. Conversely,
growth in average unit volumes less than growth in comparable restaurant sales growth is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels lower than the company average. 
         Store Weeks.    Store weeks represent the number of weeks that our company restaurants were open during the reporting period. 
         Restaurant Margins.    Restaurant margins represent restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs. Restaurant margins, as a percentage
of restaurant
sales, may fluctuate based on inflationary pressures, commodity costs and wage rates. 
 Other Key Definitions  
         Restaurant Sales.    Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and discounts. Sales taxes collected from
customers and
remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from restaurant sales in the consolidated statements of income. 
         Franchise Royalties and Fees.    Domestic franchisees typically pay a $40,000 initial franchise fee for each new restaurant and a
franchise renewal fee
equal to the greater of 30% of the then-current initial franchise fee or $10,000 to $15,000. Franchise royalties consist of royalties in an amount up to 4.0% of gross sales, as defined in
our franchise agreement, paid to us by our domestic franchisees. 
         Restaurant Cost of Sales.    Restaurant cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs. 
         Restaurant Labor Expenses.    Restaurant labor expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred
in operations except for profit sharing incentive compensation expenses earned by our restaurant managers. These profit sharing expenses are reflected in restaurant other operating expenses.
Restaurant labor expenses also include share-based compensation expense related to restaurant-level employees. 
         Restaurant Rent Expense.    Restaurant rent expense includes all rent associated with the leasing of operating real estate and includes
base, percentage
and straight-line rent expense. 
         Restaurant Other Operating Expenses.    Restaurant other operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the
major components
of which are utilities, supplies, advertising, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, credit card fees and general liability insurance. Profit sharing allocations to managing partners and market
partners are also included in restaurant other operating expenses. 
         Pre-opening Expenses.    Pre-opening expenses, which are charged to operations as incurred, consist of expenses incurred before
the opening of a new restaurant and are comprised principally of opening team and training salaries, travel expenses, rent, and food, beverage and other initial supplies and expenses. 
        Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.    Depreciation and amortization expenses ("D&A") includes the depreciation of fixed assets and
amortization of
intangibles with definite lives. 
         Impairment and closure costs.    Impairment and closure costs include any impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, associated
with restaurants where the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset and expenses associated with the closure of a restaurant. Closure costs also include
any gains or losses associated with the sale of a closed restaurant and/or assets held for sale.

         General and Administrative Expenses.    General and administrative expenses ("G&A") are comprised of expenses associated with
corporate and
administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth. Supervision and accounting fees received from certain franchise
restaurants and license restaurants are offset against G&A. G&A also includes share-based compensation expense related to executive officers, support center employees and area managers, including
market partners. 
         Interest Expense, Net.    Interest expense includes the cost of our debt obligations including the amortization of loan fees, reduced by
interest income
and capitalized interest. Interest income includes earnings on cash and cash equivalents. 
         Equity Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates.    As of December 27, 2011, we owned 5.0% to 10.0% equity interest in 22 franchise
restaurants. As of December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009, we owned 5.0% to 10.0% equity interest in 21 franchise restaurants. Equity income from unconsolidated affiliates
represents our percentage share of net income earned by these unconsolidated affiliates. 
         Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.    Minority interest represents the portion of income attributable to the other
owners of the
majority-owned or controlled restaurants. Our consolidated subsidiaries at December 27, 2011 included 12 majority-owned restaurants, all of which were open. Our consolidated subsidiaries at
December 28, 2010 included 11 majority-owned restaurants, all of which were open. Our consolidated subsidiaries at December 29, 2009 included ten majority-owned restaurants, all of which
were open. 
         Managing Partners and Market Partners.    Managing partners are single unit operators who have primary responsibility for the
day-to-day operations of the entire restaurant and are responsible for maintaining the standards of quality and performance we establish. Market partners, generally, have
supervisory responsibilities for up to 10 to 13 restaurants. In addition to supervising the operations of

our
restaurants, they are also responsible for the hiring and development of each restaurant's management team and assist in the new restaurant site selection process.

 Restaurant Sales  
        Restaurant sales increased by 10.4% in 2011 as compared to 2010. This increase was attributable to the opening of new restaurants and
an increase in average unit volumes, primarily comparable restaurant sales. Restaurant sales increased by 6.6% in 2010 compared to 2009.
This increase was attributable to the opening of new restaurants and the acquisitions of franchise restaurants in fiscal 2008, partially offset by a decrease in comparable restaurant sales and average
unit volumes.

Table of Contents 
        The increase in store weeks for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was primarily attributable to the opening of new restaurants. Company restaurant count activity is shown in
the restaurant unit activity table above. 
        The
increase in average unit volumes for 2011 compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily driven by a combination of positive comparable restaurant sales and higher
year-over-year sales at newer restaurants. For 2011, comparable restaurant sales increased 4.7% which was generated by an increase in guest traffic counts and an increase in
our per person average check. For 2010, comparable restaurant sales increased 2.4% which was generated by an increase in guest traffic counts, partially offset by a slight decline in our per person
average check. 
        While
we did not take any pricing increases in 2010 due to the favorable commodities environment, we did take menu price increases totaling 2.3% during 2011 as a result of expected
inflationary pressures, primarily commodities. The menu price increases we have taken throughout 2011 drove the increase in our per person average check. 
        In
2012, we plan to open approximately 25 additional company restaurants. We have either begun construction or have sites under contract for purchase or lease for 24 of the 25
restaurants. We may
evaluate additional opportunities for international development and possibly acquiring franchise restaurants in 2012. 
 Franchise Royalties and Fees  
        Franchise royalties and fees increased by $0.7 million or by 8.3% in 2011 from 2010 and increased by $0.8 million or by
9.4% in 2010 from 2009. These increases was primarily attributable to an increase in average unit volumes, increasing royalty rates in conjunction with the renewal of certain franchise agreements, and
the opening of new franchise restaurants. Franchise comparable restaurant sales increased by 4.3% in 2011 and 2.5% in 2010. Franchise restaurant count activity is shown in the restaurant unit activity
table above. 
 Restaurant Cost of Sales  
        Restaurant cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant sales, increased to 33.4% in 2011 from 32.6% in 2010. This increase was
primarily attributable to commodity inflation of approximately 3.5% for 2011. Inflation has been driven by higher food costs on items such as potatoes, pork, beef, cheese and wheat ingredients. For
2012, we have fixed price contracts, which include some floor and ceiling pricing, for 65% to 70% of our overall food costs with the remainder subject to fluctuating market prices. We expect commodity
cost inflation of approximately 8.0% in 2012. 
        Restaurant
cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant sales, decreased to 32.6% in 2010 from 33.5% in 2009. This decrease was primarily attributable to the benefit of lower beef costs
and lower food costs on items such as oil-based and wheat ingredients. 
 Restaurant Labor Expenses  
        Restaurant labor expenses, as a percentage of restaurant sales, increased to 29.7% in 2011 from 29.4% in 2010. Higher payroll taxes and
the impact of labor inefficiencies associated with newer restaurants were partially offset by the benefit from an increase in average unit volumes and lower workers' compensation costs. 
        In
2011, higher payroll tax expense was primarily due to the benefit we obtained in 2010 from exemptions under the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, which was recorded
as a reduction in payroll tax expense. For 2011, the exemptions under the HIRE Act were replaced by a tax credit which results in a reduction in income tax expense rather than payroll tax expense. For
2011, the net impact of this change year-over-year was an increase in payroll expense of $1.8 million. In addition, we have experienced higher state unemployment taxes
throughout 2011. 
40



 
Table of Contents
        Workers'
compensation costs were $0.5 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due to changes in our claims development history. Increased development in 2011 compared to the prior
year has negatively impacted labor expense, as a percentage of sales. Typically new restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normalized sales volumes and higher than
normalized labor costs. These tend to normalize approximately three to six months after opening. 
        Restaurant
labor expenses, as a percentage of restaurant sales, decreased to 29.4% in 2010 from 29.6% in 2009. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in average unit
volumes and lower payroll tax expense, partially offset by higher average wage rates. Additionally, lower workers' compensation claims experience resulted in lower
year-over-year workers' compensation expense for 2010. 
        In
2012, we anticipate our labor costs will be pressured by inflation due to state-mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates. At this time, we have approximately 50 restaurants in
6 states which have announced increases in minimum and tip wage rates effective January 1, 2012. We expect these increases in costs will be offset by menu price actions taken, along with
traffic growth, in the first quarter of 2012. 
 Restaurant Rent Expense  
        Restaurant rent expense, as a percentage of restaurant sales, remained unchanged at 2.1% in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009. In 2011 and
2010, the benefit from an increase in average unit volumes offset the impact of leasing more land and buildings than in the past. 
 Restaurant Other Operating Expenses  
        Restaurant other operating expenses, as a percentage of restaurant sales, decreased to 16.7% in 2011 from 17.4% in 2010. This decrease
was attributable to an increase in average unit volumes and lower general liability insurance, utility and property tax costs. General liability insurance costs were lower in 2011 as we had additional
insurance expense in 2010 of $1.5 million due to changes in our claims development history related to our 2010 quarterly actuarial reports. Utility costs were lower primarily due to lower
electricity and natural gas prices. 
        Restaurant
other operating expenses, as a percentage of restaurant sales, increased to 17.4% in 2010 from 17.0% in 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to higher costs for
managing partner and market partner bonuses, as a percentage of sales, and higher general liability insurance costs, partially offset by an increase in average unit volumes. Managing partner and
market partner bonuses were higher in 2010 as a result of improved restaurant sales and higher margins. 
 Restaurant Pre-opening Expenses  
        Pre-opening expenses in 2011 increased to $11.5 million from $7.1 million in 2010. This increase was
primarily attributable to more restaurant openings in 2011 compared to 2010, along with more planned restaurant openings in 2012. We opened 20 company restaurants in 2011 compared to 15 company
restaurants in 2010. Additionally, we plan to open 25 company restaurants in 2012. Pre-opening costs will fluctuate from period to period based on the number and timing of restaurant
openings and the number and timing of restaurant managers hired. Based on our increased restaurant development plans, we expect pre-opening expense to be higher in 2012. 
        Pre-opening
expenses in 2010 increased to $7.1 million from $5.8 million in 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to more restaurants in the
development pipeline during 2010 as compared to 2009, driven by our plan to open 20 company restaurants in 2011 as compared to 14 company restaurants in 2010.

Table of Contents
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses ("D&A")  
        D&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 3.9% in 2011 from 4.1% in 2010 and decreased to 4.1% in 2010 from 4.4% in 2009. These
decreases were primarily attributable to an increase in average unit volumes. In addition, lower depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, on short-lived assets in older restaurants was
partially offset by higher depreciation expense, as a percentage of revenue, on the same type of assets in newer restaurants. 
 Impairment and Closure Expenses  
        Impairment and closure expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2011 from $2.0 million in 2010 which was a decrease from
$3.0 million in 2009. In 2011, we recorded $0.8 million of impairment expense associated with the impairment of goodwill related to one restaurant and $0.3 million of impairment
expense associated with the write down of assets, primarily land and building, related to a restaurant which was closed in 2010. In 2010, we recorded $1.7 million of impairment expense
associated with the impairment of goodwill related to four restaurants and $0.2 million related to the write-down of equipment and ongoing closure costs associated with one
restaurant, which was closed in 2010. In 2009, impairment and closure expenses included $3.2 million associated with the impairment of goodwill, reacquired franchise rights and other
long-lived assets (primarily building and equipment). Additionally, in 2009, we recorded a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of one restaurant which was relocated, a charge
of $0.5 million in conjunction with the closure of one restaurant, and a credit of $0.1 million related to the settlement of a lease reserve associated with one restaurant which was
closed in 2008. For all years presented, we also incurred costs primarily attributable to various restaurant closures in prior fiscal years. 
        The
goodwill impairment charges in 2011, 2010 and 2009 resulted from our annual testing, which relies, in part, on the historical and projected future cash flows of individual
restaurants. We assign goodwill at the individual restaurant level. As such, we anticipate that we will incur future impairment charges as the historical and/or projected future financial performance
of these restaurants change. The amount and timing of any potential future charges, however, is difficult to predict. 
        See
note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, including the impairments of
goodwill and other long-lived assets. 
 General and Administrative Expenses ("G&A")  
        G&A, as a percentage of total revenue, remained unchanged at 5.2% in 2011 compared to 2010. For 2011, an increase in average unit
volumes and lower performance-based bonus expense as a result of lower plan profitability compared to the prior year were offset by higher costs associated with share-based compensation costs, legal
fees, marketing and travel costs. In 2011, share-based compensation costs were $1.0 million higher as a result of a grant of restricted stock units on January 8, 2011 in conjunction with
the extension of certain executive employment contracts at the beginning of 2010. In addition, in the first quarter of 2011, we incurred a one-time charge of $0.5 million related to
restricted stock units granted in 2010. 
        We
expect share-based compensation costs to be approximately $1.8 million higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by a higher stock price associated with a grant of
restricted stock units on January 7, 2012 in conjunction with the execution of certain executive employment contracts at the beginning of 2012. Overall, in 2012, we expect total G&A costs to
increase at a slower growth rate than our revenue. 
        G&A,
as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 5.2% in 2010 from 5.0% in 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher costs associated with our annual managing partner

Table of Contents
conference
and higher salary expense, partially offset by an increase in average unit volumes. Costs associated with our annual conference were $3.4 million in 2010 compared to
$2.0 million in 2009. The majority of these costs were incurred during the second fiscal quarter in each year. 
 Interest Expense, Net  
        Net interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in 2011 from $2.7 million in 2010 which was a decrease from
$3.3 million in 2009. The decrease in 2011 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. The decrease in 2010
was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and lower interest rates. 
 Income Taxes  
        We account for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). Our effective tax rate decreased to 29.5% in 2011 from 32.2% in 2010. The decrease in 2011was primarily
attributable to higher federal tax credits, including HIRE Act tax credits, lower non-deductible officer's compensation, and the benefit of certain incentive stock options exercised during
the quarter. The HIRE Act tax credit is a 2011 federal tax credit enacted to encourage the retention of new hires for 52 weeks. The credit is only available for eligible new employees hired
between February 4, 2010 and December 31, 2010 that remain employed for 52 consecutive weeks. Prior to 2011, as part of the HIRE Act, we received payroll tax exemptions, which lowered
our restaurant labor expenses in 2010. For 2012, we expect the tax rate to increase to 32.5% to 33.0% primarily due to lower federal tax credits, based on the expiration of the HIRE Act and worker
opportunity tax credits, and an expected increase in non-deductible officer's compensation. 
        Our
effective tax rate decreased to 32.2% in 2010 from 33.1% in 2009. The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributable to higher work opportunity tax credits, lower
non-deductible stock compensation expense and lower non-deductible officers' compensation. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher profitability, which led to
a lower benefit, on a percentage basis, of federal tax credits. The higher work opportunity tax credits resulted from the expansion of the federal program for disconnected youth for eligible employees
hired through 2010.

        Net
cash provided by operating activities was $137.5 million in 2011 compared to $119.9 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to changes in working capital,
along with increases in share-based compensation and net income. Net income was $5.7 million higher as a result of opening new restaurants and average unit volume growth, partially offset by
lower margins. Net cash provided by operating activities was $119.9 million in 2010 compared to $115.1 million in 2009. This increase was

primarily
due to higher net income, partially offset by other changes in working capital. Net income was $11.4 million higher as a result of opening new restaurants, average unit volume growth
and higher margins. 
        Our
operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate with negative working capital. Sales are primarily for
cash, and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies, thereby reducing the need
for incremental working capital to support growth. 
        Net
cash used in investing activities was $81.6 million in 2011 compared to $44.8 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to spending on capital expenditures as a
result of more restaurant openings in 2011 compared to 2010 and more planned openings in 2012. We opened 20 company restaurants in 2011 and plan to open 25 company restaurants in 2012. Net cash used
in investing activities was $44.8 million in 2010 compared to $43.1 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to spending on capital expenditures. While we opened 14 restaurants
in 2010, compared to 17 restaurants in 2009, we had more restaurants in the development pipeline in 2010 as a result of planned increased growth in 2011. 
        We
require capital principally for the development of new company restaurants, the refurbishment of existing restaurants and the acquisitions of franchise restaurants, if any. We either
lease our restaurant site locations under operating leases for periods of five to 30 years (including renewal periods) or purchase the land where it is cost effective. As of December 27,
2011, there were 121 restaurants developed on land which we owned. 
        The
following table presents a summary of capital expenditures related to the development of new restaurants, the refurbishment of existing restaurants and the acquisition of franchise
restaurants:

(2)These
amounts were recorded as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 

        Our
future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new restaurants we open, the timing of those openings and the restaurant prototype developed in a given fiscal
year. These requirements will include costs directly related to opening new restaurants and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure is able to support a larger restaurant
base. In 2012, we expect our capital expenditures to be $80.0 to $85.0 million, the majority of which will relate to planned restaurant openings, including 25 restaurant openings in 2012. This
amount excludes any cash used for franchise acquisitions. We intend to satisfy our capital requirements over the next 12 months with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and,
if needed, funds available under our credit facility. For 2012, we anticipate net cash provided by operating activities will exceed capital expenditures, which we currently plan to use to repurchase
common stock, pay dividends, as approved by our Board of Directors, and/or repay borrowings under our credit facility. 
        Net
cash used in financing activities was $64.4 million in 2011 compared to $39.7 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the repurchase of shares of common
stock in 2011 of $59.1 million,

the
payment of dividends in 2011 of $17.0 million and a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by increased borrowings under our credit facility of
$10.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $39.7 million in 2010 compared to $30.4 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to increased payments on
borrowings under our credit facility, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
        On
February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. On
August 18, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $50.0 million increase in our stock repurchase program. During 2011, we paid approximately $59.1 million to repurchase 3,972,100
shares of our common stock and we had
$40.9 million remaining under our authorized stock repurchase program as of December 27, 2011. On February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors cancelled this stock repurchase
program, which had no expiration date, and approved a new stock repurchase program under which it authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock. Any repurchases
will be made through open market transactions. The timing and the amount of any repurchases will be determined by management under parameters established by our Board of Directors, based on its
evaluation of our stock price, market conditions and other corporate considerations 
        We
paid cash dividends of $17.0 million in 2011. On November 17, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the payment of a cash dividend of $0.08 per share of common stock.
This payment was distributed on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2011. The declared dividends are included as a liability on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2011. Additionally, on February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the payment of a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of common
stock. This payment will be distributed on March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2012. The increase in the dividend per share amount reflects the
increase in our annual dividend rate from $0.32 per share in 2011 to $0.36 per share in 2012. The declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of
Directors, and any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings, financial condition, applicable covenants under our credit facility and
other contractual restrictions, or other factors deemed relevant. 
        We
paid distributions of $2.3 million and $2.2 million to equity holders of 11 of our majority-owned company restaurants in 2011 and 10 of our majority-owned company
restaurants in 2010, respectively. In 2009, we paid $2.1 million to equity holders of nine of our majority-owned company restaurants. 
        On
August 12, 2011, we entered into a new $200.0 million five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by JP Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo, N.A. This facility replaces our previous five-year revolving credit facility. The new facility expires on August 12, 2016. The
terms of the facility require us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.875%, depending on our leverage ratio, or the
Alternate Base Rate, which is the higher of the issuing bank's prime lending rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.150% to 0.350% per year on any
unused portion of the facility, depending on our leverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate for the revolver at December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 was 3.20% and 3.59%,
respectively, including interest rate swaps. At December 27, 2011, we had $60.0 million of outstanding borrowing under our credit facility and $136.2 million of availability net
of $3.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. At December 28, 2010 we had $50.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and $196.2 million of
availability net of $3.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
        The
lenders' obligation to extend credit under the facility depends on us maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to
1.00 and a 
45



 
Table of Contents
maximum
consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the facility, except for the incurrence of secured
indebtedness that in the aggregate exceeds 20% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured indebtedness would prevent us from complying with
our financial covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 27, 2011. 
        In
addition to the amounts outstanding from our credit facility, we had various other notes payable totaling $1.7 million and $1.9 million at December 27, 2011 and
December 28, 2010, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 10.46% to 10.80%. Each of these notes relate to the financing of specific restaurants. Our total weighted average effective
interest rate at December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 was 3.40% and 3.84%, respectively. 
        On
October 22, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap, starting on November 7, 2008, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash
flows of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 3.83% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 1-month LIBOR for a term ending on November 7, 2015, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the
$25.0 million notional amount. Our counterparty in the interest rate swap is JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
        On
January 7, 2009, we entered into another interest rate swap, starting on February 7, 2009, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash
flows of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 2.34% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 1-month LIBOR rate for a term ending on January 7, 2016, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the
$25.0 million notional amount. Our counterparty in this interest rate swap is JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
        Except for operating leases (primarily restaurant leases), we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Guarantees  
        We entered into real estate lease agreements for franchise restaurants located in Everett, MA, Longmont, CO, Montgomeryville, PA,
Fargo, ND and Logan, UT prior to our granting franchise rights for those restaurants. We have subsequently assigned the leases to the franchisees, but we remain contingently liable if a franchisee
defaults under the terms of a lease. The Longmont lease expires in May 2014, the Everett lease expires in February 2018, the Montgomeryville lease expires in March 2021, the Fargo lease expires in
July 2016 and the Logan lease expires on August 2019. As the fair value of these guarantees is not considered significant, no liability value has been recorded. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Fair Value Measures and Disclosures
(ASU 2010-06)  

        In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2010-06 which amends ASC 820, Fair
Value Measures and Disclosures. ASU No. 2010-06 amends the ASC to require disclosure of transfer into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
measurements, and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. The changes as a result of this update are effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 (our 2010 fiscal year), except for requirements related to Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for annual and interim period
beginning after December 15, 2010 (our 2011 fiscal year). This guidance requires new disclosures only, and had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 

Comprehensive Income
(ASU 2011-05)  

        In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, which is our current
presentation, and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued
ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in
ASU 2011-05, to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated comprehensive income to net
income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income. All other provisions of 
47



 
Table of Contents
this
update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 (our 2012 fiscal year). The adoption of this new guidance will have no impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, though it will change our financial statement presentation. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
(ASU 2011-08)  

        In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for
Impairment, which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value
before applying the two-step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place. If it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely
than not greater than its carrying value, the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary. The qualitative assessment is optional, allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment.
This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 (our 2012 fiscal year), with early adoption permitted. We
do not anticipate any changes to the content of our financial statements or disclosures as a result of adopting this guidance. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
        The above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to
the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also
require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being
reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. 
         Impairment of Long-lived Assets.    We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. When we evaluate restaurants, cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment. Our evaluation
requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life, which can be for a period of over 20 years. In the estimation of
future cash flows, we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth. We limit
assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable
restaurants. Both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating
for potential impairments. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge. 
48




 










Table of Contents 
        If assets are determined to be impaired, we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The
determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment. We generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal,
if available. When fair value is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows, the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use. We also use a
discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. 
        See
note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, including the impairments of
goodwill and other long-lived assets. 
         Goodwill.    Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset
might be
impaired. We have assigned goodwill to the reporting unit, which we consider to be the individual restaurant level. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of impairment consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. The fair value of
the reporting unit may be based on several valuation
approaches including capitalization of earnings, discounted cash flows, comparable public company market multiples and comparable acquisition market multiples. Second, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied
fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. 
        The
valuation approaches used to determine fair value are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgment and assumptions about our appropriate
revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and comparable company and acquisition market multiples. In estimating the fair value using the discounted cash flows or the
capitalization of earnings method we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such period and future periods, expectations of future sales growth and
terminal value. Assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual
results at comparable restaurants. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact our fair value. The judgments and
assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only our reasonable expectations regarding
future developments. If the estimates used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate, the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower, thereby causing the
carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred. 
        At
December 27, 2011, we had 64 reporting units, primarily at the restaurant level, with allocated goodwill of $111.0 million. The average amount of goodwill associated
with each reporting unit is $1.7 million with six reporting units having goodwill in excess of $4.0 million. Based on our estimate of fair value, we are currently monitoring seven
restaurants with total goodwill of $16.6 million for potential impairment. Since we determine the fair value of goodwill at the restaurant level, any significant decreases in cash flows at
these restaurants or others could trigger an impairment charge in the future. The fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of
the 2011 goodwill impairment test. See note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, including the
impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets.

         Insurance Reserves.    We self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, general liability,
employment
practices liability and property insurance programs. In addition, starting in fiscal 2011, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses
under our employee healthcare insurance program. We purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below:

        We
record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by management, a third party
administrator and/or an actuary. Our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development
history and settlement practices. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 100 basis points would change the reserve, and resulting expense, by an immaterial amount. We also monitor actuarial
observations of historical claim development for the industry. Our assumptions are reviewed, monitored, and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. 
         Income Taxes.    We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based
upon
anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is
established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered
more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 
        Uncertain
tax positions are accounted for under FASB ASC 740. FASB ASC 740 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of
all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. 
         Leases and Leasehold Improvements.    We lease land, buildings and/or certain equipment for the majority of our restaurants under
non-cancelable lease agreements. Our land and building leases typically have initial terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, and certain renewal options for one or more
five-year periods. We account for leases in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, and other related authoritative guidance. When determining the
lease term, we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such an amount that a renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured.
The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might become impaired if we choose not to continue the use of the
leased property. 
        Certain
of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent during the original term of the lease. For these leases, we recognize the related rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as deferred rent. We generally do not receive rent
concessions or leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a restaurant that is subject to a lease. We may receive rent holidays, which would begin on the possession date and end on the date
construction of the restaurant begins, during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease. Rent holidays are included in the lease term when determining
straight-line rent expense. 
50



 
Table of Contents
        Additionally,
certain of our operating leases contain clauses that provide for additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. We
recognize contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent, provided achievement of the target is considered probable. This may result in some
variability in rent expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent. 
        We
make judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday
and/or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized. These
judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used. 
        In
an exposure draft issued in 2010, the FASB, together with the International Accounting Standards Board, has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in Generally Accepted Accounting
Policies ("GAAP") for leases. We are continuing to monitor the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board's activities regarding leases and will disclose expected impacts on our business and
financial statements as rules are finalized. 
 Effects of Inflation  
        We believe inflation has had a negative effect on our restaurant profitability during the past few years as we have not substantially
offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu, increasing menu prices and/or making other adjustments. Whether we are able and/or choose to
offset the effects of inflation will determine to what, if any, extent inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.  
 
   ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     
        We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate
fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt. Our options for the rate are the Base Rate, which is the higher of the issuing bank's prime lending rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or
LIBOR plus an applicable margin. At December 27, 2011, there was $60.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which bears interest at approximately 87.5 to
187.5 basis points (depending on our leverage ratios) over LIBOR. We had various other notes payable totaling $1.7 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 10.46% to 10.80%. 
        On
October 22, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap, which started on November 7, 2008, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash
flows of our variable rate credit facility.
We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a $25.0 million tranche of floating rate
debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 3.83% on the $25.0 million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty
based on the 1-month LIBOR rate for a term ending on November 7, 2015, effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the LIBOR component of the $25.0 million notional amount. 
        On
January 7, 2009, we entered into another interest rate swap, starting February 7, 2009, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash
flows of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 2.34% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the

LIBOR rate for a term ending on January 7, 2016, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the $25.0 million notional amount. 
        By
using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the
terms of the derivative contract. We minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Our
counterparty in the interest rate swap is JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
        Many
of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility. There are no established fixed price markets for
certain commodities such as produce and cheese, and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities. For other commodities, we employ various purchasing and
pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility, including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating market
prices. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness. Extreme and/or long term increases in commodity prices could
adversely affect our future results, especially if we are unable, primarily due to competitive reasons, to increase menu prices. Additionally, if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity
prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases, our short-term
financial results could be negatively affected. 
        We
are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors. While we maintain relationships with additional suppliers, if any of these vendors were unable
to fulfill its obligations under its contracts, we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, any of which would harm our business.

 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  
        We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to, and as defined
in, Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, performed under the
supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 27, 2011. 
 Changes in internal control  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, there were no changes with respect to our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
        Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
        Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected
by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. 
        Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of the end of the period covered by this report. In this assessment, the Company applied criteria based on the "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company's
assessment included documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based upon this evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 27, 2011. 
        KPMG LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, has
also audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2011 as stated in their report at F-1.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Texas Roadhouse, Inc.: 
        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 27,
2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 27, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Texas Roadhouse, Inc.'s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 27, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Texas Roadhouse, Inc.: 
        We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. as of December 27, 2011, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Texas
Roadhouse, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Texas
Roadhouse Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        In
our opinion, Texas Roadhouse, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2011, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Texas Roadhouse, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2011, and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries  
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
 (Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)  
 (1) Description of Business  

        The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 include the accounts of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the "Company", "we",
"our" and/or "us"), and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Texas Roadhouse Holdings LLC ("Holdings"), Texas Roadhouse Development Corporation ("TRDC"), Texas Roadhouse Management Corp ("Management
Corp.") and Aspen Creek, LLC ("Aspen Creek"). We and our wholly-owned subsidiaries operate restaurants under the names Texas Roadhouse and Aspen Creek. Holdings also provides supervisory and
administrative services for certain other license and franchise restaurants. TRDC sells franchise rights and collects the franchise royalties and fees. Management Corp. provides management services to
Holdings, TRDC and certain other license and franchise restaurants. 
        As
of December 27, 2011, we owned and operated 294 restaurants and franchised and licensed an additional 72 restaurants in 47 states and one foreign country. Of the 294
restaurants we owned and operated, 291 operated as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, while three operated under the name of Aspen Creek. Of the 366 restaurants that were operating at December 27,
2011, (i) 294 were Company-owned restaurants, 282 of which were wholly-owned and 12 of which were majority-owned, (ii) 69 were franchise restaurants and (iii) 3 were license
restaurants. 
        As
of December 28, 2010, we owned and operated 274 restaurants and franchised or licensed an additional 71 restaurants in 46 states. Of the 274 restaurants we owned and operated,
271 operated as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, while three operated under the name of Aspen Creek. Of the 345 restaurants that were operating at December 28, 2010, (i) 274 were
Company-owned restaurants, 263 of which were wholly-owned and 11 of which were majority-owned, (ii) 68 were franchise restaurants and (iii) 3 were license restaurants. 
 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

 (a)    Principles of Consolidation  

        At December 27, 2011, and December 28, 2010, we had minority ownership in 22 and 21 restaurants, respectively. The
unconsolidated restaurants are accounted for using the equity method. We exercise significant control over the operating and financial policies of these entities based on the rights granted to us
under each entity's operating or partnership agreement. Notwithstanding the significant control exercised by us over their affairs, we do not consolidate such entities because (i) we own only
5% to 10% of these entities and (ii) the revenue, expense and net income, and assets and liabilities that would be attributable to these entities would not be material to our financial position
or results of operations. Should the financial position and results of operations of these entities become material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods, we will
consolidate the entities into our results. All significant intercompany balances and transactions for these unconsolidated restaurants as well as the companies whose accounts have been consolidated
have been eliminated. 

 (b)    Fiscal Year  

        We utilize a 52 or 53 week accounting period that ends on the last Tuesday in December. We utilize a 13 or 14 week
accounting period for quarterly reporting purposes. Fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 52 weeks in length.

 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 (c)    Cash and Cash Equivalents  

        For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Book overdrafts are recorded in accounts payable and are included within operating cash flows. 

 (d)    Receivables  

        Receivables consist principally of amounts due from certain franchise and license restaurants for reimbursement of labor costs,
pre-opening and other expenses, amounts due for royalty fees from franchise restaurants and credit card receivables. 
        Receivables
are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing
accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical write-off experience. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due balances over 120 days
and a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for
recovery is considered remote. 

 (e)    Inventories  

        Inventories, consisting principally of food, beverages and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. 

 (f)    Pre-opening Expenses  

        Pre-opening expenses are charged to operations as incurred. These costs include wages, benefits, travel and lodging for the
training and opening management teams, rent and food, beverage and other restaurant operating expenses incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business. 

 (g)    Property and Equipment  

        Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized while expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed on property and equipment, including assets located on leased properties, over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the related assets or the underlying lease term using the straight-line method. In some cases, assets on leased properties are depreciated over a period of time which includes both the
initial term of the lease and one or more option periods. See note 2(p). 
        The
estimated useful lives are: 













 Land improvements
 
 
10 - 25 years
 


 Buildings and leasehold improvements
 
 
10 - 25 years
 


 Equipment and smallwares
 
 
3 - 10 years
 


 Furniture and fixtures
 
 
3 - 10 years

 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
        Repairs
and maintenance expense amounted to $12.6 million, $11.9 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 27, 2011, December 28, 2010 and
December 29, 2009, respectively. These costs are included in other operating costs in our consolidated statements of income. 

 (h)    Impairment of Goodwill  

        Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), we perform tests to assess potential impairments at the end
of each fiscal year or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may be impaired. Our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level, which is at the individual
restaurant level. In the first step of the review process, we compare the estimated fair value of the restaurant with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the
restaurant exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is needed. If the estimated fair value of the restaurant is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the review process requires
the calculation of the implied fair value of the goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the restaurant to all of the assets and liabilities of the restaurant as if it had been acquired in
a business combination. If the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the
restaurant exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for that excess amount. 
        The
valuation approaches used to determine fair value are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgment and assumptions about our appropriate
revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital and comparable company and acquisition market multiples. In estimating the fair value using the discounted cash flows or the
capitalization of earnings method, we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such period and future periods, expectations of future sales growth and
terminal value. Assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual
results at comparable restaurants. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact our fair value. The judgments and
assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only our reasonable expectations regarding
future developments. If the estimates used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate, the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower, thereby causing the
carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred. 
        In
2011, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that goodwill related to one restaurant was impaired as discussed further in note 14. Refer to
note 5 for additional information related to goodwill and intangible assets. 

 (i)    Other Assets  

        Other assets consist primarily of deferred compensation plan assets, deposits and costs related to the issuance of debt. The debt
issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. For further discussion of the deferred compensation plan, see note 13.

 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 (j)    Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets  

        In accordance with ASC 360-10-05, Property, Plant and
Equipment, long-lived assets related to each restaurant to be held and used in the business, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to
amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. When we evaluate restaurants, cash flows
are the primary indicator of impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the restaurant. Our evaluation requires an estimation of future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life, which can be for a
period of over 20 years. In the estimation of future cash flows, we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such period and future periods and
expectations of future sales growth. Assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the
restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. We generally measure fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal, if available. When fair value
is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows, the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use. We also use a discount rate that is
commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows. The adjusted carrying amounts of assets to be held and used are depreciated over their remaining useful life. Assets to be disposed of
within a year would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. In
2011, as a result of our impairment analysis, we determined that the land, building, equipment, furniture and fixtures as one restaurant was impaired. For further discussion regarding closures and
impairments recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, including the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets, refer to note 14. 

 (k)    Insurance Reserves  

        We self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, general liability, employment
practices liability, property insurance and employee healthcare programs. We purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below: 













 Employment practices liability
 
$
250,000
 


 Workers compensation
 
$
250,000
 


 General liability
 
$
250,000
 


 Property
 
$
50,000
 


 Employee healthcare
 
$
150,000
 




        We
record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at our anticipated cost based on estimates provided by a third party administrator
and/or actuary. The estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement
practices. Our assumptions are reviewed, monitored, and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances.

 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 (l)    Segment Reporting  

        We consider our restaurant and franchising operations as similar and have aggregated them into a single reportable segment. The
majority of the restaurants operate in the U.S. within the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, providing similar products to similar customers. The restaurants also possess similar
pricing structures, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. As of December 27, 2011, we operated 294 restaurants, each as a single operating
segment, and franchised or licensed an additional 72 restaurants. Revenue from external customers is derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source
of revenue. We aggregate similar operating segments into a single reportable operating segment if the businesses are considered similar under ASC 280, Segment
Reporting. 

 (m)    Revenue Recognition  

        Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. Deferred revenue primarily represents our
liability for gift cards and certificates that have been sold, but not yet redeemed. When the gift cards and certificates are redeemed, we recognize restaurant sales and reduce deferred revenue. 
        For
some of the gift cards that were sold, the likelihood of redemption is remote. When the likelihood of a gift card's redemption is determined to be remote, we record a breakage
adjustment and reduce deferred revenue by the amount never expected to be redeemed. We use historic gift card redemption patterns to determine when the likelihood of a gift card's redemption becomes
remote and have determined that approximately 5% of the value of gift cards will never be redeemed. The methodology we use to match the expected redemption value of unredeemed gift cards to our
historic redemption patterns is to amortize the historic 5% rate of breakage over a three year period. As a result, the amount of unredeemed gift card liability included in deferred revenue is the
full value of unredeemed gift cards less the amortized portion of the 5% rate of breakage. We recorded our gift card breakage adjustment as a reduction of other operating expense. We review and adjust
our estimates on a quarterly basis. 
        We
franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurants. We execute franchise agreements for each franchise restaurant which sets out the terms of our arrangement with the franchisee. Our franchise
agreements typically require the franchisee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based upon a percentage of sales. Subject to our approval and payment of a renewal
fee, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration. We collect ongoing royalties of 2.0% to 4.0% of sales from domestic franchise restaurants. These ongoing royalties
are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as franchise royalties and fees. We recognize initial franchise fees as revenue after performing substantially all initial services
or conditions required by the
franchise agreement, which is generally upon the opening of a restaurant. We received initial franchise fees of $0.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2011, $0.1 million for
the year ended December 28, 2010 and$0.2 million for the year ended December 29, 2009. Continuing franchise royalties are recognized as revenue as the fees are earned. We also
perform supervisory and administrative services for certain franchise and license restaurants for which we receive management fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Revenue from
supervisory and administrative services is recorded as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of 
F-11

income.
Total revenue recorded for supervisory and administrative services for each of the years ended December 27, 2011, December 28, 2010, and December 29, 2009 was
approximately $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 
        Sales
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of
income. 

 (n)    Income Taxes  

        We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, under which
deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Any
change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 

 (o)    Advertising  

        We have a domestic system-wide marketing and advertising fund. We maintain control of the marketing and advertising fund
and, as such, have consolidated the fund's activity for the years ended December 27, 2011, December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009. Domestic company and franchise restaurants are
required to remit a designated portion of sales,
currently 0.3%, to the advertising fund. These reimbursements do not exceed the costs we incur throughout the year associated with various marketing programs which are developed internally by us.
Therefore, the net amount of the advertising costs incurred less amounts remitted by company and franchise restaurants is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements
of income. 
        The
company-owned restaurant contribution and other costs related to local restaurant area marketing initiatives are included in other operating costs in our consolidated statements of
income. These costs amounted to approximately $8.5 million, $7.7 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 27, 2011, December 28, 2010 and
December 29, 2009, respectively. 

 (p)    Leases and Leasehold Improvements  

        We lease land, buildings and/or certain equipment for the majority of our restaurants under non-cancelable lease
agreements. Our land and building leases typically have initial terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, and certain renewal options for one or more five-year periods. We account for
leases in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, and other related authoritative guidance. When determining the lease term, we include option periods for
which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such an amount that a renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. The primary penalty to which we are subject
is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might become impaired if we choose not to continue the use of the leased property. 
        Certain
of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent during the original term of the lease. For these leases, we recognize the related rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record the difference between the amounts charged to 
F-12

 (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
operations
and amounts paid as deferred rent. We generally do not receive rent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a restaurant that is subject to a lease. We may receive rent
holidays, which would begin on the possession date and end on the date construction of the restaurant begins, during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease. Rent
holidays are included in the lease term when determining straight-line rent expense. 
        Additionally,
certain of our operating leases contain clauses that provide for additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. We
recognize contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent, provided achievement of the target is considered probable. This may result in some
variability in rent expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent. 
        We
make judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday
and/or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized. These
judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used. 
        In
an exposure draft issued in 2010, the FASB, together with the International Accounting Standards Board, has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") for leases. 

 (q)    Use of Estimates  

        We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reporting of revenue and expenses during the period to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity
with GAAP. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, goodwill, obligations related to insurance reserves, income taxes and
share-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 (r)    Comprehensive Income  

        ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and presentation of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss) items that are excluded from net income
under GAAP in the United States. These items included net unrealized gains (losses) on securities and the effective unrealized portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges. 

 (s)    Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

        Fair value is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount
rates appropriate for the duration and considers counterparty performance risk.

 (t)    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  

        We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Currently, our only free standing current derivative instruments are two
interest rate swap agreements. 
        We
account for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether the
derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. Our current derivatives have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified
into earnings in the same period or period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized during the periods ended December 27, 2011,
December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009. 

 (u)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
Fair Value Measures and Disclosures
(ASU 2010-06)  

        In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06 which amends ASC topic 820, Fair Value Measures and
Disclosures. ASU No. 2010-06 amends the ASC to require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and
also requires more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. The changes as a result of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2009 (our 2010 fiscal year), except for requirements related to Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for annual and interim period beginning after
December 15, 2010 (our 2011 fiscal year). This guidance requires new disclosures only, and had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Comprehensive Income
(ASU 2011-05)  

        In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the
components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, which is our current presentation, and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments
from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date
for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011-05, to defer the effective date of the
specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income.
All other provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 (our 2012 fiscal year). The adoption of this new guidance had no
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, though it will change our financial statement presentation.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
(ASU 2011-08)  

        In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for
Impairment, which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value
before applying the two-step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place. If it is
determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary. The
qualitative assessment is optional, allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment. This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2011 (our 2012 fiscal year). We do not anticipate any changes to the content of our financial statements or disclosures as a result of adopting this guidance.

        The
weighted average interest rate for installment loans outstanding at December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 was 10.57% and 10.58%, respectively. The debt is secured by
certain land and buildings and is subject to certain prepayment penalties. 
        On
August 12, 2011, we entered into a new $200.0 million five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by JP Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., PNC Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo, N.A. This facility replaces our previous five-year revolving credit facility. The new facility expires

 (3) Long-term Debt and Obligations Under Capital Leases (Continued) 
on
August 12, 2016. The terms of the facility require us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.875%, depending on
our leverage ratio, or the Alternate Base Rate, which is the higher of the issuing bank's prime lending rate
or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.150% to 0.350% per year on any unused portion of the facility, depending on our leverage ratio. The
weighted-average interest rate for the revolver at both December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 was 3.20% and 3.59%, respectively, including interest rate swaps. At December 27,
2011, we had $60.0 million outstanding under the credit facility and $136.2 million of availability, net of $3.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
        The
lenders' obligation to extend credit under the facility depends on us maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to
1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the facility, except for the incurrence of
secured indebtedness that in the aggregate exceeds 20% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured indebtedness would prevent us from complying
with our financial covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 27, 2011. 
        On
October 22, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap, starting on November 7, 2008, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash
flows of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 3.83% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 1-month LIBOR rate for a term ending on November 7, 2015, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the
$25.0 million notional amount. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap will be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
        On
January 7, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap, starting on February 7, 2009, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash flows
of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 2.34% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 1-month LIBOR rate for a term ending on January 7, 2016, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the
$25.0 million notional amount. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap will be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

assets consist of reacquired franchise rights. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the intangible assets at December 27, 2011 were
$14.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively. We amortize reacquired franchise rights on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the franchise operating agreements,
which varies by restaurant. The weighted average amortization period of reacquired franchise rights is approximately 14 years. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected
to be $1.1 million. In 2011 and 2010, as a result of our goodwill and/or

        We,
consistent with our existing policy, recognize both interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. As of December 27, 2011, the total
amount of accrued penalties and interest related to uncertain tax provisions was immaterial. As of December 28, 2010, the total amount of accrued penalties and interest related to uncertain tax
provisions was $0.1 million. Included

in
the balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 27, 2011 are no potential benefits, which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 
        All
entities for which unrecognized tax benefits exist as of December 27, 2011 possess a December tax year-end. As a result, as of December 27, 2011, the tax
years ended December 30, 2008, December 29, 2009 and December 28, 2010 remain subject to examination by all tax jurisdictions. As of December 27, 2011, no audits were in
process by a tax jurisdiction that, if completed during the next twelve months, would be expected to result in a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits. Additionally, as of
December 27, 2011, no event occurred that is likely to result in a significant increase or decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits through December 26, 2012. 
 (8) Preferred Stock  

        Our Board of Directors is authorized, without further vote or action by the holders of common stock, to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock
in one or more series. Each series of preferred stock will have the number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors, which may include, but are not limited to, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and
preemptive rights. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010. 
 (9) Stockholders' Equity  

        On February 14, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. On
July 8, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a $50.0 million increase in our stock repurchase program. Our total stock repurchase authorization increased to $75.0 million. On
November 19, 2009, the Board of Directors extended the expiration date on the stock repurchase program to February 14, 2011. 
        On
February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. On
August 18, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $50.0 million increase in our stock repurchase program. On February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors cancelled this stock
repurchase program, which had to expiration date and $40.9 million remaining as of December 27, 2011 and approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized us to repurchase up
to $100.0 million of our common stock. Any repurchases will be made through open market transactions. The timing and the amount of any repurchases will be determined by management under
parameters established by our Board of Directors, based on its evaluation of our stock price, market conditions and other corporate considerations. See note 18. 
        For
the years ended December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock; however, for the year ended December 27, 2011, we
paid approximately $59.1 million to repurchase 3,972,100 shares of our common stock.

 (10) Earnings Per Share  

        The share and net income per share data for all periods presented are based on the historical weighted-average shares outstanding. The diluted earnings per share calculations show the
effect of the weighted-average stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding from our equity incentive plan as discussed in note 12. For the years ended December 27, 2011,
December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009, options to purchase 521,512, 1,798,911 and 2,861,892 shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net
income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect. For the year ended December 27, 2011, an immaterial number of shares of nonvested stock were
outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect. For the years ended December 28, 2010
and December 29, 2009, 16,546 and 18,475 shares of nonvested stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their inclusion
would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

        The estimated cost of completing capital project commitments at December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010 was approximately $58.6 million and $52.8 million,
respectively. 
        We
entered into real estate lease agreements for franchise restaurants located in Everett, MA, Longmont, CO, Montgomeryville, PA, Fargo, ND and Logan, UT before granting franchise rights
for those restaurants. We have subsequently assigned the leases to the franchisees, but remain contingently liable if a franchisee defaults, under the terms of the lease. The Longmont lease was
assigned in October 2003 and expires in May 2014, the Everett lease was assigned in September 2002 and expires

in
February 2018, the Montgomeryville lease was assigned in October 2004 and expires in June 2021,the Fargo lease was assigned in February 2006 and expires in July 2016 and the Logan lease was
assigned in January 2009 and expires in August 2019. As the fair value of the guarantees is not considered significant, no liability has been recorded. As discussed in note 17, the Everett, MA,
Longmont, CO, and Fargo, ND restaurants are owned, in whole or part, by certain officers, directors and 5% stockholders of the Company. 
        During
the year ended December 27, 2011, we bought most of our beef from three suppliers. Although there are a limited number of beef suppliers, we believe that other suppliers
could provide similar product on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause supply shortages and a possible loss of sales, which would affect operating results adversely. We have no
material minimum purchase commitments with our vendors that extend beyond a year. 
        On
September 30, 2011, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") filed a lawsuit titled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Texas
Roadhouse, Inc., Texas Roadhouse Holdings LLC, Texas Roadhouse Management Corp. in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
Number 1:11-cv-11732. The complaint alleges that we engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination in hiring for certain restaurant positions in violation of
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The complaint alleges that applicants over the age of 40 were denied employment in our restaurants in bartender, host, server and server assistant positions
due to their age. The EEOC is seeking injunctive relief, remedial actions, payment of damages to the applicants and costs. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims made by the EEOC, and
we intend to vigorously defend against them. Based on the preliminary status of this matter, we cannot estimate the possible amount or range of loss, if any, associated with this matter. 
        On
January 19, 2011, a civil case styled as a class action complaint titled Jenna Crenshaw, Andrew Brickley, et al, and all others similarly situated v.
Texas Roadhouse, Inc., Texas Roadhouse Holdings, LLC, Texas Roadhouse of Everett, LLC and Texas Roadhouse Management Corp., d/b/a Texas Roadhouse
("Crenshaw") was filed. The complaint was subsequently amended to add additional plaintiffs. The complaint is pending in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
Number 1:11-cv-10549. The complaint alleges a failure to comply with Massachusetts labor laws, specifically that we improperly shared pooled tips with ineligible
employees in all of our restaurants in Massachusetts. Currently, we operate nine restaurants in the state. We have filed an answer denying all material allegations and are in the early phases of
discovery. Additionally, we have agreed to participate in mediation. 
        We
believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the Crenshaw case, and we intend to vigorously defend against them, including plaintiffs' efforts to certify a class
action. Based on the preliminary status of this matter, specifically that no class has been certified, we cannot estimate the possible amount or range of loss, if any, associated with this matter.
However, if the court imposes statutory penalties, including restitution of the difference between the tip credit wage and minimum wage, restitution of tips, treble damages and attorneys' fees, then
the case could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows.

 (12) Share-based Compensation  

        In May 2004, we adopted an equity incentive plan (the "Plan") for eligible participants. This Plan amended and restated the 1997 Texas Roadhouse Management Corp. Stock Option Plan. The
Plan provides for granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock, stock bonus awards (restricted stock unit awards ("RSUs")) and restricted stock
awards. The Plan provides for the issuance of 16,000,000 shares of common stock plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of the year for a period of ten years, commencing on
January 1, 2005 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2014, equal to the lesser of one percent of the shares of common stock outstanding or 1,000,000 shares of common stock. Options
are exercisable at various periods ranging from one to ten years from the date of grant. Beginning in 2008, we changed the method by which we provide share-based compensation to our employees by
eliminating stock option grants and, instead, granting RSUs as a form of share-based compensation. An RSU is the conditional right to receive one share of common stock upon satisfaction of the
service-based vesting requirement.

 (13) Fair Value Measurement  

        ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes
a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize

 (13) Fair Value Measurement (Continued) 
the
use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. 











 Level 1
 
Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.


 Level 2
 
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets, either directly or indirectly.


 Level 3
 
Inputs that are unobservable for the asset.




        There
were no transfers among levels within the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 27, 2011.

        The
fair value of our interest rate swaps were determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including nonperformance risk, and
using discount rates appropriate for the duration. See note 15 for discussion of our interest rate swaps. 
        The
Second Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan of Texas Roadhouse Management Corp., as amended, (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") is a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan which allows highly compensated employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and contribute such amounts to one or more investment funds held in a rabbi trust. We report the
accounts of the rabbi trust in our consolidated financial statements. These investments are considered trading securities and are reported at fair value based on third-party broker statements. The
realized and unrealized holding gains and losses related to these investments, as well as the offsetting compensation expense, are recorded in general and administrative expense on the consolidated
statements of income.

 (13) Fair Value Measurement (Continued) 
        Long-lived
assets held for sale include land and building and are valued using Level 2 inputs, primarily independent third party appraisal. These assets are included
in Property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets as we do not expect to sell these assets in the next 12 months. Cost to market and/or sell the assets are factored into the
estimates of fair value. During the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2011, long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying amount of $1.6 million were written down to their
fair value of $1.4 million, resulting in a loss of $0.2 million, which is included in Impairment and closures in our consolidated statements of income. 
        Long-lived
assets held for use include building, equipment and furniture and fixtures and are valued using Level 2 inputs, primarily an independent third party
appraisal. These assets are included in Property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets. During the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2009, long-lived assets held for use
with a carrying amount of $2.5 million were written down to their fair value of $1.2 million, resulting in a loss of $1.3 million, which is included in Impairment and closures in
our consolidated statements of income. Depreciation expense of $0.1 million was recorded on these assets during the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2011. 
        As
of December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010, goodwill in the table above relates to two and three underperforming restaurants, respectively, in which the carrying value
of the associated goodwill was reduced to fair value, based on their historical results and anticipated future trends of operations. These charges are included in Impairment and closures in our
consolidated statements of income. For further discussion of impairment charges, see note 14. 
        At
December 27, 2011 and December 28, 2010, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their carrying value based on
the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the current rates offered to us for instruments of similar terms and
maturities. The carrying amounts and related estimated fair values for our debt is as follows:

 (14) Impairment and Closure Costs  

        During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $2.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to goodwill and
long-lived assets. These charges were measured and recognized following current accounting guidance which requires that the carrying value of these assets be tested for impairment whenever
circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, or at least annually in the case of goodwill. Refer to note 2 for further discussion of the methodology used by us to test for
long-lived asset and goodwill impairment. 
        Impairment
charges in 2011 included $0.8 million associated with the impairment of goodwill related to one restaurant and the $0.4 million related to the
write-down of land, building, equipment and furniture and fixtures and ongoing closure costs associated with one restaurant closed in 2008. The

goodwill
impairment charges in 2011 resulted from our annual testing which relies, in part, on the historical trends and anticipated future trends of operations of individual restaurants. 
        Impairment
charges in 2010 included $1.7 million associated with the impairment of goodwill related to four restaurants and $0.2 million related to the
write-down of equipment and ongoing closure costs associated with one restaurant, which was closed in 2010. The remaining $0.1 million in expenses were ongoing closure costs
associated with one restaurant closed in 2008. 
        Impairment
charges in 2009 included $1.9 million related to four underperforming restaurants in which the carrying value of the associated goodwill and reacquired franchise rights
were reduced to fair value, based on their historical results and anticipated future trends of operations. Of the $1.9 million impairment charge, $0.6 million was not deductible for tax
purposes. For further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets, refer to note 6. 
        Impairment
charges in 2009 also included $1.3 million related to one underperforming restaurant in which its carrying value was reduced to its estimated fair value, based on its
historical results and anticipated future trends of operations. The impairment included building and equipment. In addition, in 2009, we recorded a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of
one restaurant which was relocated, a charge of $0.5 million in conjunction with the closure of one restaurant, and recognized a credit of $0.1 million related to the settlement of a
lease reserve associated with one restaurant which was closed in 2008. 
 (15) Derivative and Hedging Activities  

        We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815").
We use interest rate-related derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations of interest rates. By using these instruments, we expose ourselves, from time to time, to credit
risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty
owes us, which creates credit risk for us. We minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis.
Our counterparty in the interest rate swaps is JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates,
commodity prices, or the market price of our common stock. We minimize market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be taken. 
Interest
Rate Swaps 
        On
October 22, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap, starting on November 7, 2008, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge
a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to
interest payments on a $25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under its revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 3.83% on the
$25.0 million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 
F-28

1-month
LIBOR rate for a term ending on November 7, 2015, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the $25.0 million notional amount. 
        On
January 7, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap, starting on February 7, 2009, with a notional amount of $25.0 million to hedge a portion of the cash flows
of our variable rate credit facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a
$25.0 million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the swap, we pay a fixed rate of 2.34% on the $25.0 million notional amount
and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 1-month LIBOR rate for a term ending on January 7, 2016, effectively resulting in a fixed rate LIBOR component of the
$25.0 million notional amount. 
        We
entered into the above interest rate swaps with the objective of eliminating the variability of our interest expense that arises because of changes in the variable interest rate for
the designated interest payments. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap will be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We will reclassify any gain or loss
from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, on our consolidated balance sheet to interest expense on our consolidated statement of income when the interest rate swap expires or at the
time we choose to terminate the swap. See note 13 for fair value discussion of these interest rate swaps.

 (16) Related Party Transactions  

        The Longview, Texas restaurant, which was acquired by us in connection with the completion of our initial public offering, leases the land and restaurant building from an entity
controlled by Steven L. Ortiz, our Chief Operating Officer. The lease term is for 15 years and will terminate in November 2014. The lease can be renewed for two additional terms of five
years each. Rent is approximately $19,000 per month. The lease can be terminated if the tenant fails to pay the rent on a timely basis, fails to maintain the insurance specified in the lease, fails to
maintain the building or property or becomes insolvent. Total rent payments were approximately $224,000 for both 2011 and 2010. 
        The
Bossier City, Louisiana restaurant, of which Steven L. Ortiz beneficially owns 66.0% and we own 5.0%, leases the land and building from an entity owned by Mr. Ortiz. The lease
term is 15 years and will terminate on March 31, 2020. Rent is approximately $16,600 per month and escalates 10% each five years during the term. The next rent escalation is in the
second quarter of 2015. The lease can be terminated if the tenant fails to pay rent on a timely basis, fails to maintain insurance, abandons the property or becomes insolvent. Total rent payments were
approximately $199,000 and $193,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        We
have 15 license and franchise restaurants owned in whole or part by certain officers, directors and stockholders of the Company at December 27, 2011, December 28, 2010
and December 29, 2009. These entities paid us fees of $2.2 million, $2.1 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 27, 2011,
December 28, 2010 and December 29, 2009, respectively. As discussed in note 11, we are contingently liable on leases which are related to three of these restaurants. 
        On
August 17, 2011, we entered into an agreement with G.J. Hart, our former President and Chief Executive Officer whereby Mr. Hart will provide consulting services to us
from August 17, 2011 through January 2, 2012. In consideration of the services to be performed by Mr. Hart, our Board of Directors accelerated the vesting of a grant of 60,000
restricted stock units from January 7, 2012 to January 2, 2012. The agreement also provides for partial payment of health insurance premiums through December 31, 2011.

 (18) Subsequent Events  

        On February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the payment of a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of common stock. This payment will be distributed on March 30,
2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2012. 
        Also
on February 16, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our common stock.
Any repurchases will be made through open market transactions. The timing and the amount of any repurchases will be determined by management under parameters established by our Board of Directors,
based on its evaluation of our stock price, market conditions and other corporate considerations. Our Board of Directors cancelled the previous stock repurchase program, which had no expiration date
and $40.9 million remaining as of December 27, 2011.
