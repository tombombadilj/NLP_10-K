Business Description of Business The registrant, South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI), a New Jersey corporation, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of owning and holding all of the outstanding common stock of South Jersey Gas Company, a public utility, and acquiring and developing non-utility lines of business. SJI currently provides a variety of energy related products and services primarily through the following subsidiaries: •South Jersey Gas Company (SJG) is a regulated natural gas utility. SJG distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey. •South Jersey Resources Group, LLC (SJRG) markets wholesale natural gas storage, commodity and transportation in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.•South Jersey Exploration, LLC (SJEX) owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.  SJEX was a wholly owned subsidiary of SJRG until November 2011, when it became a wholly owned subsidiary of South Jersey Energy Solutions, LLC (SJES). •Marina Energy, LLC (Marina) develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. •South Jersey Energy Company (SJE) acquires and markets natural gas and electricity to retail end users and provides total energy management services to commercial and industrial customers. •South Jersey Energy Service Plus, LLC (SJESP) installs and services residential and small commercial HVAC systems, provides plumbing services and services appliances under warranty via a subcontractor arrangement as well as on a time and materials basis. Additional Information on the nature of our business can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under Item 7 of this report. Financial Information About Reportable Segments Information regarding Reportable Segments is incorporated by reference to Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials South Jersey Gas Company Transportation and Storage Agreements SJG has direct connections to the interstate natural gas pipeline systems of both Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC (Columbia). During 2011, SJG purchased and had delivered approximately 37.7 million decatherms (MMdts) of natural gas for distribution to both on-system and off-system customers. Of this total, 22.7 MMdts were transported on the Transco pipeline system while 15.0 MMdts were transported on the Columbia pipeline system.  Moreover, during 2011 third-party suppliers delivered 30.3 MMdts to SJG's system on behalf of end use customers behind our city gate stations.  SJG also secures firm transportation and other long term services from one additional pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems. This upstream pipeline is owned by Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion). Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Columbia systems for ultimate delivery to SJG. Services provided by all of the above-mentioned pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Unless otherwise indicated, our intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.2South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part I Transco: Transco is SJG's largest supplier of long-term gas transmission services which includes both year-round and seasonal firm transportation (FT) service arrangements. When combined, these FT services enable SJG to purchase gas from third parties and have delivered to its city gate stations by Transco a total of 280,525 dts per day (dts/d). Of this total, 133,917 dts/d is long-haul FT (where gas can be transported from the production areas of the Southwest to the market areas of the Northeast) while 146,608 dts/d is market area FT. The terms of SJG's year-round agreements extend for various periods through 2025. The terms of its seasonal agreements vary in length with the longest extending into 2012. Of the 280,525 dts/d of Transco services mentioned above, SJG has released a total of 39,800 dts/d of its long-haul FT and 25,565 dts/d of its market area FT service.  These releases were made in association with SJG's Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) discussed further under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  In addition, SJG released 90,000 dts/d of market area FT service to SJRG as part of an Asset Management Agreement discussed further in this section under “Gas Supplies”.SJG currently has six long-term gas storage service agreements with Transco that, when combined, are capable of storing approximately 5.0 MMdts. Through these agreements, SJG can inject gas into market and production area storages during periods of low demand and extract gas at a Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity (MDWQ) of up to 107,407 dts during periods of high demand. The longest term of these storage service agreements extends through 2013.  Dominion:SJG subscribes to a firm storage service from Dominion, under its Rate Schedule GSS.  This storage has a MDWQ of 10,000 dts during the period between November 16 and March 31 of each winter season, with an associated total storage capacity of 423,000 dts.  Gas withdrawn from Dominion GSS storage is delivered through both the Dominion and Transco (Leidy Line) pipeline systems for delivery to SJG service territory.  The primary term of this agreement extends through March 31, 2015. Columbia: Entering 2011, SJG had two firm transportation agreements with Columbia which, at the time, provided for 45,022 dts/d of firm deliverability with each extending through October 31, 2019.  In 2011, SJG secured a third firm transportation agreement with Columbia for an incremental 9,000 dts/d of capacity, the primary term of which extends through October 2012.  When combined, these three agreements provide SJG with a total of 54,022 dts/d of firm transportation rights on Columbia.  SJG had previously released 14,714 dts/d of this amount to SJRG in conjunction with its CIP thereby reducing the combined availability of firm transportation on the Columbia system to 30,308 dts/d.  These releases made by SJG were in connection with its CIP and extend through September 30, 2014.SJG also subscribes to a firm storage service with Columbia under its Rate Schedule FSS along with an associated firm transportation service under Rate Schedule SST, each of which extends through October 31, 2019.  The Company has a total FSS MDWQ of 52,891 dts and with a related 3,473,022 dts of storage capacity.  SJG released to SJRG 19,029 dts of its FSS MDWQ  along with 1,249,485 dts of its FSS storage capacity.  Additionally, SJG also released to SJRG 19,029 dts/d of its Columbia SST transportation service.  Both releases made by SJG were in connection with its CIP and extend through September 30, 2014. Gas Supplies SJG has an Asset Management Agreement (AMA) with SJRG that extends through November 30, 2013.  Under this agreement SJG has released to SJRG its firm transportation rights equal to 90,000 dts/d of transportation capacity on Transco.  SJRG will manage this capacity and provide SJG with up to 90,000 dts/d of firm deliverability in the summer season and up to 90,000 dts/d of interruptible deliverability in the winter season.  SJRG will seek to optimize the capacity released under this AMA and will pay SJG a fee based on a sharing formula in the agreement.  In 2011, SJG entered into a long-term gas purchase agreement with Antero Resources Appalachian Corporation (Antero) the primary term of which extends through October 31, 2019.  The maximum daily quantities (MDQ) available for purchase under this agreement initially starts at 6,250 dts/d and ratchets up to a MDQ of 25,000 dts/d.  Gas purchased from Antero will be sourced in the Appalachian supply areas and delivered into the Columbia pipeline system for delivery to SJG. 3South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IDue to increased liquidity in the market place, all other gas supply agreements with third party suppliers are short-term agreements and SJG uses financial contracts secured through SJRG to hedge against forward price risk.  Short-term agreements typically extend between one day and several months in duration. Supplemental Gas Supplies During 2011, SJG entered into two seasonal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) sales agreements with a third party supplier. The term of the first agreement, which was used during the 2011 summer season to refill SJG's storage tank, extended through October 31, 2011, and had an associated contract quantity of 210,000 dts. The second agreement was acquired to replenish LNG in storage during the 2011-2012 winter season.  This agreement extends through March 31, 2012 and also provides SJG with up to 310,000 dts of LNG. SJG operates peaking facilities which can store and vaporize LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system. Peak-Day Supply SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit (F). Gas demand on such a design day for the 2011-2012 winter season is estimated to be 458,180 dts. SJG projects that it has adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet its design requirements. SJG experienced its highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2011 of 414,100 dts on January 23rd while experiencing an average temperature of 18.2 degrees F that day. Natural Gas Prices SJG's average cost of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2011, 2010 and 2009, including demand charges,  was $6.11 per dt, $6.64 per dt and $8.38 per dt, respectively. South Jersey Energy Company Transportation and Storage Agreements - Natural Gas Access to gas suppliers and cost of gas are significant to the operations of SJE. No material part of the business of SJE is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. SJE purchases delivered gas only, primarily from SJRG. Consequently, SJE maintains no transportation or storage agreements. Electric Supply Due to the liquidity in the market, SJE primarily purchases delivered electric in the day-ahead and real time markets through regional transmission organizations and consequently does not own or operate any generation or transmission assets. South Jersey Resources Group Transportation and Storage Agreements National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation: SJRG has multiple storage service agreements with National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel). Two contracts totaling 2,581,420 dts of capacity have evergreen rights that extend year to year.  One additional contract covering 224,576 dts of storage capacity extends through March 31, 2018 while a final contract covering 150,040 dts of capacity expires March 31, 2023.  SJRG holds long term firm transportation agreements with National Fuel associated with the above-mentioned agreements. Under these agreements, National Fuel will provide SJRG with a maximum daily injection transportation quantity of 16,947 dts/d with primary receipt points from Tennessee Gas Pipeline for delivery into storage, and 25,661 dts/d of maximum daily withdrawal transportation quantity with a primary receipt point of storage and a primary delivery point of Transcontinental Gas Pipeline.4South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part I Transcontinental Gas Pipeline: SJRG has a storage agreement with Transco for storage service at Transco's WSS facility which expires in October 2017. Under this evergreen contract, up to 24,479 dts/d may be injected and up to 46,380 dts/d may be withdrawn. Total storage capacity on the agreement is 4,406,135 dts.SJRG also has two firm transportation agreements with Transco which expire September 30, 2013. Under these contracts, Transco will provide SJRG with receipts at various production points in Texas and Louisiana and deliveries in New Jersey totaling 19,900 dts/d.  This service was released to SJRG by SJG as discussed above. Dominion Gas Transmission: SJRG has a firm transportation agreement with Dominion which expires October 31, 2022. Under this agreement, Dominion will provide SJRG with 5,000 dts/d of deliveries to Leidy, Pennsylvania and receipts at Lebanon, Ohio. SJRG also has a firm transportation agreement with Dominion related to SJRG's Transco SS-1 storage. Under this contract, Dominion will provide receipts at Leidy, Pennsylvania and deliveries to storage in the amount of 17,432 dts/d.  This service was released to SJRG by SJG in 2008. Columbia Gas Transmission: SJRG holds a firm transportation agreement with Columbia. Under this evergreen agreement, Columbia provides receipts at Leach, Kentucky and deliveries of 14,714 dts/d to New Jersey.  In addition, SJRG has 10,000 dts/d of Columbia capacity from New York to Maryland expiring October 31, 2018.  These services with Columbia were released to SJRG by SJG as discussed above. SJRG holds a storage agreement with Columbia for service under Columbia's FSS rate schedule. Under this evergreen agreement, Columbia will provide SJRG with storage capacity of 1,249,515 dts. Under this agreement, 19,029 dts/d may be withdrawn from storage and 9,996 dts/d may be injected. SJRG holds firm transportation related to the above mentioned storage agreement which provides for receipts at storage and deliveries to New Jersey of 19,029 dts/d. Under this evergreen contract,these services with Columbia were released to SJRG by SJG as discussed above. Columbia Gulf Transmission: SJRG holds a firm transportation agreement with Columbia Gulf which expires October 31, 2019. Under this evergreen agreement, Columbia provides receipts in Louisiana with deliveries at Leach, Kentucky in the amount of 15,000 dts/d.    Tennessee Gas Transmission: SJRG holds a firm transportation agreement with Tennessee Gas Pipeline which expires October 31, 2012.  Under this agreement, Tennessee provides receipts from Niagara, New York and deliveries in New England in the amount of 25,000 dts/d.Millennium: SJRG holds a firm transportation agreement with Millennium Pipeline which expire October 31, 2012.  Under this agreement, Millennium provides receipts and deliveries in New York in the amount of 9,580 dts/d. Gas Supplies               SJRG has entered into several long-term natural gas supply agreements to purchase a minimum of 340,000 dts/d and up to 700,000 dts/d, depending upon production levels, for terms ranging from three to ten years at index based prices.  Further, SJG released 90,000 dts/d of market area FT service to SJRG as part of an AMA agreement discussed above. 5South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IPatents and Franchises South Jersey Gas Company SJG holds nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the seven-county area of southern New Jersey that it serves. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by SJG's franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of SJG. Seasonal Aspects South Jersey Gas Company SJG experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. SJG meets this seasonal fluctuation in demand from its firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, SJG's revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year. Non-Utility Companies Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale and retail gas marketing have seasonal patterns similar to SJG's. Activities such as energy services and energy project development do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities such as retail electric marketing and appliance service can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the utility. While growth in the earnings contributions from nonutility operations has improved SJI's second and third quarter net income levels, the first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced. Working Capital Practices Reference is made to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this report. Customers No material part of the Company's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on SJI performance on a consolidated basis. One of SJI's subsidiaries, Marina Energy, does currently receive the majority of its revenues from one customer. However, that customer is under a long-term contract through 2027. Backlog Backlog is not material to an understanding of SJI's business or that of any of its subsidiaries. Government Contracts No material portion of the business of SJI or any of its subsidiaries is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government. Competition Information on competition for SJI and its subsidiaries can be found in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this report. Research During the last three fiscal years, neither SJI nor any of its subsidiaries engaged in research activities to any material extent.6South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part I Environmental Matters Information on environmental matters for SJI and its subsidiaries can be found in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Employees SJI and its subsidiaries had a total of approximately 675 employees as of December 31, 2011. Of that total, approximately 330 employees are unionized.  The Company has collective bargaining agreements with two unions that represent these employees: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1293 and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Local 76.  SJG and SJESP employees represented by the IBEW operate under a collective bargaining agreement that runs through February 2013, with the option to extend until February 2014 at the union's election.  The remaining unionized employees represented by the IAM operate under a collective bargaining agreement that expires in August 2014. Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales SJI has no foreign operations and export sales have not been a significant part of SJI's business.Item 1A. Risk Factors SJI and its subsidiaries operate in an environment that involves risks, many of which are beyond our control. SJI has identified the following risk factors that could cause SJI's operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and SJI cannot predict those risks or the extent to which they may affect SJI's businesses or financial performance. •SJI is a holding company and its assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Should SJI's subsidiaries be unable to pay dividends or make other payments to SJI for financial, regulatory, legal or other reasons, SJI's ability to pay dividends on its common stock could be limited. SJI's stock price could be adversely affected as a result.•SJI's business activities are concentrated in southern New Jersey. Changes in the economies of southern New Jersey and surrounding regions could negatively impact the growth opportunities available to SJI and the financial condition of customers and prospects of SJI.•Changes in the regulatory environment or unfavorable rate regulation at its utility may have an unfavorable impact on SJI's financial performance or condition.  SJI's utility business is regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities which has authority over many of the activities of the business including, but not limited to, the rates it charges to its customers, the amount and type of securities it can issue, the nature of investments it can make, the nature and quality of services it provides, safety standards and other matters. The extent to which the actions of regulatory commissions restrict or delay SJG's ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital and/or fully recover operating costs may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•SJI may not be able to respond effectively to competition, which may negatively impact SJI's financial performance or condition. Regulatory initiatives may provide or enhance opportunities for competitors that could reduce utility income obtained from existing or prospective customers. Also, competitors in all of SJI's business lines may be able to provide superior or less costly products or services based upon currently available or newly developed technologies.•Warm weather, high commodity costs, or customer conservation initiatives could result in reduced demand for some of SJI's energy products and services. While SJI's utility currently has a conservation incentive program clause that protects its revenues and gross margin against usage per customer that is lower than a set level, the clause is currently approved as a pilot program through 2013. Should this clause expire without replacement, lower customer energy utilization levels would likely reduce SJI's net income.•High natural gas prices could cause more of SJI's receivables to be uncollectible. Higher levels of uncollectibles from either residential or commercial customers would negatively impact SJI's income and could result in higher working capital requirements.•SJI's net income could decrease if it is required to incur additional costs to comply with new governmental safety, health or environmental legislation. SJI is subject to extensive and changing federal and state laws and regulations that impact many aspects of its business; including the storage, transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the remediation of environmental contamination at former manufactured gas plant facilities.7South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part I• Climate change legislation could impact SJI's financial performance and condition.  Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike.  The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of this change and its future impacts.  Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions.  These actions could affect the demand for natural gas and electricity, result in increased costs to our business and impact the prices we charge our customers. Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with low carbon content, it is possible that future carbon constraints could create additional demands for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses.  Any adoption by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry.  We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.•SJI's wholesale commodity marketing business is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe money or energy to SJI will not be able to meet their obligations for operational or financial reasons. SJI could be forced to buy or sell commodity at a loss as a result of such failure. Such a failure, if large enough, could also impact SJI's liquidity.•Increasing interest rates will negatively impact the net income of SJI. Several of SJI's subsidiaries are capital intensive, resulting in the incurrence of significant amounts of debt financing. SJI has issued almost all of its existing long-term debt at fixed rates or has utilized interest rate swaps to mitigate changes in variable rates.  However, new issues of long-term debt and all variable rate short-term debt are exposed to the impact of rising interest rates.•SJI has guaranteed certain obligations of unconsolidated affiliates and is exposed to the risk that these affiliates will not be able to meet performance and financial commitments.  SJI's unconsolidated affiliates develop and operate on-site energy related projects.  SJI has guaranteed certain obligations of these affiliates in connection with the development and operation of the facilities.  In the event that these projects do not meet specified levels of operating performance or are unable to meet certain financial obligations as they become due, SJI could be required to make payments related to these obligations.•The inability to obtain capital, particularly short-term capital from commercial banks, could negatively impact the daily operations and financial performance of SJI. SJI uses short-term borrowings under committed and uncommitted credit facilities provided by commercial banks to supplement cash provided by operations, to support working capital needs, and to finance capital expenditures, as incurred. SJG relies upon short-term borrowings issued under a commercial paper program supported by a committed bank credit facility to support working capital needs, and to finance capital expenditures, as incurred. If the customary sources of short-term capital were no longer available due to market conditions, SJI and its subsidiaries may not be able to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and borrowing costs could increase.•A downgrade in either SJI's or SJG's credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access adequate and cost effective capital. Our ability to obtain adequate and cost effective capital depends largely on our credit ratings, which are greatly influenced by financial condition and results of operations. If the rating agencies downgrade either SJI's or SJG's credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future financings and potential funding sources would likely decrease. To the extent that a decline in SJG's credit rating has a negative effect on SJI, SJI could be required to provide additional support to certain counterparties of the wholesale energy operations.•Hedging activities of the company designed to protect against commodity price or interest rate risk may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and SJI's stock price could be adversely affected as a result. Although SJI enters into various contracts to hedge the value of energy assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions, the timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America does not always match up with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.•The inability to obtain natural gas would negatively impact the financial performance of SJI. Several of SJI's subsidiaries have businesses based upon the ability to deliver natural gas to customers. Disruption in the production of natural gas or transportation of that gas to SJI from its suppliers, could prevent SJI from completing sales to its customers.8South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part I•Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. SJI's gas distribution activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, mechanical problems, natural disasters or terrorist activities which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, SJI maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect SJI's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.•Adverse results in legal proceedings could be detrimental to the financial condition of SJI. The outcomes of legal proceedings can be unpredictable and can result in adverse judgments.•Renewable energy projects at Marina receive significant benefit from tax and regulatory incentives. A significant portion of the expected return on investment of these renewable energy projects is dependent upon federal investment tax credits (ITCs) and the future market for renewable energy credits (RECs). The benefits from ITCs are typically available when the project is placed in service while the benefits from RECs are produced during the entire life of the project. As a result, earnings from existing projects would be adversely affected without a liquid REC market. In addition, the return on investment from new projects may not be as attractive if ITCs are not available and/or a liquid REC market ceases to exist.  Therefore, these projects are exposed to the risk that currently favorable tax and regulatory incentives expire or are adversely modified.•Constraints in available pipeline capacity, particularly in the Marcellus Shale producing region, may negatively impact SJI's financial performance. Increasing natural gas production and/or pipeline transportation disruptions in the Marcellus region, where SJI has natural gas receipt requirements, may cause temporary take-away constraints resulting in higher transportation costs and the sale of shale gas at a loss.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  None.Item 2. Properties The principal property of SJI consists of SJG's gas transmission and distribution systems that include mains, service connections and meters. The transmission facilities carry the gas from the connections with Transco and Columbia to SJG's distribution systems for delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 124 miles of mains in the transmission systems and 6,020 miles of mains in the distribution systems. SJG owns approximately 154 acres of land in Folsom, New Jersey which is the site of SJI's corporate headquarters. Approximately 140 acres of this property is deed restricted. SJG also has office and service buildings at six other locations in the territory. There is a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporization facility at one of these locations. As of December 31, 2011, SJG's utility plant had a gross book value of $1.5 billion and a net book value, after accumulated depreciation, of $1.2 billion. In 2011, $142.6 million was spent on additions to utility plant and there were retirements of property having an aggregate gross book cost of $12.4 million. Virtually all of SJG's transmission pipeline, distribution mains and service connections are under streets or highways or on the property of others. The transmission and distribution systems are maintained under franchises or permits or rights-of-way, many of which are perpetual. SJG's properties (other than property specifically excluded) are subject to a lien of mortgage under which its first mortgage bonds are outstanding. We believe these properties are well maintained and in good operating condition. Nonutility property and equipment with a net book value of $194.4 million consists primarily of Marina's energy projects, in particular the thermal energy plant in Atlantic City, N.J. Energy and Minerals Inc. (EMI) owns 235 acres of land in Vineland, New Jersey. South Jersey Fuel, Inc., an inactive subsidiary, owns land in Deptford Township and owns real estate in Upper Township, New Jersey. R&T Castellini, Inc., an inactive subsidiary, owns land and buildings in Vineland, New Jersey.9South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IItem 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business and other legal proceedings. The Company has been named in, among other actions, certain product liability claims related to our former sand mining subsidiary. We accrue liabilities related to these claims when we can reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of probable settlement costs or other charges for these claims. The Company has accrued approximately $2.9 million and $4.2 million related to all claims in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a material change in the Company's estimated liability in the near term and does not currently anticipate the disposition of any known claims that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Item 4.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of OperationsOVERVIEW - South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company) is an energy services holding company that provides a variety of products and services through the following wholly owned subsidiaries:South Jersey Gas Company (SJG)SJG, a New Jersey corporation, is an operating public utility company engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial use. SJG also sells natural gas and pipeline transportation capacity (off-system sales) on a wholesale basis to various customers on the interstate pipeline system and transports natural gas purchased directly from producers or suppliers to their customers. SJG contributed approximately 59.2% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis in 2011.SJG's service territory covers approximately 2,500 square miles in the southern part of New Jersey. It includes 112 municipalities throughout Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties, with an estimated permanent population of 1.2 million. SJG benefits from its proximity to Philadelphia, PA and Wilmington, DE on the western side of its service territory and Atlantic City, NJ and the popular shore communities on the eastern side. Continuing expansion of our infrastructure throughout our seven-county region has fueled annual customer growth and creates opportunities for future extension into areas not yet served by natural gas. In the past, economic growth in Atlantic City and the surrounding region has been primarily driven by new and proposed gaming and non-gaming investments that emphasize destination style attractions. While many of these new projects were suspended or postponed due to the current economic environment, construction activity has resumed in Atlantic City, most notably on a new entertainment resort expected to open in April 2012. Combining with the gaming industry catalyst is the ongoing transition of southern New Jersey's oceanfront communities from seasonal resorts to year round economies.  Building expansions in the medical, hospitality and education sectors throughout the service territory have contributed to SJG's growth. Presently, SJG serves approximately 67% of households within its territory with natural gas. SJG also serves southern New Jersey's diversified industrial base that includes processors of petroleum and agricultural products; chemical, glass and consumer goods manufacturers; and high technology industrial parks.As of December 31, 2011, SJG served 351,304 residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey, compared with 347,725 customers at December 31, 2010.  No material part of SJG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales, transportation and capacity release for 2011 amounted to 128.1 MMdts (million dekatherms), of which 54.9 MMdts were firm sales and transportation, 1.8 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation and 71.4 MMdts were off-system sales and capacity release. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 41.3% residential, 20.3% commercial, 24.3% industrial, and 14.1% cogeneration and electric generation. At year-end 2011, SJG served 327,678 residential customers, 23,169 commercial customers and 457 industrial customers.  This includes 2011 net additions of 3,432 residential customers and 159 commercial customers.SJG makes wholesale gas sales to gas marketers for resale and ultimate delivery to end users. These “off-system” sales are made possible through the issuance of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Orders No. 547 and 636. Order No. 547 issued a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing all parties, which are not interstate pipelines, to make FERC jurisdictional gas sales for resale at negotiated rates, while Order No. 636 allowed SJG to deliver gas at delivery points on the interstate pipeline system other than its own city gate stations and release excess pipeline capacity to third parties. During 2011, off-system sales amounted to 8.0 MMdts and capacity release amounted to 63.4 MMdts.Supplies of natural gas available to SJG that are in excess of the quantity required by those customers who use gas as their sole source of fuel (firm customers) make possible the sale and transportation of gas on an interruptible basis to commercial and industrial customers whose equipment is capable of using natural gas or other fuels, such as fuel oil and propane. The term “interruptible” is used in the sense that deliveries of natural gas may be terminated by SJG at any time if this action is necessary to meet the needs of higher priority customers as described in SJG's tariffs. In 2011, usage by interruptible customers, excluding off-system customers amounted to 1.8 MMdts, approximately 1.4% of the total throughput.South Jersey Energy Solutions, LLCSJI established South Jersey Energy Solutions, LLC, (SJES) as a direct subsidiary for the purpose of serving as a holding company for all of SJI's non-utility businesses. The following businesses are wholly owned subsidiaries of SJES:15South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIMarina Energy, LLC (Marina)Marina develops and operates energy-related projects. Marina's largest operating project provides cooling, heating and emergency power to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, NJ.  Marina also owns several solar generation projects and has a 50% equity interest in LVE Energy Partners, LLC (LVE) which has entered into a contract to design, build, own and operate a district energy system and central energy center for a planned resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.Marina's other projects include a 50% equity interest in Energenic-US, LLC (Energenic).  Energenic develops, owns and operates on-site energy projects such as thermal facilities, combined heat and power facilities, landfill gas-fired electric production facilities and  solar projects.   Marina contributed approximately 24.2% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.South Jersey Resources Group, LLC (SJRG)SJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets on a wholesale basis. Customers include energy marketers, electric and gas utilities and natural gas producers. SJRG's marketing activities occur mainly in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern regions of the country.SJRG also conducts price risk management activities by entering into a variety of physical and financial transactions including forward contracts, swap agreements, option contracts and futures contracts. In 2011, SJRG transacted 323.2 Bcf of natural gas. SJRG contributed approximately 11.2% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.  South Jersey Energy Service Plus, LLC (SJESP)SJESP installs and services residential and small commercial HVAC systems, provides plumbing services, and services appliances under warranty via a subcontractor arrangement as well as on a time and materials basis. SJESP serves southern New Jersey where it is the largest local HVAC service company with nearly 50 experienced, NATE certified technicians and installers. SJESP sold the rights to renew the home appliance repair contracts to a provider of homeowner assistance services under an exclusive agreement that took effect in the third quarter of 2011. Under the terms of this agreement, SJESP received a fee for the sale of these rights. SJESP will also receive a commission on all new and renewed service contracts and be paid a fee to service those warranty contracts.  SJESP contributed approximately 2.5% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.South Jersey Energy Company (SJE)SJE provides services for the acquisition and transportation of natural gas and electricity for retail end users and markets total energy management services. As of December 31, 2011, SJE marketed natural gas and electricity to approximately 6,236 commercial and industrial customers  SJE no longer sells commodity in the residential markets.  Most customers served by SJE are located within southern New Jersey, northwestern Pennsylvania and New England. In 2011, SJE contributed approximately 2.1% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.South Jersey Exploration, LLC (SJEX)SJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.  SJEX was a wholly owned subsidiary of SJRG until November 2011, when it became a wholly owned subsidiary of SJES.  SJEX remains part of SJI's wholesale energy operations.  SJEX contributed approximately 1.1% of SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.OtherSJI Services, LLC provides services such as information technology, human resources, government relations, corporate communications, materials purchasing, fleet management and insurance to SJI and its other subsidiaries.Energy & Minerals, Inc. (EMI) principally manages liabilities associated with its discontinued operations of nonutility subsidiaries.16South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIPrimary Factors Affecting SJI's BusinessSJI's stated long-term goals are to: 1) Grow Economic Earnings per share by an average of at least 6% to 7% per year; 2) Increase the dividend on common stock by at least 6% to 7% annually; and 3) Maintain a low-to-moderate risk platform. Management established those goals in conjunction with SJI's Board of Directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence SJI's current and expected future activities.The following is a summary of the primary factors we expect to have the greatest impact on SJI's performance and ability to achieve long-term goals going forward:Business Model - In developing SJI's current business model, our focus has been on our core utility and natural extensions of that business. That focus enables us to concentrate on business activities that match our core competencies. Going forward we expect to pursue business opportunities that fit this model.Customer Growth - Southern New Jersey, our primary area of operations, has not been immune to the issues impacting the new housing market nationally. However, net customers for SJG still grew 1.0% for 2011 as we increased our focus on customer conversions.   In 2011, the 3,928 consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil represented over 65.0% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year.  In comparison, conversions over the past five years averaged 3,071 annually.  Customers in our service territory typically base their decisions to convert on comparisons of fuel costs, environmental considerations and efficiencies.  As such, SJG began a comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.Regulatory Environment - SJG is primarily regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). The BPU sets the rates that SJG charges its rate-regulated customers for services provided and establishes the terms of service under which SJG operates. We expect the BPU to continue to set rates and establish terms of service that will enable SJG to obtain a fair and reasonable return on capital invested. The BPU approved a Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) effective October 1, 2006, discussed in greater detail under Results of Operations, that protects SJG's net income from reductions in gas used by residential, commercial and small industrial customers. In addition, in March 2011, the BPU approved an extension of the Capital Investment Recovery Tracker (CIRT II) allowing SJG to accelerate $60.3 million of capital spending into 2011 and 2012.   Under CIRT II, the Company capitalizes a return on CIRT II investments until they are recovered in rate base as utility plant in service.Weather Conditions and Customer Usage Patterns - Usage patterns can be affected by a number of factors, such as wind, precipitation, temperature extremes and customer conservation. SJG's earnings are largely protected from fluctuations in temperatures by the CIP. The CIP has a stabilizing effect on utility earnings as SJG adjusts revenues when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. Our nonutility gas retail marketing business is directly affected by weather conditions, as it does not have regulatory mechanisms that address weather volatility. The impact of different weather conditions on the earnings of our nonutility businesses is dependent on a range of different factors. Consequently, weather may impact the earnings of SJI's various subsidiaries in different, or even opposite, ways. Further, the profitability of individual subsidiaries may vary from year-to-year despite experiencing substantially similar weather conditions.Changes in Natural Gas and Electricity Prices - The utility's gas costs are passed on directly to customers without any profit margin added by SJG. The price the utility charges its periodic customers is set annually, with a regulatory mechanism in place to make limited adjustments to that price during the course of a year. In the event that gas cost increases would justify customer price increases greater than those permitted under the regulatory mechanism, SJG can petition the BPU for an incremental rate increase. High prices can make it more difficult for our customers to pay their bills and may result in elevated levels of bad-debt expense. Among our nonutility activities, the one most likely to be impacted by changes in natural gas prices is our wholesale gas marketing business. Wholesale gas marketing typically benefits from volatility in gas prices during different points in time. The actual price of the commodity does not typically have an impact on the performance of this business line.  Our ability to add and retain customers at our retail gas marketing business is affected by the relationship between the price that the utility charges customers for gas and the cost of gas available in the market at specific points in time.  However, retail gas marketing accounts for a very small portion of SJI's overall activities. 17South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIEnergy Project Development - Marina Energy, LLC, SJI's energy project development business, focuses on designing, building, owning and/or operating energy production facilities on, or adjacent to, customer sites. That business is currently involved with several projects that are either operating, or are under development. Based upon our experience to date, market issues that impact the reliability and price of electricity supplied by utilities, and discussions that we are having regarding additional projects, we expect to continue to expand this business. However, the price of natural gas, as well as the availability of various tax incentives and rebates, has a direct effect on the economics of these projects.  Further, our largest project opportunities to date have been and are expected to continue to be in the casino gaming industry.  Consequently, the economic condition of that industry is important to the near term prospects for obtaining additional projects. Changes in Interest Rates - SJI has operated in a relatively low interest rate environment over the past several years. Rising interest rates would raise the expense associated with existing variable-rate debt and all issuances of new debt. We have sought to mitigate the impact of a potential rising rate environment by directly issuing fixed-rate debt, or by entering into derivative transactions to hedge against rising interest rates.Labor and Benefit Costs - Labor and benefit costs have a significant impact on SJI's profitability. Benefit costs, especially those related to pension and health care, have risen in recent years. We sought to manage these costs by revising health care plans offered to existing employees, capping postretirement health care benefits, and changing health care and pension packages offered to new hires. We expect savings from these changes to gradually increase as new hires replace retiring employees. In an effort to accelerate the realization of those benefits, we offered a voluntary separation program at the beginning of 2010 to our unionized employees. Our workforce totaled approximately 675 employees at the end of 2011, of which approximately 330 of that total are unionized.Balance Sheet Strength - Our goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet with an average annual equity-to-capitalization ratio of 50%. Our equity-to-capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt, was 45.5% and 44.8% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively. A strong balance sheet permits us to maintain the financial flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities and to address volatile economic and commodity markets while maintaining a low-to-moderate risk platform.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS - As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Five types of transactions presented in our consolidated financial statements require a significant amount of judgment and estimation. These relate to regulatory accounting, derivatives, environmental remediation costs, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and revenue recognition.Regulatory Accounting - SJI's largest subsidiary, SJG, maintains its accounts according to the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the BPU. As a result of the ratemaking process, SJG is required to follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 980 - “Regulated Operations.”  SJG is required under Topic 980 to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. SJG is required under its Basic Gas Supply Service clause (BGSS) to forecast its natural gas costs and customer consumption in setting its rates. Subject to BPU approval, SJG is able to recover or return the difference between gas cost recoveries and the actual costs of gas through a BGSS charge to customers. SJG records any under/over recoveries as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflects them in the BGSS charge to customers in subsequent years. SJG also enters into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases. The offset to the resulting derivative assets or liabilities is also recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets.  See additional detailed discussions on Rates and Regulatory Actions in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Derivatives - SJI recognizes assets or liabilities for contracts that qualify as derivatives that are entered into by its subsidiaries when contracts are executed. We record contracts at their fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815 - “Derivatives and Hedging.”  We record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of tax, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and recognize such changes in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings in the current period. Currently we do not designate energy-related derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Certain derivatives that result in the physical delivery of the commodity may meet the criteria to be accounted for as normal purchases and normal sales if so designated, in which case the contract is not marked-to-market, but rather is accounted for when the commodity is delivered. Due to the application of regulatory accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), derivatives related to SJG's gas purchases that are marked-to-market are recorded through the BGSS.  SJG occasionally enters into financial derivatives to hedge against forward price risk. These derivatives are recorded at fair value with an offset to regulatory assets and liabilities through SJG's BGSS, subject to BPU approval (See Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). 18South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIWe adjust the fair value of the contracts each reporting period for changes in the market.  As discussed in Notes 16 and 17 of the consolidated financial statements, energy-related derivative instruments are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted market sources in active markets and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC Topic 820 - “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” Certain non-exchange-based contracts are valued using indicative non-binding price quotations available through brokers or from over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that management believes provide the most liquid market.  Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations with at least one additional source to ensure the prices are observable market information, which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. Derivative instruments that are used to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable-rate, long-term debt are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment, as a result, these instruments are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs.  In instances where observable data is unavailable, management considers the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability.  This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration.  Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the model inputs generally are not observable. Counterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI, are incorporated and considered in the valuation of all derivative instruments as appropriate. The effect of counterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI on the derivative valuations is not significant.Environmental Remediation Costs -We estimate a range of future costs based on projected investigation and work plans using existing technologies. In preparing consolidated financial statements, SJI records liabilities for future costs using the lower end of the range of future costs because a single reliable estimation point is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty involved in the nature of projected remediation efforts and the long period over which remediation efforts will continue. We update estimates each year to take into account past efforts, changes in work plans, remediation technologies, government regulations and site specific requirements (See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs - The costs of providing pension and other postretirement employee benefits are impacted by actual plan experience as well as assumptions of future experience. Employee demographics, plan contributions, investment performance, and assumptions concerning mortality, return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trends all have a significant impact on determining our projected benefit obligations. We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them accordingly. These adjustments could result in significant changes to the net periodic benefit costs of providing such benefits and the related liabilities recognized by SJI.     Pension contributions in both 2009 and 2010, coupled with improvements in equity markets during 2009, reduced the cost of providing such benefits in 2010, despite a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets.Continued improvements in the equity markets through 2010 allowed the cost of the employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans to decrease even further, partially offset by the negative effect of decreasing discount rates in 2011. SJI experienced increases in its officer pension plan, which was also impacted by the lower discount rate.  As the officer pension plan contains no assets, it was not afforded the benefit of improvements in the equity markets.  Additional information regarding investment returns and assumptions can be found in Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Note 12 to the financial statements.  The combination of slowing equity markets and lower discount rates in 2011, which are used in determining plan costs in 2012, are expected to increase the cost of providing such plans in 2012.  However, SJI has taken measures to manage this increase by making a $25.0 million pension plan contribution in January 2012.  As such, the resulting financial impact on the company is not expected to be significant. Revenue Recognition - Gas and electricity revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered to customers. SJG, SJRG and SJE bill customers monthly. A majority of SJG and SJE customers have their meters read on a cycle basis throughout the month. For SJG and SJE retail customers that are not billed at the end of each month, we record an estimate to recognize unbilled revenues for gas/electricity delivered from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the month. SJG's and SJE's unbilled revenue for natural gas is estimated each month based on monthly deliveries into the system; unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results; customer-specific use factors, when available; actual temperatures during the period; and applicable customer rates. SJE's unbilled revenue for retail electricity is based on customer-specific use factors and applicable customer rates. We bill SJG customers at rates approved by the BPU. SJE and SJRG customers are billed at rates negotiated between the parties.19South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIWe recognize revenues related to SJESP's appliance service contracts seasonally over the full term of the contract. Revenues related to services provided on a time and materials basis are recognized on a monthly basis as the services are provided.Marina recognizes revenue on a monthly basis as services are provided and for on-site energy production that is delivered to its customers.The BPU allows SJG to recover gas costs in rates through the BGSS price structure. SJG defers over/under recoveries of gas costs and includes them in subsequent adjustments to the BGSS rate. These adjustments result in over/under recoveries of gas costs being included in rates during future periods. As a result of these deferrals, utility revenue recognition does not directly translate to profitability. While SJG realizes profits on gas sales during the month of providing the utility service, significant shifts in revenue recognition may result from the various recovery clauses approved by the BPU. This revenue recognition process does not shift earnings between periods, as these clauses only provide for cost recovery on a dollar-for-dollar basis (See Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).In January 2010, the BPU approved an extension of the CIP through 2013.  The CIP may be extended for a one year period in the absence of a Board order taking any affirmative action to the contrary. Each CIP year begins October 1 and ends September 30 of the subsequent year.  On a monthly basis during the CIP year, SJG records adjustments to earnings based on weather and customer usage factors, as incurred.  Subsequent to each year, SJG makes filings with the BPU to review and approve amounts recorded under the CIP.  BPU approved cash inflows or outflows generally will not begin until the next CIP year and have no impact on earnings at that time.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - See detailed discussions concerning New Accounting Pronouncements and their impact on SJI in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.RATES AND REGULATION - As a public utility, SJG is subject to regulation by the BPU. Additionally, the Natural Gas Policy Act, which was enacted in November 1978, contains provisions for Federal regulation of certain aspects of SJG's business. SJG is affected by Federal regulation with respect to transportation and pricing policies applicable to pipeline capacity from Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporation (SJG's major supplier), Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation and Dominion Transmission, Inc., since such services are provided under rates and terms established under the jurisdiction of the FERC. SJG's retail sales are made under rate schedules within a tariff filed with and subject to the jurisdiction of the BPU. These rate schedules provide primarily for either block rates or demand/commodity rate structures. SJG's primary rate mechanisms include base rates, the Basic Gas Supply Service Clause, Capital Investment Recovery Tracker, Energy Efficiency Tracker and the Conservation Incentive Program.Effective September 17, 2010, the BPU granted SJG a base rate increase of $42.1 million, which was predicated, in part, upon a 8.21% rate of return on rate base that included a 10.3% return on common equity.  The $42.1 million includes $16.6 million of revenue previously recovered through the CIP and $6.8 million of revenues previously recovered through the CIRT, resulting in incremental revenue of $18.7 million.  SJG was permitted to recover regulatory assets contained in its petition and is allowed to defer certain federally mandated pipeline integrity management program costs for recovery in its next base rate case.  In addition, annual depreciation expense will be reduced by $1.2 million as a result of the amortization of excess cost of removal recoveries.  The BPU also authorized a Phase II of the rate proceeding to address the recovery of investment in CIRT not rolled into rate base in this case.In April 2009, the BPU approved the Capital Investment Recovery Tracker (CIRT) an accelerated infrastructure investment program and an associated rate tracker, which allowed SJG to accelerate $103.0 million of capital spending into 2009 and 2010.  The BPU authorized Phase II of its rate case proceeding to address the recovery of investments in CIRT not rolled into rate base in its September 2010 rate case settlement. The CIRT allows SJG to earn a return of, and return on, investment as the capital is spent.  In March 2011, the BPU approved an extension of the Capital Investment Recovery Tracker (CIRT II) allowing SJG to accelerate $60.3 million of capital spending into 2011 and 2012.  Under CIRT II, the Company capitalizes a return on CIRT II investments until they are recovered in rate base as utility plant in service.The Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) is a BPU approved pilot program that is designed to eliminate the link between SJG profits and the quantity of natural gas SJG sells, and to foster conservation efforts. With the CIP, SJG's profits are tied to the number of customers served and how efficiently SJG serves them, thus allowing SJG to focus on encouraging conservation and energy efficiency among its customers without negatively impacting net income.  The CIP tracking mechanism adjusts earnings based on weather, and also adjusts SJG's earnings when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer.  In January 2010, the BPU approved an extension of the CIP through September 2013.  The CIP may be extended for a one year period in the absence of a Board order taking any affirmative action to the contrary with regard to the pilot program.20South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIUtility earnings are recognized during current periods based upon the application of the CIP. The cash impact of variations in customer usage will result in cash being collected from, or returned to, customers during the subsequent CIP year, which runs from October 1 to September 30.The effects of the CIP on SJG's net income for the last three years and the associated weather comparisons were as follows ($'s in millions): 201120102009Net Income Benefit:   CIP - Weather Related$5.6$1.1$0.8CIP - Usage Related2.25.58.5Total Net Income Benefit$7.8$6.6$9.3 Weather Compared to 20-Year Average10.0% warmer2.2% warmer1.1% warmerWeather Compared to Prior Year7.8% warmer0.1% warmer3.9% colderAs part of the CIP, SJG is required to implement additional conservation programs including customized customer communication and outreach efforts, targeted upgrade furnace efficiency packages, financing offers, and an outreach program to speak to local and state institutional constituents. SJG is also required to reduce gas supply and storage assets and their associated fees. Note that changes in fees associated with supply and storage assets have no effect on SJG's net income as these costs are passed through directly to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis.Earnings accrued and payments received under the CIP are limited to a level that will not cause SJG's return on equity to exceed 10.3% (excluding earnings from off-system gas sales and certain other tariff clauses) and the annualized savings attained from reducing gas supply and storage assets.See additional detailed discussions on Rates and Regulatory Actions in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - See detailed discussion concerning Environmental Remediation in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.COMPETITION - SJG's franchises are non-exclusive. Currently, no other utility provides retail gas distribution services within SJG's territory. SJG does not expect any other utilities to do so in the foreseeable future because of the extensive investment required for utility plant and related costs. SJG competes with oil, propane and electricity suppliers for residential, commercial and industrial users, with alternative fuel source providers (wind, solar and fuel cells) based upon price, convenience and environmental factors, and with other marketers/brokers in the selling of wholesale natural gas services. The market for natural gas commodity sales is subject to competition due to deregulation. SJG's competitive position against alternate fuels was enhanced while maintaining margins by using an unbundled tariff. This tariff allows full cost-of-service recovery when transporting gas for our customers. Under this tariff, SJG profits from transporting, rather than selling, the commodity. SJG's residential, commercial and industrial customers can choose their supplier while SJG recovers the cost of service through transportation service (See Customer Choice Legislation below).SJRG competes in the wholesale natural gas market against a wide array of competitors on a cost competitive, term of service, and reliability basis. SJRG has been a reliable energy provider in this arena for 16 years. There has been significant consolidation of energy wholesale operations and large financial institutions have also entered the marketplace. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, which could result in downward pressure on the margins available.Marina competes with other companies that develop and operate on-site energy production. Marina also faces competition from customers' preferences for alternative technologies for energy production, as well as those customers that address their energy needs internally.21South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJE competes with utilities and other third-party marketers to sell the unregulated natural gas and electricity commodity to customers. Marketers compete largely on price, which is driven by the commodity market. While the utilities are typically indifferent as to where customers get their gas or electricity, the price they set for the commodity they sell creates competition for SJE. Based on its market share, SJE is one of the largest marketers of natural gas in southern New Jersey as of December 31, 2011. In addition, similar to SJG, SJE faces competition from other energy products. SJESP competes primarily with smaller, local contractors in southern New Jersey that install residential and commercial HVAC systems and provide major appliance repair and plumbing services. These contractors typically only serve their local communities and do not serve the entire southern part of New Jersey. CUSTOMER CHOICE LEGISLATION - All residential natural gas customers in New Jersey can choose their natural gas commodity supplier under the terms of the “Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of 1999." This bill created the framework and necessary time schedules for the restructuring of the state's electric and natural gas utilities. The Act established unbundling, where redesigned utility rate structures allow natural gas and electric consumers to choose their energy supplier. It also established time frames for instituting competitive services for customer account functions and for determining whether basic gas supply services should become competitive. Customers purchasing natural gas from a provider other than the local utility (the “marketer”) are charged for the gas costs by the marketer and charged for the transportation costs by the utility. The total number of customers in SJG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 37,829, 30,152 and 28,379 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:SJI operates in several different reportable operating segments. Gas Utility Operations (SJG) consists primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Wholesale Energy Operations include SJRG's activities. SJE is involved in both retail gas and retail electric activities. Retail Gas and Other Operations include natural gas acquisition and transportation service business lines. Retail Electric Operations consist of electricity acquisition and transportation to commercial and industrial customers. On-Site Energy Production consists of Marina's thermal energy facility and other energy-related projects. Appliance Service Operations includes SJESP's servicing of appliances under warranty via a subcontractor arrangement as well as on a time and materials basis, and the installation of residential and small commercial HVAC systems.  The Retail Energy Operations caption includes Retail Gas and Other, Retail Electric, On-Site Energy Production and Appliance Service Operations. Net Income attributable to SJI for 2011 increased $22.6 million, or 34.0%, to $89.3 million compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the following:•The income contribution from Marina increased $12.2 million to $21.6 million due primarily to the impact of the investment tax credit available on renewable energy facilities.•The income contribution from SJG increased $9.0 million to $52.9 million due primarily to the settlement of the base rate case in September 2010.•The income contribution from SJRG increased $6.5 million to $10.0 million due primarily to the change in unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used by SJRG to mitigate natural gas commodity price risk, as discussed below.•The income contribution from SJESP increased $1.9 million to $2.2 million due primarily to proceeds received from a provider of homeowner assistance services, in accordance with an agreement with the Company that gives them the exclusive right to renew the home appliance repair contracts at SJESP.•The income contribution from SJE decreased $7.0 million to $1.8 million due primarily to the change in unrealized gains and losses on forward financial contracts used to mitigate price risk on electricity as discussed under Operating Revenues – Nonutility below.Net Income attributable to SJI for 2010 increased $8.5 million, or 14.7%, to $66.7 million compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the following:•The income contribution from SJE for 2010 increased $13.2 million to $8.8 million due primarily to the change in unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used to mitigate price risk on electric as discussed below.•The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the impact of the investment tax credit available on renewable energy facilities at Marina, which resulted in a $6.4 million decrease in income taxes.22South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II•The income contribution from SJG for 2010 increased $4.7 million, or 12.0%, to $43.9 million due primarily to the settlement of the base rate case in September 2010.•The income contribution from SJRG for 2010 decreased $13.4 million, or 75.1%, to $4.4 million due primarily to the change in unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used by SJRG to mitigate natural gas commodity price risk, as discussed below.A significant portion of the volatility in operating results is due to the impact of the accounting methods associated with SJI's derivative activities. The Company uses derivatives to limit its exposure to market risk on transactions to buy, sell, transport and store natural gas and to buy and sell retail electricity. The Company also uses derivatives to limit its exposure to increasing interest rates on variable-rate debt.The types of transactions that cause the most significant volatility in operating results are as follows:•SJRG purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale in the future. SJRG uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock-in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. However, gas stored in inventory is accounted for at the lower of average cost or market; the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of derivatives change, even when the underlying hedged value of the inventory is unchanged. Additional volatility in earnings is created when realized gains and losses on derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk on expected future purchases of gas in storage are recognized in earnings when the derivative settles but the cost of the related gas in storage is not recognized in earnings until the period of withdrawal. This volatility can be significant from period to period. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of gas in storage will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.•SJE uses forward contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts with customers. In accordance with GAAP, the forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. Several related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and therefore are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.   As a result, management also uses the non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) financial measures of Economic Earnings, Economic Earnings per share, Non-Utility Economic Earnings, Wholesale Energy Economic Earnings and Retail Energy Economic Earnings when evaluating the results of operations for its nonutility operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, earnings per share from continuing operations or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. We define Economic Earnings as: Income from continuing operations, (1) less the change in unrealized gains and plus the change in unrealized losses, as applicable and in each case after tax, on all commodity derivative transactions and the ineffective portion of interest rate derivative transactions that we are marking to market, and (2) less realized gains and plus realized losses, as applicable and in each case after tax, on all commodity derivative transactions attributed to expected purchases of gas in storage to match the recognition of these gains and losses with the recognition of the related cost of gas in storage in the period of withdrawal.Economic Earnings is a significant performance metric used by our management to indicate the amount and timing of income from continuing operations that we expect to earn after taking into account the impact of derivative instruments on the related transactions. Specifically, we believe that this financial measure indicates to investors the profitability of the entire derivative related transaction and not just the portion that is subject to mark-to-market valuation under GAAP. Considering only the change in market value on the derivative side of the transaction can produce a false sense as to the ultimate profitability of the total transaction as no change in value is reflected for the non-derivative portion of the transaction.Economic Earnings for 2011 increased $6.0 million, or 7.4%, to $87.0 million compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the following:23South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II•The income contribution from Marina increased $10.9 million to $22.0 million due primarily to the impact of the investment tax credit available on renewable energy facilities.•The income contribution from SJG increased $9.0 million to $52.9 million due primarily to the settlement of the base rate case in September 2010.•The income contribution from SJESP increased $1.9 million to $2.2 million due primarily to proceeds received from a provider of homeowner assistance services, in accordance with an agreement with the Company that gives them the exclusive right to renew the home appliance repair contracts at SJESP.•The income contribution from SJRG decreased $15.4 million to $4.9 million due primarily to tighter spreads attained on our storage and transportation assets.Economic Earnings for 2010 increased $9.7 million, or 13.7%, to $81.0 million compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the following:•The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the impact of the investment tax credit available on renewable energy facilities at Marina, which resulted in a $6.4 million decrease in income taxes.•The income contribution from SJG for 2010 increased $4.7 million, or 12.0%, to $43.9 million due primarily to the settlement of the base rate case in September 2010. 24South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThe following table presents a reconciliation of our income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations to Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings per share (in thousands except per share data): 201120102009    Income from Continuing Operations$89,859$67,285$58,532Minus/Plus:   Unrealized Mark-to-Market Losses/(Gains) on Derivatives(2,815)15,0688,322Realized (Gains)/Losses on Inventory Injection Hedges(61)(1,370)4,401    Economic Earnings$86,983$80,983$71,255    Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations$2.99$2.25$1.96Minus/Plus:   Unrealized Mark-to-Market Losses/(Gains) on Derivatives(0.10)0.500.27Realized (Gains)/Losses on Inventory Injection Hedges—(0.05)0.15    Economic Earnings per Share$2.89$2.70$2.38        Non-Utility Income from Continuing Operations$36,970$23,361$19,440Minus/Plus:   Unrealized Mark-to-Market Losses/(Gains) on Derivatives(2,815)15,0688,322Realized (Gains)/Losses on Inventory Injection Hedges(61)(1,370)4,401    Non-Utility Economic Earnings$34,094$37,059$32,163        Wholesale Energy Income from Continuing Operations$10,960$4,447$17,859Minus/Plus:   Unrealized Mark-to-Market Losses/(Gains) on Derivatives(5,078)18,1412,416Realized (Gains)/Losses on Inventory Injection Hedges(61)(1,370)4,401    Wholesale Energy Economic Earnings$5,821$21,218$24,676        Retail Energy Income from Continuing Operations$26,010$18,914$1,581Minus/Plus:   Unrealized Mark-to-Market Losses/(Gains) on Derivatives2,263(3,073)5,906    Retail Energy Economic Earnings$28,273$15,841$7,48725South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) is as follows (gains (losses) in thousands): 2011 2010 2009                Gains (losses) on energy related commodity contracts5,377 (22,624) (14,815)                Gains (losses) on interest rate contracts(149) (641) 1,210                         Total before income taxes5,228 (23,265) (13,605)                         Income taxes (A)(2,143) 9,539 5,578                     Total after income taxes3,085 (13,726) (8,027)   Unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivatives    held by affiliated companies, net of tax (A)         (270) (1,342) (295)   Total unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivatives2,815 (15,068) (8,322)   Realized gains (losses) on inventory injection hedges, net of tax (A)61 1,370 (4,401)   Total reconciling items between income from continuing    operations and economic earnings2,876 (13,698) (12,723)(A)  Determined using a combined statutory tax rate of 41%26South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThroughput-Utility -

Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on our financial results.Throughput -  Utility - Total gas throughput increased 17.3 MMdts, or 15.6%, from 2010 to 2011.  This increase was realized primarily in the Capacity Release markets.  Capacity Release increased 17.1 MMdts during 2011, as compared with 2010, as a result of increased opportunity for such sales.  Additional capacity became available during the latter part of 2010 as capacity previously transferred out of SJG under the provisions of the Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) was returned to the utility.  Firm throughput decreased 1.7 MMdts, or 3.0%, during 2011, compared with 2010, as a result of 7.8% warmer weather, partially offset by customer growth.  The Company added 3,579 customers over the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011, which represents a growth rate of 1.0%.Total gas throughput increased 12.1 MMdts, or 12.3%, from 2009 to 2010.  The majority of the increase is attributable to higher capacity release, which increased by 7.9 MMdts over 2009, as reflected in the table above.  More capacity became available during 2010 as capacity previously transferred out of SJG under the provisions of the CIP were returned to the utility.  See additional discussion of the CIP under “Rates and Regulation.”  In addition, cogeneration and electric generation sales and transportation throughput increased in 2010.  As the summer of 2010 was one of the hottest on record, higher electric consumption for air conditioning drove the demand for greater natural gas consumption by the region's electric utility.  In the cogeneration market, a significant increase in transportation throughput was realized as a single customer increased its contract significantly to shift supply from its alternative pipeline supplier to SJG.  Firm throughput also increased moderately due to the addition of 3,956 residential customers in 2010.28South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIOperating Revenues - Utility - Revenues decreased $63.7 million, or 13.6%, during 2011 compared with 2010 after eliminating intercompany transactions.  Firm sales revenue decreased $73.0 million, or 16.7%, during 2011 versus 2010, as the result of lower natural gas costs, which precipitated two customer refunds in 2011 totaling $39.8 million, exclusive of sales tax which does not impact utility revenues.  The average cost of natural gas purchased during 2011 was $5.94 per dt, representing an 11.3% decrease relative to the average cost of $6.70 per dt during 2010. While changes in gas costs and BGSS recoveries may fluctuate from period to period, SJG does not profit from the sale of the commodity.  Therefore, corresponding fluctuation in Operating Revenue-Utility or Cost of Sales-Utility have no impact on Company profitability, as further discussed under "Margin-Utility."Warmer weather during the year, primarily during the fourth quarter of 2011, also contributed to lower revenue.  Weather was 7.8% warmer than last year and 10.0% warmer than normal.Partially offsetting the negative impact of lower natural gas costs and warm weather on firm sales revenues was the impact of adding approximately 3,600 customers over the last twelve months, representing 1% growth.  Off-system sales (OSS) revenue and capacity release revenue increased $6.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, during 2011 versus 2010, as both sales and capacity release volumetric throughput increased.  As previously stated under "Throughput-Utility," this was made possible when additional capacity became available during the latter part of 2010, as capacity previously transferred out of SJG under the CIP was returned to SJG.  As reflected in the Margin table above, the impact of the higher OSS and capacity release activity during 2011 did not have a material impact on the earnings of the Company, as SJG is required to share 85% of the profits of such activity with the ratepayers.Revenues decreased $10.9 million, or 2.3%, during 2010 compared with 2009 after eliminating intercompany transactions.  Firm revenues decreased $6.3 million, or 1.4%, primarily as a result of a lower BGSS rate in effect during 2010.  While changes in gas costs and BGSS recoveries may fluctuate from period to period, SJG does not profit from the sale of the commodity.  Therefore, corresponding fluctuations in Operating Revenue or Cost of Sales have no impact on Company profitability, as further discussed under “Margin.”  There was also a $2.2 million decrease in OSS during 2010 versus 2009.  This decrease was primarily related to more volume being marketed as capacity release compared with 2009.  As reflected in the Margin table above, the impact of lower OSS did not have a material impact on the earnings of the Company, as SJG is required to share 85% of the profits of such activity with the ratepayers.Operating Revenues - Nonutility 2011 vs. 2010 - Combined revenues for SJI's nonutility businesses, net of intercompany transactions, decreased by $32.8 million, or 7.2%, in 2011, compared with 2010.SJE's revenues from retail gas operations, net of intercompany transactions, decreased by $12.2 million, or 10.9%, in 2011, compared with 2010.  Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts of $0.2 million due to price volatility, revenues decreased $12.0 million.  This decrease was due mainly to  an 8.0% decrease in the average monthly NYMEX settle price and the impact of SJE exiting the residential market in October of 2011.  SJE's residential contracts were at higher fixed prices reflective of market conditions from two years ago when the recently expired program was established. The majority of SJE's other natural gas customer contracts are market-priced.  As of December 31, SJE was serving the following number of retail gas customers:  2011 2010Residential — 7,177Commercial & Large Volume 1,662 1,533Sales volumes for the comparative period were as follows (in dekatherms):  2011 2010Residential 407,808 686,689Commercial & Large Volume 18,252,903 17,633,24329South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIMarket conditions continue to make it difficult to be competitive in the residential and small commercial markets. We continue to focus our marketing efforts on the pursuit of non-heat-sensitive commercial customers in an effort to mitigate price volatility and weather risk. SJE's revenues from retail electric operations, net of intercompany transactions, increased $2.9 million, or 1.5%, in 2011, compared with 2010. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility of $11.1 million, revenues increased $14.0 million or 7.4%.  A summary of SJE's retail electric revenue is as follows (in millions): 20112010Change    SJE Retail Electric Revenue$199.4$196.5$2.9    Add: Unrealized Losses (Subtract: Unrealized Gains)3.1(8.0)11.1    SJE Retail Electric Revenue, Excluding Unrealized Losses (Gains)$202.5$188.5$14.0This increase was mainly due to a 11.4% increase in volumes which was partially offset by a 2.5% decrease in the average monthly Locational Marginal Price (LMP) per megawatt hour in 2011 compared with 2010.  SJE uses forward financial contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the forward financial contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. Some of  the related customer  contracts are not considered derivatives and therefore are not recorded in earnings until electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price for the forward financial contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electricity under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward financial contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated. SJE serves both fixed and market-priced customers.SJRG's revenues from wholesale energy operations, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $20.4 million, or 23.0%, in 2011, compared with 2010. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts of $(39.3) million due to price volatility and adjusting for the net change in realized gains and losses on all hedges attributed to inventory transactions of $2.2 million to align them with the related cost of inventory in the period of withdrawal, SJRG's revenues decreased $57.5 million. A summary of SJRG's revenue is as follows (in millions): 20112010Change    SJRG Revenue$68.0$88.4$(20.4)    Add: Unrealized Losses (Subtract: Unrealized Gains)(8.6)30.7(39.3)Add:  Realized Losses (Subtract: Realized Gains) on Inventory Injection Hedges(0.1)(2.3)2.2    SJRG Revenue, Excluding Unrealized Losses (Gains) and Realized Losses (Gains) on Inventory Injection Hedges$59.3$116.8$(57.5)This decrease in revenues is mainly attributable to a 61.6% decrease in sales of storage volumes, which are shown gross in the statement of operations, along with an 8% decrease in the average monthly NYMEX settle price, partially offset by a 31.4% increase in total sales volumes. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility.Revenues from on-site energy production at Marina, net of intercompany transactions,  decreased $0.2 million, or 0.4%, in 2011 compared with 2010, due mainly to an asset sale in 2011 that resulted in the termination of a large customer contract, which was partially offset by several new solar projects that came on line in 2011. Thermal plant hot and chilled water revenues were relatively unchanged for the comparative period.30South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIRevenues from appliance service operations at SJESP decreased $2.7 million, or 13.6%, in 2011, compared with 2010, due mainly to  a decrease in customer warranty contract sales. SJESP sold the rights to renew the home appliance repair contracts to a provider of homeowner assistance services under an exclusive agreement that took effect in the third quarter of 2011. Under the terms of this agreement, SJESP received a fee for the sale of these rights (See Other Income and Expense). SJESP will also receive a commission for all new and renewed service contracts and be paid a fee to service those warranty contracts.Operating Revenues - Nonutility 2010 vs. 2009 - Combined revenues for SJI's nonutility businesses, net of intercompany transactions, increased by $90.5 million in 2010, compared with 2009.SJE's revenues from retail gas operations, net of intercompany transactions, increased by $4.4 million, or 4.1%, in 2010, compared with 2009 due mainly to volumetric growth of 13.1% and a 10.8% increase in the average monthly NYMEX settle price.  The majority of SJE's natural gas customer contracts are market-priced.  As of December 31, SJE was serving the following number of retail gas customers:  2010 2009Residential 7,177 8,772Commercial & Large Volume 1,533 1,415Sales volumes for the comparative period were as follows (in dekatherms):  2010 2009Residential 686,689 826,234Commercial & Large Volume 17,633,243 15,365,834Market conditions continue to make it difficult to be competitive in the residential and small commercial markets. We continue to focus our marketing efforts on the pursuit of non-heat-sensitive commercial customers in an effort to mitigate price volatility and weather risk. SJE's revenues from retail electric operations, net of intercompany transactions, increased $92.1 million, or 88.2%, in 2010, compared with 2009. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility of $18.5 million, revenues increased $73.6 million or 64.0%.  A summary of SJE's retail electric revenue is as follows (in millions): 20102009Change    SJE Retail Electric Revenue$196.5$104.4$92.1    Add: Unrealized Losses (Subtract: Unrealized Gains)(8.0)10.5(18.5)    SJE Retail Electric Revenue, Excluding Unrealized Losses (Gains)$188.5$114.9$73.6This increase was mainly due to the impact of SJE being the successful bidder on a contract to supply retail electricity to over 400 school districts located throughout the state of New Jersey beginning in April 2009 through April 2012 and a 27.8% increase in the average monthly Locational Marginal Price (LMP) per megawatt hour in 2010 compared with 2009. The contract with the school districts is expected to be rebid in 2012.  Excluding the school district contract, most of SJE's retail electric customer contracts are market-priced.SJRG's revenues from wholesale energy operations, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $8.7 million in 2010, compared with 2009. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts of $26.6 million due to price volatility and adjusting for the change in realized gains and losses on all hedges attributed to inventory transactions of $(9.8) million to align them with the related cost of inventory in the period of withdrawal, SJRG's revenues increased $8.1 million. A summary of SJRG's revenue is as follows (in millions):31South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II 20102009Change    SJRG Revenue$88.4$97.1$(8.7)    Add: Unrealized Losses (Subtract: Unrealized Gains)30.74.126.6Add:  Realized Losses (Subtract: Realized Gains) on Inventory Injection Hedges(2.3)7.5(9.8)    SJRG Revenue, Excluding Unrealized Losses (Gains) and Realized Losses (Gains) on Inventory Injection Hedges$116.8$108.7$8.1This increase in revenues is mainly attributable to increased marketing of Marcellus area production gas and a 43.1% increase in sales of storage volumes. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility.Revenues from on-site energy production at Marina increased $1.1 million, or 3.0%, in 2010 compared with 2009, due mainly to  higher chilled  (23.8%) and hot (34.6%) water volumetric production. Volumetric increases were driven by the impact of improving economic conditions on resort occupancy and the significance of temperature extremes experienced in the summer and winter of 2010 compared with 2009. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of AC Landfill Energy, LLC (ACLE) and WC Landfill Energy, LLC (WCLE) as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenues from the appliance service operations at SJESP increased $0.8 million, or 4.4%, in 2010, compared with 2009, due mainly to additional installation jobs fueled by the availability of state stimulus incentives which was partially offset by revenues from a large commercial installation job recorded in 2009.Margin - Utility - SJG's margin is defined as natural gas revenues less natural gas costs; volumetric and revenue based energy taxes; and regulatory rider expenses. We believe that margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than revenues since natural gas costs, energy taxes and regulatory rider expenses are passed through to customers, and therefore, have no effect on margin. Natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities through the BGSS tariff.Total margin in 2011 increased $14.5 million, or 7.8%, from 2010 primarily due to a full year of the rate case settlement and approval of CIRT II, both discussed above under “Rates and Regulation,” customer additions and increased firm industrial customer usage.  The CIRT programs allow SJG to earn a return on approved infrastructure investments made under these programs.Approximately $6.8 million of revenues previously recovered through the CIRT were moved into base rates beginning in September 2010, see additional discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.The CIP protected $13.3 million of pre-tax margin in 2011 that would have been lost due to lower customer usage, compared to $11.1 million in 2010.  Of these amounts, $9.6 million and $1.9 million were related to weather variations and $3.7 million and $9.2 million were related to other customer usage variations in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Total margin in 2010 increased $17.2 million, or 10.2%, from 2009 primarily due to the rate case settlement discussed above under “Rates and Regulation”, a full year of the CIRT and customer additions.  The CIRT allows SJG to earn a return on approved infrastructure investments made under this program.The CIP protected $11.1 million of pre-tax margin in 2010 that would have been lost due to lower customer usage, compared to $15.8 million in 2009.  Of these amounts, $1.9 million and $1.4 million were related to weather variations and $9.2 million and $14.4 million were related to other customer usage variations in 2010 and 2009, respectively.Gross Margin - Nonutility - Gross margin for the nonutility businesses is defined as revenue less all costs that are directly related to the production, selling and delivery of the company's products and services. These costs primarily include natural gas and electric commodity costs as well as certain payroll and related benefits. On the statements of consolidated income, revenue is reflected in Operating Revenues - Nonutility and the costs are reflected in Cost of Sales - Nonutility. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility.32South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIFor 2011, combined gross margins for the nonutility businesses, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $1.7 million to $59.0 million compared with 2010. This decrease is primarily due to the following: •Gross margin from the wholesale energy operations of SJRG increased $11.2 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts of $(39.3) million and the net change in realized gains and losses on all hedges attributed to inventory transactions of $2.2 million as discussed above, gross margin for SJRG decreased $25.9 million due mainly to tighter spreads attained on our storage and transportation assets.   Storage assets allow SJRG to lock in the differential between purchasing natural gas at low current prices and selling equivalent quantities at higher future prices. Gross margin is generated via seasonal pricing differentials. While this margin will be attained over the transaction cycle, the timing of physical injections and withdrawals and related hedge settlements can cause earnings fluctuations for accounting purposes due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. Margins were also negatively impacted by increased production of natural gas in the Marcellus region where SJRG has committed to purchase minimum volumes at index-based prices. This increased production, coupled with pipeline disruptions and expansion delays, caused temporary take-away constraints throughout the region which caused a decrease in market prices. Market prices have improved as additional capacity was brought on line beginning in November of 2011. Overall, SJRG's contribution to margin from storage and transportation assets has decreased due to market conditions and, as a result, SJRG has shed some of these assets.  However, SJRG expects to continue to add incremental margin from marketing and related opportunities in the Marcellus region, capitalizing on its established presence in the area.  Future margins could fluctuate significantly due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. As of December 31, 2011, SJRG had 8.6 Bcf of storage and 194,282 dts/day of transportation under contract.  • Gross Margin from on-site energy production at Marina decreased $0.5 million in 2011 compared with 2010. This decrease was mainly due to higher electricity costs at the thermal plant and the loss of one customer (See Operating Revenues - Nonutility) that were partially offset by margins from new solar projects that came on line in 2011. Gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly in 2011 compared with 2010. • Gross margin from SJE's retail gas and other operations decreased $0.5 million in 2011, compared with 2010. Excluding the impact of a $0.2 million change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts as discussed above, gross margin decreased $0.3 million in 2011, compared with 2010, due mainly to the impact of SJE exiting the residential market (See Operating Revenues - Nonutility). Gross margins as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly in 2011, compared with 2010. • Gross margin from SJE's retail electric operations decreased $9.8 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Excluding the impact of a $11.1million change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts as discussed above, gross margin increased $1.3 million in 2011 compared with 2010. This increase was mainly due to volumetric growth(See Operating Revenues - Nonutility).  Excluding the impact of the change in unrealized gains/losses, gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly in 2011 compared with 2010.  • Gross margin from the appliance service operations at SJESP decreased $1.9 million in 2011 compared with 2010 due mainly to lower customer warranty contract sales (See Operating Revenues - Nonutility).  Gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues  decreased 5.0 percentage points due to the significant decline in high-margin warranty contracts and residential installation jobs.For 2010, combined gross margin for the nonutility businesses, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $0.9 million to $60.6 million compared with 2009. This decrease is primarily due to the following:33South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II •Gross margin from the wholesale energy operations of SJRG decreased $21.8 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Excluding the impact of the net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts and the net change in realized gains and losses on all hedges attributed to inventory transactions as discussed above, gross margin for SJRG decreased $5.1 million due mainly to tighter spreads attained on our storage and transportation assets.  These tighter spreads were partially offset by margins derived from increased marketing of Marcellus production gas. Storage assets allow SJRG to lock in the differential between purchasing natural gas at low current prices and selling equivalent quantities at higher future prices. Gross margin is generated via seasonal pricing differentials. While this margin will be attained over the transaction cycle, the timing of physical injections and withdrawals and related hedge settlements can cause earnings fluctuations for accounting purposes due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. During the injection season of 2009, NYMEX prices decreased significantly. Typical to our business cycle, we entered into financial hedges designed to protect our ultimate injection prices at a time when NYMEX prices were relatively high. These contracts settled in the injection months when the NYMEX had fallen considerably and thus produced significant realized hedge losses which were recorded into earnings. During this period we purchased less expensive physical gas that was injected into storage.  During the injection season of 2010, the impact of realized hedge gains/losses recorded into earnings was not significant. Overall, SJRG's contribution to margin from storage and transportation assets has decreased due to market conditions and we have begun to shed some of these assets.  However, we expect to continue to add substantial margin from marketing and related opportunities in the Marcellus region, capitalizing on our established presence in the area.  Future margins could fluctuate significantly due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. Storage and transportation assets under contract as of December 31 are as follows:  201020092008Storage (Bcf)12.512.212.2Transportation (dts/day)83,115153,000124,375  • Gross Margin from on-site energy production at Marina decreased $1.3 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues decreased 5.1 percentage points due mainly to the deconsolidation of ACLE and WCLE as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and an increase in low-margin electric sales to the Borgata. • Gross margin from SJE's retail gas and other operations increased $0.8 million in 2010, compared with 2009. Excluding the impact of a $0.3 million change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts as discussed above, gross margin increased $0.5 million in 2010, compared with 2009, due mainly to incremental margins from new customers acquired in our Pennsylvania retail book which was partially offset by the impact of lower New Jersey customer counts (See Operating Revenues - Nonutility). Gross margins as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly in 2010, compared with 2009. • Gross margin from SJE's retail electric operations increased $21.0 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Excluding the impact of a $18.5 million change in unrealized gains/losses recorded on forward financial contracts, gross margin increased $2.5 million in 2010 compared with 2009. This increase was mainly due to the impact of the school bid and additional customer growth as mentioned in Operating Revenues - Nonutility.  Excluding the impact of the change in unrealized gains/losses, gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly in 2010 compared with 2009.  • Gross margin from the appliance service operations at SJESP increased $0.1 million in 2010 compared with 2009.  Gross margin as a percentage of Operating Revenues did not change significantly between years.34South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIOperations Expense - A summary of net changes in operations expense follows (in thousands):  2011 vs. 20102010 vs. 2009Gas Utility Operations$888$4,728Nonutility:  Wholesale Energy Operations1,1451,625Retail Gas and Other Operations(57)115Retail Electric Operations1,454472On-Site Energy Production670(539)Appliance Service Operations1631,031Total Nonutility3,3752,704Intercompany Eliminations and Other596(456)Total Operations Expense$4,859$6,976 Utility Operations expense increased $0.9 million during 2011, as compared with 2010.  This is the result of increased spending under the New Jersey Clean Energy Program and Energy Efficiency Programs.  Such costs are recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis; therefore, SJG experienced an offsetting increase in revenues during the period. Utility Operations expense increased $4.7 million during 2010, as compared with 2009.  This is the result of increases in expense associated with uncollectible customer accounts receivable, higher bank fees required to support credit availability and the Company's variable-rate debt, along with moderate increases in corporate support, governance, compliance and employee compensation costs.Nonutility Operations expense increased $3.4 million in 2011 compared with 2010 due mainly to additional personnel, governance and compliance costs to support continued growth.  Nonutility  operations expense increased $2.7 million  in 2010 compared with the previous year due mainly to additional personnel, governance and compliance costs to support continued growth. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of ACLE and WCLE, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Other changes in Operations Expense during 2011 and 2010 were not significant. Other Operating Expenses - A summary of changes in other consolidated operating expenses (in thousands):  2011 vs. 20102010 vs. 2009Maintenance$1,572$2,681Depreciation$1,731$2,738Energy and Other Taxes$47$411 Maintenance - Maintenance expense increased $1.6 million during 2011, compared with 2010 due to the BPU-approved amortization and recovery of previously deferred maintenance costs, primarily those associated with a federally mandated pipeline integrity management program.  Maintenance expense increased $2.7 million during 2010, compared with 2009; primarily due to higher levels of Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC) amortization. These costs are recovered from ratepayers; therefore, SJG experienced an offsetting increase in revenue during 2010.   Depreciation Expense - Depreciation increased $1.7 million during 2011 compared with 2010; and $2.7 million during 2010, compared with 2009; due mainly to the increased investment in property, plant and equipment by SJG and Marina. Energy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2011 and 2010 compared with the prior year was not significant.35South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIOther Income and Expense -  Other income and expense increased $11.1 million in 2011 compared to the prior year due to a) interest income on notes receivable from affiliates, and b) proceeds received from a provider of homeowner assistance services, in accordance with an agreement with the Company, that gives them the exclusive right to renew the home appliance repair contracts at SJESP.  Other income and expenses increased $3.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher interest income for notes receivable advances to affiliates. Interest Charges - Interest charges increased $2.2 million  and  $2.9 million in 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior year, respectively. The increase in 2011 was due primarily to higher short-term borrowing levels and interest rates at our non-utility businesses in support of increased project development activity, and interest charges on long term debt that was issued during 2010 at SJG, taken over a full year in 2011.The increase in 2010 was due primarily to higher average levels of short-term debt during 2010, along with the issuance of long-term debt at SJG. Income Taxes - Income tax expense decreased $6.3 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. Income tax expense decreased $11.2 million due to the change in the effective tax rate in 2011 as compared to 2010, which is due to increases in the investment tax credits available on renewable energy facilities at Marina.  This was partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million due to higher pretax income in 2011 compared to 2010.  Income tax expense decreased by $5.5 million for 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the impact of the investment tax credit available on renewable energy facilities at Marina.Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies - Equity in loss of affiliated companies decreased $2.2 million for 2011 as compared to 2010.  This decrease in equity in loss of affiliated companies is primarily due to unrealized gains on interest rate swaps at LVE.  Equity in loss of affiliated companies increased $2.1 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to unrealized losses on interest rate swaps at LVE. Discontinued Operations - The losses are primarily comprised of environmental remediation and product liability litigation associated with previously disposed of businesses.36South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES: Liquidity needs are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge; working capital needs of our energy trading and marketing activities; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; the timing of equity contributions to unconsolidated affiliates; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments. Cash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $191.4 million, $159.1 million and $175.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conservation efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization and gas cost recoveries. Operating activities produced more net cash in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to higher cash collections of non-utility customer accounts receivable balances, improvements in working capital needs as a result of milder winter temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2011, continued lower natural gas prices, and a reduction in required tax payments during 2011. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of two BGSS bill credits posted to customer accounts and higher planned environmental remediation spending at SJG.  Net cash provided by operating activities declined in 2010 as compared with 2009 due to higher accounts receivable balances at the end of 2010 caused by increased commodity marketing activities and the impact of cold weather on natural gas demand; higher prepaid taxes due to a late year tax law change; and high levels of cash produced in 2009 from the liquidation of high priced natural gas in inventory was not repeated in 2010. These factors more than offset an improved recovery of gas costs from customers under our BGSS clause and higher accounts payable due to the increased commodity sales at year end 2010.   Cash Flows from Investing Activities - SJI has a continuing need for cash resources and capital, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. Net cash outflows for capital expenditures, which are primarily construction projects, for 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $193.1 million, $166.9 million and $109.3 million, respectively. We estimate the net cash outflows for construction projects for 2012, 2013 and 2014 to be approximately $181.5 million, $118.0 million and $115.1 million, respectively.  The increase in the 2011 capital expenditures was a direct result of SJG's CIRT program, which began in 2009.  See additional details under “Rates and Regulation.”  For capital expenditures, including those under SJG's CIRT, the Company will use short-term borrowings under lines of credit from commercial banks and the commercial paper program to finance capital expenditures as incurred. From time to time, the Company will refinance the short-term debt incurred to support capital expenditures with long-term debt. In support of its risk management activities, the Company is required to maintain margin accounts with selected counterparties as collateral for its forward contracts, swap agreements, options contracts and futures contracts. These margin accounts are included in Restricted Investments or Margin Account Liability, depending upon the value of the related contracts (the change in the Margin Account Liability is reflected in cash flows from Operating Activities) on the consolidated balance sheets. The required amount of restricted investments changes on a daily basis due to fluctuations in the market value of the related outstanding contracts and are difficult to predict.  Margin posted by the Company increased by $10.3 million during 2011, increased by $3.3 million during 2010 and decreased by $25.9 million during 2009. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made investments in, and provided net advances to, unconsolidated affiliates of $14.6 million, $100.9 million and $27.7 million, respectively. The purpose of these investments and advances was to cover certain project related costs of LVE (See Commitments and Contingencies in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements), to provide working capital for a retail marketing operation, and to develop several landfill gas-fired electric production facilities, solar and thermal energy projects.   Cash Flows from Financing Activities - Short-term borrowings from the commercial paper program and lines of credit from commercial banks are used to supplement cash flows from operations, to support working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures as incurred. From time to time, short-term debt incurred to finance capital expenditures is refinanced with long-term debt. Credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands): 37South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IICompanyTotal FacilityUsageAvailable LiquidityExpiration DateSJG:    Commercial Paper Program/Revolving Credit Facility$200,000$126,600$73,400May 2015Uncommitted Bank Lines20,000—20,000VariousTotal SJG220,000126,60093,400 SJI:    Revolving Credit Facility300,000247,80852,192April 2015 (A)Term Line of Credit30,00030,000—November 2013Total SJI330,000277,80852,192 Total$550,000$404,408$145,592   (A) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $83.0 million. The SJG facilities are restricted as to use and availability specifically to SJG; however, if necessary the SJI facilities can also be used to support SJG's liquidity needs. All committed facilities contain one financial covenant limiting the ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in the respective credit agreements), measured on a quarterly basis. SJI and SJG were in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2011. Borrowings under these credit facilities are at market rates. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings, which changes daily, was 1.12%, 0.99% and 0.77% at December 31, 2011,2010 and 2009, respectively.  Based upon the existing credit facilities and a regular dialogue with our banks, we believe there will continue to be sufficient credit available to meet our business' future liquidity needs.During the third quarter of 2011, SJG began a commercial paper program under which SJG may issue short-term, unsecured promissory notes to qualified investors up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $200.0 million.  The notes have fixed maturities which vary by note, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Proceeds from the notes are used for general corporate purposes.  SJG uses the commercial paper program in tandem with the new $200.0 million revolving credit facility and does not expect the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the credit facility at any time to exceed an aggregate of $200.0 million.SJI supplements its operating cash flow and credit lines with both debt and equity capital. Over the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and Medium Term Notes (MTN), secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. During the third quarter of 2011, SJG entered into an arrangement to issue $35.0 million aggregate principal amount of MTNs under a private placement to occur in April 2012 and repaid $25.0 million of First Mortgage Bonds.  In March, June, and December 2010, SJG issued $15.0 million, $45.0 million and $55.0 million aggregate principal amounts, respectively, of its MTNs under private placements. No other long-term debt was issued during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.  SJG also repaid long-term debt totaling $10.0 million in 2010 and 2009.SJG's $150.0 million Medium Term Note (MTN) program that was approved by the BPU in September 2009 expired in September 2011.  In December 2011, SJG received approval from the NJ BPU to issue up to $200.0 million in long-term debt by September 2014.In February 2012, SJG called its $35.0 million, 7.7% MTN's due April 2027 at par plus a 2.0% premium. The early redemption will occur concurrently with the issuance of $35.0 million, 3.74% MTN's in April 2012, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.38South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI raises equity capital through its Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP).  Participants in SJI's DRP receive newly issued shares, with SJI offering a 2% discount on DRP investments as it has been considered to be the most cost effective way to raise equity capital.  From April 2008 through April 2011, shares of common stock offered by the DRP were purchased in open market transactions.  Beginning in May 2011, shares of common stock offered by the DRP have again been issued at a 2% discount directly by SJI from its authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Through the DRP, SJI raised $13.4 million of equity capital by issuing 259,359 shares in 2011.  No shares were issued by SJI under the DRP in 2010 and 2009. SJI's capital structure was as follows:  As of December 31, 2011 2010Equity45.5% 44.8%Long-Term Debt31.1% 35.5%Short-Term Debt23.4% 19.7%Total100.0% 100.0% The change in the SJI capital structure from 2010 to 2011 is primarily related to repayments of long-term debt at SJG as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, and the issuance of short-term debt to fund capital investments at both SJG and Marina. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, SJI paid quarterly dividends to its common shareholders. SJI has paid dividends on its common stock for 60 consecutive years and has increased that dividend each year for the last eleven years. The Company currently looks to grow that dividend by at least 6% to 7% per year and has a targeted payout ratio of between 50% and 60% of Economic Earnings. In setting the dividend rate, the Board of Directors of SJI considers future earnings expectations, payout ratio, and dividend yield relative to those at peer companies as well as returns available on other income-oriented investments.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to increase the dividend, meet the targeted payout ratio or pay a dividend at all in the future.FINANCE OBLIGATION - During 2010, ACB Energy Partners LLC (ACB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energenic, in which Marina has a 50% equity interest, completed construction of a combined heat and power generating facility to serve, under an energy services agreement, a thermal plant owned by Marina. Construction period financing was provided by Marina. At December 31, 2010, due to its continuing involvement in the facility, Marina was considered the owner of the facility for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company included $20.2 million of costs to construct the facility within Nonutility Property, Plant and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010. In addition, during the first quarter 2011, the Company included an additional $3.3 million of costs to construct the facility within Nonutility Property, Plant and Equipment, and recorded $23.5 million of repayments from ACB to Marina on the construction loan within the Finance Obligation on the consolidated balance sheets.   The costs to construct the facility and the repayments of the construction loan are amortized over the term of the energy services agreement.  As a result, the Company recorded $22.5 million, net of amortization, within Finance Obligation on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2011. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:SJI has a continuing need for cash resources and capital, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment, and for environmental remediation costs.  Cash outflows for capital expenditures for 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $193.1 million, $166.9 million and $109.3 million, respectively.  Management estimates net cash outflows for construction projects for 2012, 2013 and 2014 to be approximately $181.5 million, $118.0 million and $115.1 million, respectively. Costs for remediation projects, net of insurance reimbursements for 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to net cash outflows of $13.6 million, $3.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  Total cash outflows for remediation projects are expected to be approximately $20.4 million, $15.1 million and $10.6 million for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.   As discussed in Notes 10 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, certain environmental costs are subject to recovery from insurance carriers and ratepayers.     39South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT — As of December 31, 2011, SJI provided $83.0 million of standby letters of credit through SJI’s revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the amount of $62.3 million support variable-rate demand bonds issued through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) to finance Marina’s initial thermal plant project and $20.7 million were posted to enable SJE to market retail electricity and for various construction activities. The Company also provided an additional $25.2 million letter of credit under a separate facility outside of the revolving credit facility to support variable-rate demand bonds issued through the NJEDA to finance the expansion of SJG’s natural gas distribution system.  As of December 31, 2010, these bonds were included in the current portion of long-term debt because this letter of credit expired during 2011.  The replacement letter of credit expires in August 2015, and as a result, the related bonds are now included in long-term debt as of December 31, 2011.SJG and SJRG have certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which they pay fees regardless of usage. Those commitments as of December 31, 2011, average $47.5 million annually and total $302.2 million over the contracts' lives.  Approximately 40.2% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years.  These contracts are included in the Company's contractual obligations below. We expect to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all prudently incurred fees through rates via the Basic Gas Supply Service clause.In addition, in the normal course of business, SJG and SJRG have entered into long-term contracts for natural gas supplies.  SJRG has committed to purchase a minimum of 340,000 dts/d and up to 700,000 dts/d of natural gas, from various suppliers, for terms ranging from three to ten years at index-based prices.  SJG has committed to purchase a minimum of 6,250 dts/d and up to 25,000 dts/d of natural gas, from one supplier, for a term of eight years at index-based prices.  The obligations for these purchases has not been included in the Company's contractual obligations discussed below because the actual volumes and prices are not fixed.The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):   Up toYearsYearsMore thanContractual Cash ObligationsTotal1 Year2 & 34 & 55 Years      Long-Term Debt$426,400$2,187$50,375$43,193$330,645Interest on Long-Term Debt272,12321,68941,67737,608171,149Construction Obligations14,70914,709———Operating Leases2,5146451,058628183Commodity Supply Purchase Obligations602,896315,835132,64437,988116,429New Jersey Clean Energy Program (Note 10)12,80212,802———Other Purchase Obligations481481———Total Contractual Cash Obligations$1,331,925$368,348$225,754$119,417$618,406 Interest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity as well as the impact of all interest rate swap agreements.  Expected environmental remediation costs, asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments. SJI made contributions to its employee pension plans totaling $25.0 million in January 2012.  However, future pension contributions beyond 2012 cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.6 million annually to our postretirement benefit plans’ trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which the company has either made guarantees or has certain other interests or obligations. The Company has recorded a liability of $1.9 million which is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities with a corresponding increase in Investment in Affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 for the fair value of the following guarantees:40South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIIn April 2007, SJI guaranteed certain obligations of LVE Energy Partners, LLC (LVE) an unconsolidated joint venture in which Marina has a 50% equity interest.  LVE entered into a 25-year contract with a resort developer to design, build, own and operate a district energy system and central energy center for a planned resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.  LVE began construction of the facility in 2007 and expected to provide full energy service in 2010 when the resort was originally scheduled to be completed.  LVE suspended construction of the district energy system and central energy center in January 2009 after the resort developer’s August 2008 announcement that it was delaying the completion of construction of the resort due to the difficult environment in the capital markets and weak economic conditions.  The resort developer had indicated that it was considering different strategies to move its project forward, including opening its project in phases and obtaining a partner, but that it was unlikely construction would resume during 2009.  In November 2011, the resort developer, repeating previous disclosures, indicated again that it does not expect to resume construction on the project for three to five years.  The resort developer stated that it remains committed to having a significant presence on the Las Vegas Strip as part of a long-term growth strategy and continues to view this site as a major strategic asset.The district energy system and central energy center are being financed by LVE with debt that is non-recourse to SJI. The outstanding balance of LVE’s bank debt is approximately $193.0 million as of December 31, 2011.  As a result of the construction delay, the district energy system and central energy center were not completed by the end of 2010 as originally expected. Consequently, the full amount of LVE’s debt became due and payable in December 2010. LVE intends to seek additional financing to complete the facility once construction of the resort resumes, however, as of December 31, 2010, LVE was in default under the financing agreements with the banks.  The Energy Sales Agreement between LVE and the resort developer includes a payment obligation by the resort developer to pay certain fees and expenses to LVE. A portion of this payment obligation is guaranteed to LVE’s lenders by the parent of the resort developer.In March 2011, LVE reached agreements with (a) the resort developer, that specified the payments to be made by the developer to LVE during the suspension period and provided the developer and its corporate parent with an option to purchase the assets of LVE, and (b) the banks that are financing the energy facilities to address the existing default under the financing agreements. The terms of the March 2011 agreement require the resort developer to pay certain fees and expenses to LVE on a monthly basis beginning in March 2011 until construction of the resort resumes or until the resort developer has exercised its option to purchase the energy facilities from LVE. The monthly payments that are being paid to LVE by the resort developer are expected to be sufficient to reimburse LVE for costs to maintain the energy facilities and to cover debt service costs over time. The resort developer has provided LVE with a $6.0 million letter of credit to support its monthly payment obligation.The banks that are financing the energy facilities have agreed not to exercise their rights under the financing agreements resulting from the event of default discussed above through December 2013, provided that no additional events of default occur. SJI and its joint venture partner have provided a total of $10.0 million in letters of credit to the banks to support LVE’s obligations, which can be drawn upon by the banks at the end of the existing agreement in December 2013 or upon the occurrence of an event of default by LVE prior to December 2013.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a net liability of approximately $1.6 million included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets related to this project, in addition to unsecured Notes Receivable – Affiliate of approximately $57.5 million due from LVE. As of December 31, 2011, SJI’s capital at risk is limited to its equity contributions, letters of credit and the unsecured notes receivable totaling approximately $70.9 million. During 2011, SJI provided support to LVE of approximately $6.1 million to cover interest and other project related costs.As a result of the construction delay, management has evaluated the investment in LVE and concluded that the fair value of this investment continues to be in excess of the carrying value as of December 31, 2011.SJI has guaranteed certain performance obligations of LVE under the operating agreements between LVE and the resort developer, up to $20.0 million each year for the term of the agreement, commencing with the first year of operations.  SJI and its partner in this joint venture have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI on this guarantee.41South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI has guaranteed certain obligations of BC Landfill Energy, LLC (BCLE) and WC Landfill Energy, LLC (WCLE), unconsolidated joint ventures in which Marina has a 50% equity interest through Energenic. BCLE and WCLE have entered into agreements ranging from 15-20 years with the respective county governments to lease and operate facilities that will produce electricity from landfill methane gas.  Although unlikely, the maximum amount that SJI could be obligated for, in the event that BCLE and WCLE do not meet minimum specified levels of operating performance and no mitigating action is taken, or are unable to meet certain financial obligations as they become due, is approximately $4.2 million each year.  SJI and its partner in these joint ventures have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI on these guarantees.  SJI holds variable interests in BCLE and WCLE but is not the primary beneficiary.As of December 31, 2011, SJI had issued $4.9 million of parental guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated subsidiary. These guarantees generally expire within the next two years and were issued to enable our subsidiary to market retail natural gas.CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION -  In February 2011, ACR Energy Partners, LLC (ACR), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energenic, of which Marina has a 50% equity interest, entered into a 20 year contract with a developer to build, own and operate a central energy center and energy distribution system for a planned hotel, casino and entertainment complex in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  ACR is currently providing construction energy to the complex and will provide full energy services when the complex is completed in 2012.  The contract calls for Marina and its joint venture partner to make capital contributions to ACR that will enable ACR to a) repay $42.0 million of construction advances made by the developer and b) deposit $2.8 million in a debt service reserve fund, provided, in each case, that the developer has met certain conditions. These conditions include, among others, substantial completion of the complex and demonstration of adequate financial resources to operate the complex. Marina and its joint venture partner have also agreed to provide a $5.0 million letter of credit in 2012 to support certain operating performance obligations of ACR under the operating agreements between ACR and the developer, provided the developer has met the conditions just outlined. SJI and its partner in this joint venture have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI to or on behalf of ACR.  In February 2012, Marina made a capital contribution of $16.3 million to ACR.  Marina is expected to make an additional capital contribution of $4.7 million in March 2012.PENDING LITIGATION - The Company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business and other legal proceedings. The Company has been named in, among other actions, certain product liability claims related to our former sand mining subsidiary. We accrue liabilities related to these claims when we can reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of probable settlement costs or other charges for these claims. The Company has accrued approximately $2.9 million and $4.2 million related to all claims in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a material change in the Company's estimated liability in the near term and does not currently anticipate the disposition of any known claims that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.MARKET RISKS: Commodity Market Risks - Certain regulated and nonregulated SJI subsidiaries are involved in buying, selling, transporting and storing natural gas and buying and selling retail electricity for their own accounts as well as managing these activities for other third parties. These subsidiaries are subject to market risk due to price fluctuations. To hedge against this risk, we enter into a variety of physical and financial transactions including forward contracts, swaps, futures and options agreements. To manage these transactions, SJI has a well-defined risk management policy approved by our Board of Directors that includes volumetric and monetary limits. Management reviews reports detailing activity daily. Generally, the derivative activities described above are entered into for risk management purposes. SJG and SJE transact commodities on a physical basis and typically do not enter into financial derivative positions directly. SJRG manages risk in the natural gas markets for these entities as well as for its own portfolio by entering into the types of transactions noted above. As part of its gas purchasing strategy, SJG uses financial contracts through SJRG to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through SJG's BGSS, subject to BPU approval. It is management's policy, to the extent practical, within predetermined risk management policy guidelines, to have limited unmatched positions on a deal or portfolio basis while conducting these activities. As a result of holding open positions to a minimal level, the economic impact of changes in value of a particular transaction is substantially offset by an opposite change in the related hedge transaction. 42South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI has entered into certain contracts to buy, sell, and transport natural gas and to buy and sell retail electricity.  For those derivatives not designated as hedges, we recorded the net unrealized pre-tax gain (loss) of $5.4 million, $(22.6) million and $(14.8) million in earnings during the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are included with realized gains and losses in Operating Revenues - Nonutility.  The fair value and maturity of these energy-trading contracts determined under the mark-to-market method as of December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands): Assets    Source of Fair ValueMaturity< 1 YearMaturity1 - 3 YearsMaturityBeyond3 YearsTotal     Prices actively quoted$21,801$2,888$—$24,689     Prices provided by other external sources12,3774,1594616,582     Prices based on internal models or other valuation methods3,2831,042—4,325     Total$37,461$8,089$46$45,596     Liabilities    Source of Fair ValueMaturity < 1 YearMaturity 1 - 3 YearsMaturityBeyond 3 YearsTotal     Prices actively quoted$19,390$3,105$—$22,495     Prices provided by other external sources10,2463,0493213,327     Prices based on internal models or other valuation methods9,1021,181—10,283     Total$38,738$7,335$32$46,105 NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas is traded. Basis represents the price of a NYMEX natural gas futures contract adjusted for the difference in price for delivering the gas at another location. Contracted volumes of our NYMEX contracts included in the table above are 3.5 million dekatherms (dts) with a weighted-average settlement price of $4.57 per dt.  Contracted volumes of our basis contracts included in the table above are 16.2 million dts with a weighted average settlement price of $0.57 per dt.  Contracted volumes of electric included in the table above are 0.6 million mwh with a weighted average settlement price of $54.30 per mwh. A reconciliation of SJI's estimated net fair value of energy-related derivatives follows (in thousands): Net Derivatives - Energy Related Assets,  January 1, 2011$131Contracts Settled During 2011, Net2,783Other Changes in Fair Value from Continuing and New Contracts, Net(3,423)  Net Derivatives - Energy Related Liabilities,  December 31, 2011$(509) Interest Rate Risk - Our exposure to interest-rate risk relates primarily to short-term, variable-rate borrowings. Short-term, variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 was $321.4 million and averaged $228.9 million during 2011. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1%) increase in interest rates on our average variable-rate debt outstanding would result in a $1.4 million increase in our annual interest expense, net of tax. The 100 basis point increase was chosen for illustrative purposes, as it provides a simple basis for calculating the impact of interest rate changes under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Over the past five years, the change in basis points (b.p.) of our average monthly interest rates from the beginning to end of each year was as follows:  2011 - 33 b.p. increase; 2010 - 13 b.p. decrease; 2009 - 29 b.p. decrease; 2008 - 397 b.p. decrease; and 2007 - 45 b.p. decrease.  For December 2011, our average interest rate on variable-rate debt was  1.07%.43South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIWe issue long-term debt either at fixed rates or use interest rate derivatives to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable-rate, long-term debt. As of December 31, 2011, the interest costs on all but $27.1 million of our long-term debt was either at a fixed-rate or hedged via an interest rate derivative. Consequently, interest expense on existing long-term debt is not significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, SJI's active interest rate swaps were as follows: Notional Amount Fixed Interest Rate Start Date Maturity Type of Debt Obligor$3,900,000 4.795% 12/1/2004 12/1/2014 Taxable Marina$8,000,000 4.775% 11/12/2004 11/12/2014 Taxable Marina$14,500,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$500,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$330,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$7,100,000 4.895% 2/1/2006 2/1/2016 Taxable Marina$12,500,000 3.430% 12/1/2006 2/1/2036 Tax-exempt SJG$12,500,000 3.430% 12/1/2006 2/1/2036 Tax-exempt SJG Credit Risk - As of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.5 million, or 36.2%, of the current and noncurrent Derivatives – Energy Related Assets are with a single retail counterparty. This counterparty has contracts with a large number of diverse customers which minimizes the concentration of this risk. A portion of these contracts may be assigned to SJI in the event of a default by the counterparty. As of December 31, 2011, SJRG had $68.1 million of Accounts Receivable under sales contracts. Of that total, 85% were with regulated utilities or companies rated investment-grade or guaranteed by an investment-grade-rated parent or were with companies where we have a collateral arrangement or insurance coverage. The remainder of the Accounts Receivable were within approved credit limits.Item 7A.

South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company) currently provides a variety of energy related products and services primarily through the following subsidiaries:▪South Jersey Gas Company (SJG) is a regulated natural gas utility. SJG distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey.▪South Jersey Resources Group, LLC (SJRG) markets wholesale natural gas storage, commodity and transportation in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.▪Marina Energy, LLC (Marina) develops and operates on-site energy-related projects.▪South Jersey Energy Company (SJE) acquires and markets natural gas and electricity to retail end users and provides total energy management services to commercial and industrial customers.▪South Jersey Energy Service Plus, LLC (SJESP) installs residential and small commercial HVAC systems, provides plumbing services and services appliances under warranty via a subcontractor arrangement.▪South Jersey Exploration, LLC (SJEX) owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.  SJEX was a wholly owned subsidiary of SJRG until November 2011, when it became a wholly owned subsidiary of South Jersey Energy Solutions, LLC (SJES).BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SJI, its wholly owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest. We eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. In management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments needed to fairly present SJI's financial position and operating results at the dates and for the periods presented.  Marina and a joint venture partner formed AC Landfill Energy, LLC (ACLE) and WC Landfill Energy, LLC (WCLE) to develop and install methane-to-electric power generation systems at certain county-owned landfills. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Company accounted for these entities as consolidated subsidiaries. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The new accounting guidance for VIEs considers if a company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE. A controlling financial interest will have both (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE. Marina and the joint venture partner of ACLE and WCLE share the executive board seats and their voting rights equally and equally approve the annual budgets of both entities. Based on the shared control of operations, management concluded as of January 1, 2010 that the Company is no longer the primary beneficiary of ACLE and WCLE as defined by the new accounting guidance. As a result, ACLE and WCLE are no longer accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, ACLE and WCLE are included with other equity investments in Investment in Affiliates on the consolidated balance sheet. The results of operations of ACLE and WCLE for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are included in Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies on the consolidated statements of income. The adoption of this guidance modified our financial statement presentation, but did not have an impact on our financial statement results. EQUITY INVESTMENTS - Marketable equity securities that are purchased as long-term investments are classified as Available-for-Sale Securities and carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. Any unrealized gains or losses are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. SJI, through wholly owned subsidiaries, holds significant variable interests in several companies but is not the primary beneficiary.  Consequently, these investments are accounted for under the equity method. In the event that losses and/or distributions from these equity method investments exceed the carrying value, and the Company is obligated to provide additional financial support, the excess will be recorded as either a current or non-current liability on the consolidated balance sheets. We include the operations of these affiliated companies on a pre-tax basis in the statements of consolidated income under Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies (See Note 3).  An impairment loss is recorded when there is clear evidence that a decline in value is other than temporary.  No impairment losses were recorded on Investments during 2011, 2010 or 2009.53South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS - We prepare our consolidated financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include amounts related to regulatory accounting, energy derivatives, environmental remediation costs, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and revenue recognition. REGULATION - SJG is subject to the rules and regulations of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). See Note 10 for a detailed discussion of SJG's rate structure and regulatory actions. SJG maintains its accounts according to the BPU's prescribed Uniform System of Accounts. SJG follows the accounting for regulated enterprises prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 980 -”Regulated Operations.”  In general, Topic 980 allows for the deferral of certain costs (regulatory assets) and creation of certain obligations (regulatory liabilities) when it is probable that such items will be recovered from or refunded to customers in future periods. See Note 11 for a detailed discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities. OPERATING REVENUES - Gas and electric revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered to customers. For SJG and SJE retail customers that are not billed at the end of the month, we record an estimate to recognize unbilled revenues for gas and electricity delivered from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the month. SJRG's gas revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered. Unrealized gains and losses on energy related derivative instruments are also recognized in operating revenues for SJRG. See further discussion under Derivative Instruments. We recognize revenues related to SJESP appliance service contracts seasonally over the full term of the contracts. Revenue related to services provided on a time and materials basis is recognized on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Marina recognizes revenue on a monthly basis as services are provided, as lease income is earned, and for on-site energy production that is delivered to its customers.REVENUE BASED TAXES — SJI collects certain revenue-based energy taxes from customers. Such taxes include New Jersey State Sales Tax, Transitional Energy Facility Assessment (TEFA) and Public Utilities Assessment (PUA). State sales tax is recorded as a liability when billed to customers and is not included in revenue or operating expenses. TEFA and PUA are included in both utility revenue and cost of sales and totaled $8.0 million, $8.6 million, and $8.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS - Accounts receivable are carried at the amount owed by customers. A provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on our collection experience and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - For regulatory purposes, utility plant is stated at original cost, which may be different than SJG's cost if the assets were acquired from another regulated entity. Nonutility plant is stated at cost. The cost of adding, replacing and renewing property is charged to the appropriate plant account. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS - The amounts included under Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) are primarily related to the legal obligations the Company has to cut and cap gas distribution pipelines when taking those pipelines out of service in future years. These liabilities are generally recognized upon the acquisition or construction of the asset. The related asset retirement cost is capitalized concurrently by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset by the same amount as the liability. Changes in the liability are recorded for the passage of time (accretion) or for revisions to cash flows originally estimated to settle the ARO. ARO activity was as follows (in thousands):   2011 2010   AROs as of January 1, 27,965 23,229Accretion 1,398 481Additions 460 242Settlements (872) (29)Revisions in Estimated Cash Flows (A) 479 4,273Deconsolidation (B) — (231)ARO's as of December 31, 29,430 27,965(A) A corresponding increase was made to Regulatory Assets, thus having no impact on earnings.(B) Reduction resulting from the deconsolidation of ACLE and WCLE as discussed above. 54South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIDEPRECIATION - We depreciate utility plant on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining lives of the various property classes. These estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted as required after BPU approval. The composite annual rate for all depreciable utility property was approximately 2.3% in 2011, 2.4% in 2010, and 2.3% in 2009. The actual composite rate may differ from the approved rate as the asset mix changes over time. Except for retirements outside of the normal course of business, accumulated depreciation is charged with the cost of depreciable utility property retired, less salvage. Nonutility property depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the property, ranging up to 50 years. Gain or loss on the disposition of nonutility property is recognized in operating income. CAPITALIZED INTEREST - SJG capitalizes interest on construction at the rate of return on the rate base utilized by the BPU to set rates in its last base rate proceeding (See Note 10). Marina capitalizes interest on construction projects in progress based on the actual cost of borrowed funds. SJG's amounts are included in Utility Plant and Marina's amounts are included in Nonutility Property and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest Charges are presented net of capitalized interest on the consolidated statements of income.  The amount of interest capitalized by SJI for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1.2 million.  The amount of interest capitalized by SJI for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was not significant. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such amounts may not be recoverable. For the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, no significant impairments were identified. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - SJI accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815 - “Derivatives and Hedging.”  We record all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless the derivative contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exemption. In general, if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, we recognize the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in earnings. We currently have no fair value hedges. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, we record the effective portion of the hedge in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and recognize it in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. We recognize ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges immediately in earnings. Currently, we do not designate energy-related derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness. All hedging instruments are linked to the hedged asset, liability, firm commitment or forecasted transaction. Due to the application of regulatory accounting principles under FASB ASC Topic 980, gains and losses on derivatives related to SJG's gas purchases are recorded through the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) clause. Initially and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged items. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we decide to discontinue the hedging relationship; determine that the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur; or determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, we will continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its current fair value and recognize subsequent changes in fair value in current period earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on the discontinued hedges that were previously included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs, or when it is probable that it will not occur. GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT - The Company capitalizes all costs associated with gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities under the full cost method of accounting. Capitalized costs include costs related to unproved properties, which are not amortized until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired. All costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. As of December 30, 2011 and 2010, $9.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, related to interests in proved and unproved properties in Pennsylvania, net of amortization, are included with Nonutility Property and Equipment and Other Noncurrent Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. TREASURY STOCK – SJI uses the par value method of accounting for treasury stock. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, SJI held 154,718 and 143,546 shares of treasury stock, respectively. These shares are related to deferred compensation arrangements where the amounts earned are held in the stock of SJI.INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for all significant temporary differences between the book and taxable bases of assets and liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 - “Income Taxes” (See Note 4). A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Investment tax credits related to renewable energy facilities of the non-regulated entities are recognized on the flow through method. 55South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IICASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - For purposes of reporting cash flows, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during 2011, 2010 or 2009 had, or is expected to have, a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. Accordingly, companies needed to carefully reconsider previous conclusions, including (1) whether an entity is a VIE, (2) whether the company is the VIE's primary beneficiary, and (3) what type of financial statement disclosures are required. The new guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.  As a result of adopting this guidance, we have deconsolidated ACLE and WCLE as of January 1, 2010 due to the shared control between the Company and the joint venture partner as discussed under “Basis of Presentation” above. Beginning January 1, 2010, ACLE and WCLE are reported using the equity method of accounting. The adoption of this guidance modified our financial statement presentation, but did not have an impact on our financial statement results.In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This ASU amends ASC Topic 820 to include a consistent definition of the term “fair value” and set forth common requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements in financial statements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial statement results.In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.  This ASU allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.  ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.  In January 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12,  Deferral of the Effective Date for the Presentation of Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which defers the provisions related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The other portions of the ASU remain unchanged and will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.   The adoption of this guidance will modify our financial statement presentation, but will not have an impact on our financial statement results.In January 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Enhanced Disclosure Requirements Concerning Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This ASU amends ASC 210-20 to add disclosure requirements in respect of the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013.  Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.2.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN:Under the Amended and Restated 1997 Stock-Based Compensation Plan, no more than 2,000,000 shares in the aggregate may be issued to SJI’s officers (Officers), non-employee directors (Directors) and other key employees. The plan will terminate on January 26, 2015, unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. No options were granted or outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.   No stock appreciation rights have been issued under the plan. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, SJI granted 40,711, 52,940, and 41,437 restricted shares to Officers and other key employees, respectively.   These restricted shares vest over a three-year period and are subject to SJI achieving certain market-based performance targets as compared to a peer group average, which can cause the actual amount of shares that ultimately vest to range from between 0% to 150% of the original share units granted.  SJI granted 12,220, 16,700, and 9,559 restricted shares to Directors in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Shares issued to Directors vest over a three-year service period and contain no performance conditions. As a result, 100% of the shares granted generally vest pending the satisfaction of the service condition. As the vesting requirements for officers and other key employees under the plan are contingent upon market and service conditions, SJI is required to measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value at the date of grant for its share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. In addition, SJI identifies specific forfeitures of share-based awards and compensation expense is adjusted accordingly over the requisite service period.56South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II Compensation expense is not adjusted based on the actual achievement of performance goals. The Company estimated the fair value of Officers' restricted stock awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.The following table summarizes the nonvested restricted stock awards outstanding at December 31, 2011 and the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the awards: Grant Date Shares Outstanding Fair Value Per Share Expected Volatility Risk-Free Interest RateOfficers & Key Employees -Jan. 2010 52,508 $39.020 29.0% 1.65% Jan. 2011 40,399 $50.940 27.5% 1.01%        Directors -Jan. 2010 13,360 $37.825 — — Jan. 2011 8,554 $52.940 — —Expected volatility is based on the actual volatility of SJI’s share price over the preceding three-year period as of the valuation date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Bond, with a term equal to the three-year term of the Officers’ and other key employees’ restricted shares. As notional dividend equivalents are credited to the holders, during the three-year service period, no reduction to the fair value of the award is required. As the Directors’ restricted stock awards contain no performance conditions and dividends are paid or credited to the holder during the three-year service period, the fair value of these awards are equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.The following table summarizes the total stock-based compensation cost for the years ended -December 31, (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009Officers & Key Employees$1,852 $1,628 $1,322Directors658 394 330Total Cost2,510 2,022 1,652      Capitalized(218) (202) (171)Net Expense$2,292 $1,820 $1,481As of December 31, 2011, there was $2.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation awards granted under the restricted stock plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.The following table summarizes information regarding restricted stock award activity during 2011, excluding accrued dividend equivalents: Officers & Other Key Employees Directors WeightedAverageFair ValueNonvested Shares Outstanding, January 1, 201190,688 25,390 $39.049Granted40,711 12,220 $51.407Vested*(37,748) (14,474) $40.041Cancelled/Forfeited(744) (1,222) $49.707Nonvested Shares Outstanding, December 31, 201192,907 21,914 $44.112*Actual shares expected to be awarded to officers and other key employees during the first quarter of 2012, including dividend equivalents and adjustments for performance measures, total 33,322 shares.    57South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIDuring the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, SJI awarded 69,271 shares to its Officers and other key employees at a market value of $3.7 million, 59,893 shares at a market value of $2.3 million, and 57,976 shares at a market value of $2.3 million, respectively. Also, during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, SJI awarded 12,220, 16,700 and 9,559 shares to its Directors at a market value of $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The Company has a policy of issuing new shares to satisfy its obligations under these plans; therefore, there are no cash payment requirements resulting from the normal operation of this plan. However, a change in control could result in such shares becoming nonforfeitable or immediately payable in cash.  At the discretion of the Officers, Directors and other key employees, the receipt of vested shares can be deferred until future periods.  These deferred shares are included in Treasury Stock on the consolidated balance sheets.3.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AFFILATIONS:DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - Discontinued Operations consist of the environmental remediation activities related to the properties of South Jersey Fuel, Inc. (SJF) and the product liability litigation and environmental remediation activities related to the prior business of The Morie Company, Inc. (Morie). SJF is a subsidiary of Energy & Minerals, Inc. (EMI), an SJI subsidiary, which previously operated a fuel oil business. Morie is the former sand mining and processing subsidiary of EMI. EMI sold the common stock of Morie in 1996.SJI conducts tests annually to estimate the environmental remediation costs for these properties.Summarized operating results of the discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, were (in thousands, except per share amounts): 2011 2010 2009Loss before Income Taxes:     Sand Mining$(169) $(440) $(289)Fuel Oil(701) (530) (362)Income Tax Benefits302 337 224Loss from Discontinued Operations — Net$(568) $(633) $(427)Earnings Per Common Share from     Discontinued Operations — Net:     Basic$(0.02) $(0.02) $(0.02)Diluted$(0.02) $(0.03) $(0.02)AFFILIATIONS — The following affiliated entities are accounted for under the equity method:Marina and a joint venture partner formed the following entities in which Marina has a 50% equity interest:LVE Energy Partners, LLC (LVE), which has entered into a contract to design, build, own and operate a district energy system and central energy center for a planned resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.Energenic – US, LLC (Energenic), which develops and operates on-site, self-contained, energy-related projects.During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made investments in, and provided net advances to, unconsolidated affiliates of $14.6 million, $100.9 million and $27.7 million, respectively. The purpose of these investments and advances was to cover certain project related costs of LVE (See Note 15), to provide working capital for a retail marketing operation, and to develop several landfill gas-fired electric production facilities, solar and thermal energy projects.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding balance on these Notes Receivable – Affiliate was $114.7 million and $127.9 million, respectively. Approximately $57.2 million of these notes are secured by property, plant and equipment of the affiliates, accrue interest at 7.5% and are to be repaid through 2025. The remaining $57.5 million of these notes are unsecured, and are either non-interest bearing or accrue interest at variable rates and are to be repaid when the affiliate secures permanent financing.    58South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI holds significant variable interests in these entities but is not the primary beneficiary. Consequently, these entities are accounted for under the equity method because SJI does not have both a) the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a net asset of approximately $29.9 million included in Investment in Affiliates and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets related to equity method investees, in addition to Notes Receivable – Affiliate as discussed above. SJI’s maximum exposure to loss from these entities as of December 31, 2011 is limited to its combined equity contributions and the Notes Receivable-Affiliate in the amount of $147.6 million.The following tables present summarized financial information of the total balances for all Affiliates (of which, on average, SJI has only a 50% equity interest) accounted for under the equity method (in thousands): 20112010Current assets $26,390 $1,926Noncurrent assets $625,556 $388,780Current liabilities $71,375 $50,501Noncurrent liabilities $540,166 $352,577 201120102009Revenues $95,647 $75,476 $10,638Cost of sales $64,181 $52,187 $—Net Income (loss) $1,522 $(3,536) $444SJI and a joint venture partner formed Potato Creek, LLC (Potato Creek) in which SJI has a 30% equity interest.  Potato Creek owns and manages the oil, gas and mineral rights of certain real estate in Pennsylvania.  During the third quarter of 2011, Potato Creek agreed to sell certain natural gas production assets in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, the purchaser terminated the pending transaction.  Potato Creek, and its partners, intend to pursue all remedies available under the agreements.59South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II4.INCOME TAXES: SJI files a consolidated federal income tax return.

There have been no significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits during 2011, 2010 or 2009 and the Company does not anticipate any significant changes in the total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. The unrecognized tax benefits are primarily related to an uncertainty of state income taxes.  Federal income tax returns from 2008 forward and state income tax returns primarily from 2007 forward are open and subject to examination.5.PREFERRED STOCK: REDEEMABLE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK - SJI has 2,500,000 authorized shares of Preference Stock, no par value, which has not been issued.6.COMMON STOCK:The following shares were issued and outstanding at December 31: 2011 2010 2009Beginning of Year29,872,825 29,796,232 29,728,697New Issues During Year:     Dividend Reinvestment Plan259,359 — —Stock-Based Compensation Plan80,269 76,593 67,535End of Year30,212,453 29,872,825 29,796,232The par value ($1.25 per share) of stock issued was recorded in Common Stock and the net excess over par value at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 of approximately $16.0 million, $2.8 million, and $2.0 million, respectively, was recorded in Premium on Common Stock.EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) — Basic EPS is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  The incremental shares required for inclusion in the denominator for the diluted EPS calculation were 86,031, 112,551,  and 107,333 shares for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  These shares relate to SJI’s restricted stock as discussed in Note 2.DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (DRP) —The Company offers a DRP which allows participating shareholders to purchase shares of SJI common stock by the automatic reinvestment of dividends or optional purchases. From April 2008 through April 2011, shares of common stock offered by the DRP have been purchased in open market transactions.  Beginning in May 2011, shares of common stock offered by the DRP have been issued directly by SJI from its authorized but unissued shares of common stock.7.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS — In accordance with the terms of the Marina and certain SJG loan agreements, unused proceeds are required to be escrowed pending approval of construction expenditures. As of both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the escrowed proceeds, including interest earned, totaled $1.3 million.The Company maintains margin accounts with selected counterparties to support its risk management activities. The balances required to be held in these margin accounts increase as the net value of the outstanding energy related contracts with the respective counterparties decrease. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the balances in these accounts totaled $17.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The carrying amounts of the Restricted Investments approximate their fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010.62South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IILONG-TERM RECEIVABLES — SJG provides financing to customers for the purpose of attracting conversions to natural gas heating systems from competing fuel sources.  The terms of these loans call for customers to make monthly payments over a period of up to five years with no interest.  The carrying amounts of such loans were $11.7 million and $10.4 million as of  December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The current portion of these receivables is reflected in Accounts Receivable and the non-current portion is reflected in Contract Receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amounts noted above are net of unamortized discounts resulting from imputed interest in the amount of $1.2 million as of  both December 31, 2011 and 2010.  The annual amortization to interest is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   The carrying amounts of these receivables approximate their fair value at December 31, 2011 and 2010.CREDIT RISK - As of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.5 million or 36.2% of current and noncurrent Derivatives–Energy Related Assets are with a single counterparty. This counterparty has contracts with a large number of diverse customers which minimizes the concentration of this risk. A portion of these contracts may be assigned to SJI in the event of default by the counterparty.FINANCE OBLIGATION - During 2010, ACB Energy Partners LLC (ACB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energenic, of which Marina has a 50% equity interest, completed construction of a combined heat and power generating facility to serve, under an energy services agreement, a thermal plant owned by Marina. Construction period financing was provided by Marina. At December 31, 2010, due to its continuing involvement in the facility, Marina was considered the owner of the facility for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company included $20.2 million of costs to construct the facility within Nonutility Property, Plant and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010. In addition, during the first quarter 2011, the Company included an additional $3.3 million of costs to construct the facility, and recorded $23.5 million of repayments from ACB to Marina on the construction loan within the Finance Obligation on the consolidated balance sheets.  The costs to construct the facility and the repayments of the construction loan are amortized over the term of the energy services agreement.  As a result, the Company recorded $22.5 million, net of amortization, within Finance Obligation on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2011.OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – The carrying amounts of SJI’s other financial instruments approximate their fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010.8.SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS:SJI operates in several different reportable operating segments which reflect the financial information regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker.

The $42.1 million includes $16.6 million of revenue previously recovered through the Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) and $6.8 million of revenues previously recovered through the Capital Investment Recovery Tracker (CIRT), resulting in incremental revenue of $18.7 million.  SJG was permitted to recover regulatory assets contained in its petition and defer certain federally mandated pipeline integrity management program costs for recovery in its next base rate case.  In addition, annual depreciation expense will be reduced by $1.2 million as a result of the amortization of excess cost of removal recoveries.  The BPU also authorized a Phase II of the base rate proceeding to review the costs of CIRT projects not rolled into rate base in the September 2010 settlement. RATE MECHANISMS - SJG's tariff, a schedule detailing the terms, conditions and rate information applicable to the various types of natural gas service, as approved by the BPU, has several primary rate mechanisms as discussed in detail below: Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) Clause - The BGSS price structure was approved by the BPU in January 2003, and allows SJG to recover all prudently incurred gas costs. BGSS charges to customers can be either monthly or periodic (annual). Monthly BGSS charges are applicable to large use customers and are referred to as monthly because the rate changes on a monthly basis pursuant to a BPU-approved formula based on commodity market prices. Periodic BGSS charges are applicable to lower usage customers, which include all of SJG's residential customers, and are evaluated at least annually by the BPU. However, to some extent, more frequent rate changes to the periodic BGSS are allowed. SJG collects gas costs from customers on a forecasted basis and defers periodic over/underrecoveries to the following BGSS year, which runs from October 1 though September 30. If SJG is in a net cumulative undercollected position, gas costs deferrals are reflected on the balance sheet as a regulatory asset. If SJG is in a net cumulative overcollected position, amounts due back to customers are reflected on the balance sheet as a regulatory liability. SJG pays interest on net overcollected BGSS balances at the rate of return on rate base utilized by the BPU to set rates in the last base rate proceeding. Regulatory actions regarding the BGSS were as follows: • June 2009 - SJG made its annual BGSS filing to the BPU requesting a $54.7 million reduction, or 17.5% decrease, in gas cost recoveries in response to projected decreases in wholesale gas costs. • August 2009 - The BPU issued an Order finalizing the 2008-2009 provisional BGSS costs. • September 2009 - The BPU approved, on a provisional basis, SJG's request for a $54.7 million, or 17.5%, reduction in gas cost recoveries. • June 2010 - SJG made its annual BGSS filing to the BPU requesting a $38.0 million, or a 13.9%, reduction in gas cost recoveries in response to projected decreases in wholesale gas costs. • September 2010 - The BPU approved, on a provisional basis, SJG's request for a $38.0 million, or 13.9%, reduction in gas cost recoveries. • March 2011 - SJG credited the accounts of its periodic BGSS customers with refunds totaling $21.1 million due to gas costs that were lower than projected during the winter season. • June 2011 - SJG filed its annual BGSS filing with the BPU requesting a $10.6 million, or 2.9%, reduction in rates commencing on October 1, 2011. • September 2011 - The BPU issued an Order finalizing the 2010-2011 provisional BGSS rate and approved, on a provisional basis, SJG's request for a $10.6 million or 2.9% reduction in gas cost recoveries. • December 2011 - SJG credited the accounts of its periodic BGSS customers with refunds totaling $18.7 million due to gas costs that were lower than projections.Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) - The primary purpose of the CIP is to promote conservation efforts, without negatively impacting financial stability and to base SJG's profit margin on the number of customers rather than the amount of natural gas distributed to customers. In October 2006, the BPU approved SJG's CIP as a three year pilot program. In January 2010, the BPU approved an extension of this program through September 2013.  Each CIP year begins October 1 and ends September 30 of the subsequent year. On a monthly basis during the CIP year, SJG records adjustments to earnings based on weather and customer usage factors, as incurred. Subsequent to each year, SJG will make filings with the BPU to review and approve amounts recorded under the CIP. BPU approved cash inflows or outflows generally will not begin until the next CIP year. Regulatory actions regarding the CIP were as follows:66South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II • June 2009 - SJG made its annual CIP filing to the BPU requesting recovery of $13.4 million, which included a $13.7 million non-weather related recovery, partially offset by a credit of $0.3 million which was weather related. • August 2009 - The BPU issued an Order finalizing the 2008-2009 provisional CIP rates. • September 2009 - The BPU approved, on a provisional basis, the recovery of CIP revenue of $13.4 million. • June 2010 - SJG made its annual CIP filing to the BPU requesting recovery of $20.0 million which included a $14.4 million non-weather related recovery and $5.6 million which was weather related.  The BGSS savings to be applied as an offset to the non-weather related recovery totaled $8.9 million.  As a result, SJG will carry forward $5.5 million to be recovered from customers in the next CIP year. • September 2010 - The BPU approved, on a provisional basis, the recovery of CIP revenue of $14.5 million. • June 2011 - SJG made its annual CIP filing to the BPU requesting recovery of $2.5 million, which includes a $2.7 million credit to customers for the current 2011-2012 CIP year and prior year carryovers of $5.2 million.  The CIP credit of $2.7 million, includes $1.3 million non-weather related credits and $1.4 million weather related credits. • September 2011 - The BPU issued an Order finalizing the 2010-2011 provisional CIP rates and also approved, on a provisional basis, the 2011-2012 CIP rates filed in June 2011, effective October 1, 2011.Capital Investment Recovery Tracker (CIRT) - In January 2009, SJG made a filing with the BPU requesting approval for an accelerated infrastructure investment program.  The purpose of the CIRT was to accelerate $103.0 million of capital expenditures from five years to two years.  The petition requested that the Company be allowed to earn a return of, and a return on, its investment.  Under the CIRT, 2009 spending was projected to be $70.5 million and 2010 spending was projected to be $32.5 million.  On a monthly basis during the CIRT year, SJG records adjustments to earnings based on actual CIRT program expenditures, as incurred.  Annually, SJG makes a filing to the BPU for review and approval of expenditures recorded under the CIRT.Regulatory actions regarding the CIRT were as follows:  • January 2009 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU for approval of an accelerated infrastructure investment program and associated rate tracker as discussed above. • April 2009 - The BPU approved SJG's petition for the CIRT, including a first year estimated capital expenditure level of $70.5 million and estimated revenue of $3.2 million. • November 2009 - SJG made its annual CIRT filing, requesting $10.6 million in additional revenue. • December 2009 - The BPU approved, on a provisional basis, recovery of an additional $9.9 million in CIRT revenue. • September 2010 - The BPU authorized $81.3 million of CIRT-related expenditures to be rolled into rate base and also authorized that the remaining balance of CIRT-related expenditures continue to be recovered.  These remaining expenditures will be reviewed and rolled into rate base during Phase II of the base rate case in 2011. • October 2010 - SJG made its annual CIRT filing, requesting approval to earn a return of, and a return on, $150.0 million in additional CIRT-related expenditures during 2011, 2012 and 2013. • March 2011 - The BPU approved a CIRT II program allowing SJG to accelerate an additional $60.3 million of capital spending into 2011 and 2012.  Under CIRT II, SJG will continue to earn a return of, and return on, investment as the capital is spent, as it did under the original CIRT. • June 2011 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU requesting the recovery of a portion of CIRT II investments via a roll-in to rate base, and requested to increase the base rates by 0.5% effective October 1, 2011.  This petition is currently pending. • October 2011 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU requesting to modify and extend the CIRT II program.  The petition requested an additional incremental investment of $40.0 million in 2012 and $50.0 million in 2013.  This petition is currently pending.  Energy Efficiency Tracker (EET) - In January 2009, SJG filed a petition with the BPU requesting approval of an energy efficiency program for residential, commercial and industrial customers.  Under this program, SJG can invest $17.0 million over two years in energy efficiency measures to be installed in customer homes and businesses. SJG can recover incremental operating and maintenance expenses and earn a return of, and return on, program investments. Regulatory actions regarding the EET were as follows: 67South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II • January 2009 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU for approval of an energy efficiency program as noted above, with a projected 2009 revenue of $1.7 million. • July 2009 - The BPU approved SJG's petition for the EET with a revenue recovery of $1.3 million. • July 2010 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU requesting a reallocation of investment dollars between the EET programs to fund the more popular programs. • November 2010 - SJG filed a petition with the BPU requesting a one year extension of the program. • January 2011 - SJG's request to reallocate investment dollars between the programs and a one year extension was approved by the BPU. • June 2011 - SJG filed its annual 2011-2012 petition requesting approval of the $5.8 million increase in EET recovery.  This petition is currently pending. • October 2011 - SJG filed a petition requesting a modification of the EET with regards to the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) program.  The BPU approved this petition in February 2012. Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) - The SBC allows SJG to recover costs related to several BPU-mandated programs. Within the SBC are a Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC), a New Jersey Clean Energy Program (NJCEP), a Universal Service Fund (USF) program and a Consumer Education Program (CEP). Regulatory actions regarding the SBC, with the exception of USF which requires separate regulatory filings, were as follows: • January 2009 - SJG made its annual 2008-2009 SBC filing requesting a $7.9 million increase in SBC recoveries. • August 2009 - SJG made its annual 2009-2010 SBC filing, requesting a $15.5 million increase in SBC recoveries. • September 2010 - SJG made its annual 2010-2011 SBC Filing, requesting a $21.5 million increase in SBC recoveries.  This petition is pending. • July 2011 - SJG made its annual 2011-2012 SBC filing requesting a $31.3 million increase in SBC recoveries.  This petition is pending. • September 2011 - The BPU finalized rates for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 SBC petitions.Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC) - The RAC recovers environmental remediation costs of 12 former gas manufacturing plants (See Note 15). The BPU allows SJG to recover such costs over seven year amortization periods. The net between the amounts actually spent and amounts recovered from customers is recorded as a regulatory asset, Environmental Remediation Cost Expended - Net. Note that RAC activity affects revenue and cash flows but does not directly affect earnings because of the cost recovery over seven year amortization periods. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, SJG reflected the unamortized remediation costs of $45.8 million and $39.1 million, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets under Regulatory Assets (See Note 11). Since implementing the RAC in 1992, SJG has recovered $58.6 million through rates as of December 31, 2011. New Jersey Clean Energy Program (NJCEP) - This mechanism recovers costs associated with SJG's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.  In August 2008, the BPU approved the statewide funding of the NJCEP of $1.2 billion for the years 2009 through 2012.  Of this amount SJG will be responsible for approximately $41.5 million over the four-year period.  NJCEP adjustments affect revenue and cash flows but do not directly affect earnings as related costs are deferred and recovered through rates on an on-going basis. Universal Service Fund (USF) - The USF is a statewide program through which funds for the USF and Lifeline Credit and Tenants Assistance Programs are collected from customers of all New Jersey electric and gas utilities. USF adjustments affect cash flows but do not directly affect revenue or earnings as related costs are deferred and recovered through rates on an on-going basis. Separate regulatory actions regarding the USF were as follows: • June 2009 - SJG made its annual USF filing, along with the state's other electric and gas utilities, proposing to decrease annual statewide gas revenues by $39.1 million.  This proposal was designed to decrease SJG's annual USF revenue by $4.9 million.68South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II • October 2009 - The BPU approved the statewide budget of $60.1 million for all of the State's gas utilities.  SJG's portion of this total is approximately $5.1 million and decreased rates were implemented effective October 12, 2009 resulting in a $4.1 million decrease to SJG's annual USF recoveries. • July 2010 - SJG made its annual USF filing, along with the state's other electric and gas utilities, proposing to increase annual statewide gas revenues by $3.4 million.  This proposal was designed to increase SJG's annual USF revenue by $0.4 million. • August 2010 - SJG updated its July 2010 filing to reflect actual data through June 2010. • October 2010 - The BPU approved the statewide budget of $64.8 million for all of the State's gas utilities.  SJG's portion of the total is approximately $6.6 million and increased rates were implemented effective November 1, 2010 resulting in a $0.4 million increase to SJG's annual USF recoveries. • June 2011 - SJG made its annual USF filing, along with the state's other electric and gas utilities, proposing to decrease annual statewide gas revenues by $9.3 million.  This proposal was designed to decrease SJG's annual USF revenue by $0.8 million. • October 2011 - The BPU approved the statewide budget of $57.4 million for all of the State's gas utilities.  SJG's portion of the total is approximately $5.4 million, which decreased rates effective November 1, 2011, resulting in a $0.5 million decrease to SJG's annual USF recoveries. Other Regulatory Matters - Unbundling - Effective January 10, 2000, the BPU approved full unbundling of SJG's system. This allows all natural gas consumers to select their natural gas commodity supplier. As of December 31, 2011, 35,880 of SJG's residential customers were purchasing their gas commodity from someone other than SJG. Customers choosing to purchase natural gas from providers other than the utility are charged for the cost of gas by the marketer. The resulting decrease in utility revenues is offset by a corresponding decrease in gas costs. While customer choice can reduce utility revenues, it does not negatively affect SJG's net income or financial condition. The BPU continues to allow for full recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs through the BGSS. Unbundling did not change the fact that SJG still recovers cost of service, including certain deferred costs, through base rates. Pipeline Integrity - In October 2005, SJG filed a petition with the BPU to implement a Pipeline Integrity Management Tracker (Tracker). The purpose of this Tracker was to recover incremental costs to be incurred by SJG as a result of new federal regulations, which are aimed at enhancing public safety and reliability. The regulations require that utilities use a comprehensive analysis to assess, evaluate, repair and validate the integrity of certain transmission lines in the event of a leak or failure. As part of SJG's September 2010 base rate increase, SJG was permitted to recover previously deferred pipeline integrity costs incurred through September 2010.  In addition, SJG is authorized to defer future program costs, and related carrying costs, for recovery in the next base rate proceeding, subject to review by the BPU.  Accordingly, SJG withdrew its petition for the Pipeline Integrity Management Tracker.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, deferred pipeline integrity costs totaled $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and are included in other regulatory assets. Filings and petitions described above are still pending unless otherwise indicated.11.REGULATORY ASSETS & REGULATORY LIABILITIES:The discussion under Note 10, Rates and Regulatory Actions, is integral to the following explanations of specific regulatory assets and liabilities.Regulatory Assets consisted of the following items (in thousands):69South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010Environmental Remediation Costs:   Expended - Net$45,815 $39,056Liability for Future Expenditures89,984 87,393Income Taxes - Flowthrough Depreciation— 774Deferred Asset Retirement Obligation Costs25,162 24,247Deferred Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs88,624 69,017Deferred Gas Costs - Net22,441 —Conservation Incentive Program Receivable13,580 12,291Societal Benefit Costs Receivable8,618 4,216Premium for Early Retirement of Debt537 699Deferred Interest Rate Contracts8,146 3,150Other Regulatory Assets12,314 7,570    Total Regulatory Assets$315,221 $248,413Except where noted below, all regulatory assets are or will be recovered through utility rate charges as detailed in the following discussion. SJG is currently permitted to recover interest on Environmental Remediation Costs and Societal Benefit Costs Receivable while the other assets are being recovered without a return on investment. Environmental Remediation Costs - SJG has two regulatory assets associated with environmental costs related to the cleanup of 12 sites where SJG or their predecessors previously operated gas manufacturing plants. The first asset, Environmental Remediation Cost: Expended - Net, represents what was actually spent to clean up the sites, less recoveries through the RAC and insurance carriers. These costs meet the deferral requirements of GAAP as the BPU allows SJG to recover such expenditures through the RAC. The other asset, Environmental Remediation Cost: Liability for Future Expenditures, relates to estimated future expenditures required to complete the remediation of these sites.  SJG recorded this estimated amount as a regulatory asset with the corresponding current and noncurrent liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets under the captions Current Liabilities and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities. The BPU allows SJG to recover the deferred costs over seven-year periods after they are spent. Income Taxes - Flowthrough Depreciation - This regulatory asset was created upon the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” in 1993. The amount represents unamortized excess tax depreciation over book depreciation on utility plant because of temporary differences for which, prior to adoption, deferred taxes previously were not provided. SJG previously passed these tax benefits through to ratepayers and recovered the amortization of the regulatory asset through rates until 2011. Deferred Asset Retirement Obligation Costs - This regulatory asset was created with the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 440 “Commitments” in 2005. This resulted in the recording of ARO and additional utility plant, primarily related to a legal obligation SJG has for certain safety requirements upon the retirement of its gas distribution and transmission system. SJG recovers asset retirement costs through rates charged to customers. All related accumulated accretion and depreciation amounts for these ARO represent timing differences in the recognition of retirement costs that SJG is currently recovering in rates and, as such, SJG is deferring such differences as regulatory assets. Deferred Gas Costs and Deferred Revenues - Net - Over/under collections of gas costs are monitored through SJG’s BGSS clause.  Net undercollected gas costs are classified as a regulatory asset and net overcollected gas costs are classified as a regulatory liability.  Derivative contracts used to hedge SJG's natural gas purchases are also included in the BGSS, subject to BPU approval.  The change in the BGSS from a $20.2 million regulatory liability at December 31, 2010 to a $22.4 million regulatory asset at December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the BGSS refund to customers discussed above in Note 10.70South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIDeferred Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs - The BPU authorized SJG to recover costs related to postretirement benefits under the accrual method of accounting consistent with GAAP.  SJG deferred amounts accrued prior to that authorization and are amortizing them as allowed by the BPU over 15 years through 2012. The unamortized balance was $0.4 million at December 31, 2011. Upon the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation - Retirement Benefits” in 2006, SJG's regulatory asset was increased by $37.1 million representing the recognition of underfunded positions of SJG's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Subsequent adjustments to this balance occur annually to reflect changes in the funded positions of these benefit plans caused by changes in actual plan experience as well as assumptions of future experience (See Note 12). Conservation Incentive Program Receivable - The impact of the CIP is recorded as an adjustment to earnings as incurred. The first year of cash recovery under the CIP began October 2007. Societal Benefit Costs Receivable - At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, this regulatory asset primarily represents cumulative costs less recoveries under the USF program. Premium for Early Retirement of Debt - At December 31, 2011, this regulatory asset represents unamortized debt issuance costs related to long-term debt refinancings and a call premium of $0.2 million associated with the retirement of debt, all occurring in 2005 and 2004. Unamortized debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the new debt issue pursuant to regulatory approval by the BPU. As part of our September 2010 base rate increase, the call premium was transferred to unamortized debt issuance costs and is being amortized over the term of the new debt issue.Deferred Interest Rate Contracts - These amounts represent the market value of interest rate derivatives as discussed further in Note 16. Other Regulatory Assets - Some of the assets included in Other Regulatory Assets are currently being recovered from ratepayers as approved by the BPU. Management believes the remaining deferred costs are probable of recovery from ratepayers through future utility rates.Regulatory Liabilities consisted of the following items (in thousands): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010Excess Plant Removal Costs$47,230 $48,409Deferred Revenues - Net— 20,179Other Regulatory Liabilities1,081 660    Total Regulatory Liabilities$48,311 $69,248Excess Plant Removal Costs - Represents amounts accrued in excess of actual utility plant removal costs incurred to date.  As part of our September 2010 base rate increase, we are required to start amortizing approximately $1.2 million of this balance to depreciation expense each year. Deferred Revenues - Net - See previous discussion under “Deferred Gas Costs - Net.” Other Regulatory Liabilities - All other regulatory liabilities are subject to being returned to ratepayers in future rate proceedings.71South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II12.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:SJI has several defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The pension plans provide annuity payments to the majority of full-time, regular employees upon retirement. Participation in the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans was closed to new employees beginning in 2003; however, employees who are not eligible for these pension plans are eligible to receive an enhanced version of SJI's defined contribution plan. Certain SJI officers also participate in a non-funded supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The other postretirement benefit plans provide health care and life insurance benefits to some retirees.Net periodic benefit cost related to the employee and officer pension and other postretirement benefit plans consisted of the following components (in thousands):  Pension Benefits 2011 2010 2009Service Cost$3,918 $3,426 $3,225Interest Cost9,524 9,197 8,694Expected Return on Plan Assets(9,367) (8,402) (7,553)Amortizations:     Prior Service Cost267 280 278Actuarial Loss5,440 4,751 5,405Net Periodic Benefit Cost9,782 9,252 10,049ERIP Costs102 — —Capitalized Benefit Costs(3,661) (3,445) (3,798)Total Net Periodic Benefit Expense$6,223 $5,807 $6,251 Other Postretirement Benefits 2011 2010 2009Service Cost$996 $920 $893Interest Cost3,201 3,267 3,208Expected Return on Plan Assets(2,248) (1,937) (1,551)Amortizations:     Prior Service Credits(355) (355) (355)Actuarial Loss1,654 1,495 1,896Net Periodic Benefit Cost3,248 3,390 4,091Capitalized Benefit Costs(1,222) (1,295) (1,676)Total Net Periodic Benefit Expense$2,026 $2,095 $2,415Capitalized benefit costs reflected in the table above relate to SJG’s construction program.The ERIP costs reflected in the table above relate to an early retirement plan offered during 2011 to one of our business segments.Companies with publicly traded equity securities that sponsor a postretirement benefit plan are required to fully recognize, as an asset or liability, the overfunded or underfunded status of its benefit plans and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. Changes in funded status are generally reported in Other Comprehensive Loss; however, since SJG recovers all prudently incurred pension and postretirement benefit costs from its ratepayers, a significant portion of the charges resulting from the recording of additional liabilities under this statement are reported as regulatory assets (See Note 11). Details of the activity within the Regulatory Asset and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss associated with Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits are as follows (in thousands): 72South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II Regulatory Assets Accumulated OtherComprehensive Loss (pre-tax) Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits Pension Benefits Other Postretirement BenefitsBalance at January 1, 2010$48,064 $21,994 $19,034 $2,398    Amounts Arising during the Period:      Net Actuarial Loss2,300 167 6,569 818Amounts Amortized to Net Periodic Costs:      Net Actuarial Loss(2,935) (1,351) (1,793) (144)   Prior Service (Cost) Credit(232) 254 (47) 94        Balance at December 31, 201047,197 21,064 23,763 3,166        Amounts Arising during the Period:      Net Actuarial (Gain) Loss17,861 6,060 10,436 1,567   Prior Service (Cost) Credit— 524 — 104Amounts Amortized to Net Periodic Costs:      Net Actuarial Loss(3,028) (1,467) (2,386) (186)   Prior Service (Cost) Credit(219) 254 (47) 94        Balance at December 31, 2011$61,811 $26,435 $31,766 $4,745 The estimated costs that will be amortized from Regulatory Assets into net periodic benefit costs in 2012 are as follows (in thousands):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement BenefitsPrior Service Costs (Credits)$203 $(195)Net Actuarial Loss$4,369 $1,690The estimated costs that will be amortized from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into net periodic benefit costs in 2012 are as follows (in thousands): Pension Benefits Other Postretirement  BenefitsPrior Service Costs (Credits)$47 $(89)Net Actuarial Loss$3,241 $314 A reconciliation of the plans' benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in SJI's consolidated balance sheets follows (in thousands): 73South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits   2011 2010 2011 2010Change in Benefit Obligations:   Benefit Obligation at Beginning of Year$167,500 $149,008 $58,465 $56,138   Service Cost3,918 3,426 996 920   Interest Cost9,524 $9,197 3,201 3,267   Actuarial Loss22,162 13,777 5,018 2,567   Retiree Contributions— — 370 185   Plan Amendments102 — 631 —   Benefits Paid(8,216) (7,908) (4,230) (4,612)Benefit Obligation at End of Year$194,990 $167,500 $64,451 $58,465        Change in Plan Assets:   Fair Value of Plan Assets at Beginning of Year$120,600 $105,898 $32,119 $28,489   Actual Return on Plan Assets3,114 13,380 (373) 3,630   Employer Contributions1,220 9,230 4,010 4,427   Retiree Contributions— — 370 185   Benefits Paid(8,216) (7,908) (4,230) (4,612)Fair Value of Plan Assets at End of Year$116,718 $120,600 $31,896 $32,119                Funded Status at End of Year:$(78,272) $(46,900) $(32,555) $(26,346)Amounts Related to Unconsolidated Affiliate245 105 286 249Accrued Net Benefit Cost at End of Year$(78,027) $(46,795) $(32,269) $(26,097)        Amounts Recognized in the Statement of Financial Position Consist of:      Current Liabilities$(1,275) $(1,217) $— $—   Noncurrent Liabilities(76,752) (45,578) (32,269) (26,097)Net Amount Recognized at End of Year$(78,027) $(46,795) $(32,269) $(26,097)        Amounts Recognized in Regulatory Assets Consist of:      Prior Service Costs (Credit)$1,049 $1,268 $563 $(215)   Net Actuarial Loss60,762 45,929 25,872 21,279 $61,811 $47,197 $26,435 $21,064        Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Consist of (pre-tax):      Prior Service Costs (Credit)$153 $200 $(14) $(212)   Net Actuarial Loss31,613 23,563 4,759 3,378 $31,766 $23,763 $4,745 $3,166 The projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of SJI's qualified employee pension plans were $163.1 million and $147.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011, and $142.4 million and $128.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.  The ABO of these plans exceeded the value of the plan assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.  The value of these assets can be seen in the table above.

SJG also has a regulatory obligation to contribute approximately $3.6 million annually to its other postretirement benefit plans’ trusts, less costs incurred directly by SJG.  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN - SJI offers an Employees' Retirement Savings Plan (Savings Plan) to eligible employees.  For employees eligible for participation in SJI's defined benefit pension plan, SJI matches 50%  of participants' contributions up to 6% of base compensation. For employees who are not eligible for participation in SJI's defined benefit pension plans, SJI matches 50% of participants' contributions up to 8% of base compensation. Employees not eligible for the pension plans also receive a year-end contribution of $1,000, if 10 or fewer years of service, or $1,500, if more than 10 years of service. The amount expensed and contributed for the matching provision of the Savings Plan approximated $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.79South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II13.UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT: Credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands):CompanyTotal FacilityUsageAvailable LiquidityExpiration DateSJG:    Commercial Paper Program/Revolving Credit Facility$200,000$126,600$73,400May 2015Uncommitted Bank Lines20,000—20,000VariousTotal SJG220,000126,60093,400 SJI:    Revolving Credit Facility300,000247,80852,192April 2015 (A)Term Line of Credit30,00030,000—November 2013Total SJI330,000277,80852,192 Total$550,000$404,408$145,592 (A) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $83.0 million.The SJG facilities are restricted as to use and availability specifically to SJG; however, if necessary, the SJI facilities can also be used to support SJG’s liquidity needs. Borrowings under these credit facilities are at market rates. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings, which changes daily, was 1.12%,  0.99% and 0.77% at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $156.9 million and $110.1 million, respectively. The maximum amounts outstanding under these credit facilities during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $337.5 million and $317.5 million, respectively.New revolving credit facilities were established by SJI and SJG in April 2011 and May 2011, respectively. The SJI facility is a $300.0 million four-year facility provided by a syndicate of banks. The SJG facility is a $200.0 million, four-year facility, provided by the same syndicate of banks. Each facility contains one financial covenant limiting the ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in the respective credit agreements) to not more than 0.65 to 1, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. SJI and SJG were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2011. These facilities replaced SJI’s $200.0 million revolving credit facility and SJG’s $100.0 million revolving credit facility and $40.0 million committed line of credit, all of which would otherwise have expired in August of 2011. The letters of credit that provide liquidity support for the variable-rate revenue bonds issued by Marina are now issued under SJI’s new revolving credit facility that expires in 2015. Consequently, these bonds, which were included in the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2010, are now included in long-term debt as of December 31, 2011.During the third quarter of  2011, SJG began a commercial paper program under which SJG may issue short-term, unsecured promissory notes to qualified investors up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $200.0 million.  The notes  have fixed maturities which vary by note, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Proceeds from the notes are used for general corporate purposes.  SJG uses the commercial paper program in tandem with the new $200.0 million revolving credit facility and does not expect the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the credit facility at any time to exceed an aggregate of $200.0 million.80South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II14.LONG-TERM DEBT:Outstanding Long-Term Debt at December 31 consisted of the following:   2011 2010Long-Term Debt (A):         South Jersey Gas Company:             First Mortgage Bonds: (B)           6.74%Series due 2011 (C) $— $10,0006.57%Series due 2011 (C) — 15,0004.46%Series due 2013 10,500 10,5005.027%Series due 2013 14,500 14,5004.52%Series due 2014 11,000 11,0005.115%Series due 2014 10,000 10,0005.387%Series due 2015 10,000 10,0005.437%Series due 2016 10,000 10,0004.6%Series due 2016 17,000 17,0004.657%Series due 2017 15,000 15,0007.97%Series due 2018 10,000 10,0007.125%Series due 2018 20,000 20,0005.587%Series due 2019 10,000 10,0003.63%Series due 2025 10,000 10,0004.84%Series due 2026 15,000 15,0004.93%Series due 2026 45,000 45,0004.03%Series due 2027 45,000 45,0007.7%Series due 2027 (F) 35,000 35,0005.55%Series due 2033 32,000 32,0006.213%Series due 2034 10,000 10,0005.45%Series due 2035 10,000 10,000              Series A 2006 Bonds at variable rates due 2036 (D) 25,000 25,000          Marina Energy LLC:  (E)             Series A 2001 Bonds at variable rates due 2031 20,000 20,000        Series B 2001 Bonds at variable rates due 2021 25,000 25,000        Series A 2006 Bonds at variable rates due 2036 16,400 16,400     Total Long-Term Debt Outstanding 426,400 451,400Less Current Maturities (2,187) (111,400)      Total Long-Term Debt $424,213 $340,000(A)Long-term debt maturities and sinking funds requirements for the succeeding five years are as follows (in thousands):  2012, $2,187; 2013, $27,188; 2014, $23,187; 2015, $13,096, 2016, $30,097.(B)The First Mortgage dated October 1, 1947, as supplemented, securing the First Mortgage Bonds constitutes a direct first mortgage lien on substantially all utility plant. (C)In 2011, SJG retired its 6.74% and 6.57% Medium Term Notes, at par.81South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II(D)These variable rate demand bonds bear interest at a floating rate that resets weekly.

(F)See Note 18 - Subsequent Events.During 2010, SJG issued $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Medium Term Notes in private placements due 2025, 2026 and 2027 and retired its $10.0 million, 6.12%  Medium Term Notes at par.  In 2011, SJG entered into an arrangement to issue Medium Term Notes under a private placement in an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million.  SJG expects to issue this debt in April 2012.  Also in 2011, SJG repaid $25.0 million of First Mortgage Bonds. As of  September 30, 2011 the $150.0 million Medium Term Note program that was approved by the BPU in September 2009 expired. In December 2011, SJG received approval from the BPU to issue up to $200.0 million in long-term debt under its MTN program by September 30, 2014.The estimated fair values of SJI’s long-term debt, including current maturities, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $533.4 million and $517.0 million, respectively.  The carrying amounts of SJI’s long-term debt, including current maturities, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $426.4 million and $451.4 million, respectively.  We based the estimates on interest rates available to SJI at the end of each year for debt with similar terms and maturities.15.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:GAS SUPPLY CONTRACTS - In the normal course of business, SJG and SJRG have entered into long-term contracts for natural gas supplies, firm transportation and gas storage service. The transportation and storage service agreements with interstate pipeline suppliers were made under FERC approved tariffs.  SJRG's cumulative obligation for demand charges and reservation fees paid to suppliers for these services is approximately $1.4 million per month. SJG's cumulative obligation for demand charges and reservation fees paid to suppliers for these services averages approximately $3.7 million per month and is recovered on a current basis through the BGSS.  SJRG has also committed to purchase a minimum of 340,000 dts/d and up to 700,000 dts/d of natural gas, from various suppliers, for terms ranging from three to ten years at index based prices.PENDING LITIGATION - The Company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business and other legal proceedings. The Company has been named in, among other actions, certain product liability claims related to our former sand mining subsidiary. We accrue liabilities related to these claims when we can reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of probable settlement costs or other charges for these claims. The Company has accrued approximately $2.9 million and $4.2 million related to all claims in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a material change in the Company's estimated liability in the near term and does not currently anticipate the disposition of any known claims that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS — Unionized personnel represent approximately 48.0% of our workforce at December 31, 2011. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with two unions that represent these employees: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1293 and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Local 76.  SJG and SJESP employees represented by the IBEW operate under a collective bargaining agreement that runs through February 2013, with the option to extend until February 2014 at the union’s election. The remaining unionized employees represented by the IAM operate under a collective bargaining agreement that expires in August 2014.82South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIGUARANTEES - As of December 31, 2011, SJI, the parent company, has issued guarantees to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries.  These guarantees were issued to guarantee payment to third parties with whom SJI's consolidated subsidiaries have commodity supply contracts and for Marina's construction and operating activities. As of December 31, 2011, these guarantees support future firm commitments of SJI's consolidated subsidiaries and $74.8 million of the Accounts Payable already recorded on SJI's consolidated balance sheet.The Company has recorded a liability of $1.9 million which is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities with a corresponding increase in Investment in Affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 for the fair value of the following guarantees:In April 2007, SJI guaranteed certain obligations of LVE Energy Partners, LLC (LVE) an unconsolidated joint venture in which Marina has a 50% equity interest.  LVE entered into a 25-year contract with a resort developer to design, build, own and operate a district energy system and central energy center for a planned resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.  LVE began construction of the facility in 2007 and expected to provide full energy service in 2010 when the resort was originally scheduled to be completed.  LVE suspended construction of the district energy system and central energy center in January 2009 after the resort developer’s August 2008 announcement that it was delaying the completion of construction of the resort due to the difficult environment in the capital markets and weak economic conditions.  The resort developer had indicated that it was considering different strategies to move its project forward, including opening its project in phases and obtaining a partner, but that it was unlikely construction would resume during 2009.  In November 2011, the resort developer, repeating previous disclosures, indicated again that it does not expect to resume construction on the project for three to five years.  The resort developer stated that it remains committed to having a significant presence on the Las Vegas Strip as part of a long-term growth strategy and continues to view this site as a major strategic asset.The district energy system and central energy center are being financed by LVE with debt that is non-recourse to SJI. The outstanding balance of LVE’s bank debt is approximately $193.0 million as of December 31, 2011.  As a result of the construction delay, the district energy system and central energy center were not completed by the end of 2010 as originally expected. Consequently, the full amount of LVE’s debt became due and payable in December 2010. LVE intends to seek additional financing to complete the facility once construction of the resort resumes, however, as of December 31, 2010, LVE was in default under the financing agreements with the banks.  The Energy Sales Agreement between LVE and the resort developer includes a payment obligation by the resort developer to pay certain fees and expenses to LVE. A portion of this payment obligation is guaranteed to LVE’s lenders by the parent of the resort developer.In March 2011, LVE reached agreements with (a) the resort developer, that specified the payments to be made by the developer to LVE during the suspension period and provided the developer and its corporate parent with an option to purchase the assets of LVE, and (b) the banks that are financing the energy facilities to address the existing default under the financing agreements. The terms of the March 2011 agreement require the resort developer to pay certain fees and expenses to LVE on a monthly basis beginning in March 2011 until construction of the resort resumes or until the resort developer has exercised its option to purchase the energy facilities from LVE. The monthly payments that are being paid to LVE by the resort developer are expected to be sufficient to reimburse LVE for costs to maintain the energy facilities and to cover debt service costs over time. The resort developer has provided LVE with a $6.0 million letter of credit to support its monthly payment obligation.The banks that are financing the energy facilities have agreed not to exercise their rights under the financing agreements resulting from the event of default discussed above through December 2013, provided that no additional events of default occur. SJI and its joint venture partner have provided a total of $10.0 million in letters of credit to the banks to support LVE’s obligations, which can be drawn upon by the banks at the end of the existing agreement in December 2013 or upon the occurrence of an event of default by LVE prior to December 2013.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a net liability of approximately $1.6 million included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets related to this project, in addition to unsecured Notes Receivable – Affiliate of approximately $57.5 million due from LVE. As of December 31, 2011, SJI’s capital at risk is limited to its equity contributions, letters of credit and the unsecured notes receivable totaling approximately $70.9 million. During 2011, SJI provided support to LVE of approximately $6.1 million to cover interest and other project related costs.As a result of the construction delay, management has evaluated the investment in LVE and concluded that the fair value of this investment continues to be in excess of the carrying value as of December 31, 2011.83South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI has guaranteed certain performance obligations of LVE under the operating agreements between LVE and the resort developer, up to $20.0 million each year for the term of the agreement, commencing with the first year of operations.  SJI and its partner in this joint venture have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI on this guarantee.SJI has guaranteed certain obligations of BC Landfill Energy, LLC (BCLE) and WC Landfill Energy, LLC (WCLE), unconsolidated joint ventures in which Marina has a 50% equity interest through Energenic. BCLE and WCLE have entered into agreements ranging from 15-20 years with the respective county governments to lease and operate facilities that will produce electricity from landfill methane gas.  Although unlikely, the maximum amount that SJI could be obligated for, in the event that BCLE and WCLE do not meet minimum specified levels of operating performance and no mitigating action is taken, or are unable to meet certain financial obligations as they become due, is approximately $4.2 million each year.  SJI and its partner in these joint ventures have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI on these guarantees.  SJI holds variable interests in BCLE and WCLE but is not the primary beneficiary.As of December 31, 2011, SJI had issued $4.9 million of parental guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated subsidiary. These guarantees generally expire within the next two years and were issued to enable our subsidiary to market retail natural gas.CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION -  In February 2011, ACR Energy Partners, LLC (ACR), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energenic, of which Marina has a 50% equity interest, entered into a 20 year contract with a developer to build, own and operate a central energy center and energy distribution system for a planned hotel, casino and entertainment complex in Atlantic City, New Jersey. ACR is currently providing construction energy to the complex and will provide full energy services when the complex is completed in 2012. The contract calls for Marina and its joint venture partner to make capital contributions to ACR that will enable ACR to a) repay $42.0 million of construction advances made by the developer and b) deposit $2.8 million in a debt service reserve fund, provided, in each case, that the developer has met certain conditions. These conditions include, among others, substantial completion of the complex and demonstration of adequate financial resources to operate the complex (See Note 18 - Subsequent Events). Marina and its joint venture partner have also agreed to provide a $5.0 million letter of credit in 2012 to support certain operating performance obligations of ACR under the operating agreements between ACR and the developer, provided the developer has met the conditions just outlined. SJI and its partner in this joint venture have entered into reimbursement agreements that secure reimbursement for SJI of a proportionate share of any payments made by SJI to or on behalf of ACR.STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT — As of December 31, 2011, SJI provided $83.0 million of standby letters of credit through SJI’s revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the amount of $62.3 million support variable-rate demand bonds issued through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) to finance Marina’s initial thermal plant project and $20.7 million were posted to enable SJE to market retail electricity and for various construction activities. The Company also provided an additional $25.2 million letter of credit under a separate facility outside of the revolving credit facility to support variable-rate demand bonds issued through the NJEDA to finance the expansion of SJG’s natural gas distribution system.  As of December 31, 2010, the variable-rate demand bonds issued by Marina and SJG were included in the current portion of long-term debt because the letters of credit expired during 2011.  The replacement letters of credit expire in August 2015, and as a result, the related bonds are now included in long-term debt as of December 31, 2011.ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS — SJI incurred and recorded costs for environmental cleanup of 12 sites where SJG or its predecessors operated gas manufacturing plants. SJG stopped manufacturing gas in the 1950s. SJI and some of its nonutility subsidiaries also recorded costs for environmental cleanup of sites where SJF previously operated a fuel oil business and Morie maintained equipment, fueling stations and storage. SJI successfully entered into settlements with all of its historic comprehensive general liability carriers regarding the environmental remediation expenditures at the SJG sites. Also, SJG purchased a Cleanup Cost Cap Insurance Policy limiting the amount of remediation expenditures that SJG will be required to make at 11 of its sites. This policy will be in force until 2024 at 10 sites and until 2029 at 1 site. The future cost estimates discussed hereafter are not reduced by projected insurance recoveries from the Cleanup Cost Cap Insurance Policy. The policy is limited to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million, of which SJG has recovered $47.2 million through December 31, 2011.  As discussed in Note 10, the BPU allows SJG to recover environmental remediation costs through the RAC.Since the early 1980s, SJI accrued environmental remediation costs of $289.5 million, of which $195.4 million was spent as of December 31, 2011.84South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThe following table details the amounts expended and accrued for SJI's environmental remediation during the last two years (in thousands): 2011 2010Beginning of Year$91,833 $73,442   Accruals21,934 27,371   Expenditures(19,607) (8,980)End of Year$94,160 $91,833The balances are segregated between current and noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets under the captions Current Liabilities and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities.Management estimates that undiscounted future costs to clean up SJG's sites will range from $90.0 million to $217.2 million. Six of SJG's sites comprise the majority of these estimates, ranging from a low of $70.8 million to a high of $171.0 million. SJG recorded the lower end of this range as a liability because a single reliable estimation point is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty involved in the nature of projected remediation efforts and the long period over which remediation efforts will continue. Recorded amounts include estimated costs based on projected investigation and remediation work plans using existing technologies. Actual costs could differ from the estimates due to the long-term nature of the projects, changing technology, government regulations and site-specific requirements. Significant risks surrounding these estimates include unforeseen market price increases for remedial services, property owner acceptance of remedy selection, regulatory approval of selected remedy and remedial investigative findings. The remediation efforts at SJG's six most significant sites include the following:Site 1 - Remediation of the site is currently underway in accordance with the remedial action work plan approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Remaining steps to complete the remedy include continued excavation of impacted soil and groundwater monitoring and sampling.Site 2 - Various remedial investigation and action activities are ongoing at this site.  An interim remedial measure has been implemented and a remedial action work plan has been prepared and submitted to the NJDEP for an offsite interim remedial measure.   Remaining steps to remediate soil and groundwater include completing the remedial investigation of impacted soil and groundwater in preparation for selecting the appropriate action and implementation and gaining regulatory and property owner approval of the selected remedy.Site 3 - Various remedial investigation and action activities are ongoing at this site. Remaining steps include completion of an interim remedial action at one off site property and final remedy selection for the remaining impacts at the site, regulatory approval of the final remedy, and implementation of the selected remedy to address remaining impacted soil and groundwater.Site 4 - Remedial investigation activities are ongoing at this site including pilot studies of potential remedial alternatives and continued soil and groundwater investigation. Remaining steps to remediate the site include completing the investigation of impacted soil and groundwater in preparation for selecting the appropriate action, gaining regulatory and property owner approval of the selected remedy and implementation of the remedy once approved.Site 5 - Remedial investigation activities are ongoing at this site. Remaining steps include completing the remedial investigation of impacted soil and groundwater in preparation for selecting the appropriate action and implementation and gaining regulatory and property owner approval of the selected remedy.Site 6 - Remedial investigation activities are ongoing at this site. Remaining steps to remediate include completing the remedial investigation of impacted soil and groundwater in preparation for selecting the appropriate action and implementation and gaining regulatory approval of the selected remedy.With Morie's sale, EMI assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities currently estimated between $2.5 million and $7.3 million. The information available on these sites is sufficient only to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other. Therefore, EMI has accrued the lower end of the range. Changes in the accrual are included in the statements of consolidated income under Loss from Discontinued Operations.85South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IISJI and SJF estimate their potential exposure for the future remediation of six sites where fuel oil operations existed years ago to range from $1.6 million to $3.6 million. The lower end of this range has been recorded under Current Liabilities and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities as of December 31, 2011.16.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:Certain SJI subsidiaries are involved in buying, selling, transporting and storing natural gas and buying and selling retail electricity for their own accounts as well as managing these activities for third parties. These subsidiaries are subject to market risk on expected future purchases and sales due to commodity price fluctuations. The Company uses a variety of derivative instruments to limit this exposure to market risk in accordance with strict corporate guidelines.  These derivative instruments include forward contracts, swap agreements, options contracts and futures contracts. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding derivative contracts intended to limit the exposure to market risk on 20.7 MMdts of expected future purchases of natural gas, 19.0 MMdts of expected future sales of natural gas, 1.0 MMmwh of expected future purchases of electricity and 0.4 MMmwh of expected future sales of electricity.  These contracts, which have not been designated as hedging instruments under GAAP, are measured at fair value and recorded in Derivatives — Energy Related Assets or Derivatives — Energy Related Liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The net unrealized pre-tax gains and losses for these energy related commodity contracts are included with realized gains and losses in Operating Revenues – Nonutility.SJI structured its subsidiaries so that SJG and SJE transact commodities on a physical basis and typically do not directly enter into positions that financially settle. SJRG performs this risk management function for these entities and enters into the types of financial transactions noted above. As part of its gas purchasing strategy, SJG uses financial contracts through SJRG to hedge against forward price risk. The costs or benefits of these short-term contracts are recoverable through SJG's BGSS clause, subject to BPU approval. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, SJG had $10.2 million and $5.0 million of costs, respectively, included in its BGSS related to open financial contracts.Management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in identifying, assessing and controlling various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies to limit exposure to market risk.SJI presents revenues and expenses related to its energy trading activities on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility in the consolidated statements of income consistent with GAAP. This net presentation has no effect on operating income or net income.The Company has also entered into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to increasing interest rates and the impact of those rates on cash flows of variable-rate debt. These interest rate derivatives, some of which have been designated as hedging instruments under GAAP, are measured at fair value and recorded in Derivatives-Other on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value represents the amount SJI would have to pay the counterparty to terminate these contracts as of those dates.   As of December 31, 2011, SJI's active interest rate swaps were as follows:Notional Amount Fixed Interest Rate Start Date Maturity Type of Debt Obligor$3,900,000 4.795% 12/1/2004 12/1/2014 Taxable Marina$8,000,000 4.775% 11/12/2004 11/12/2014 Taxable Marina$14,500,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$500,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$330,000 3.905% 3/17/2006 1/15/2026 Tax-exempt Marina$7,100,000 4.895% 2/1/2006 2/1/2016 Taxable Marina$12,500,000 3.430% 12/1/2006 2/1/2036 Tax-exempt SJG$12,500,000 3.430% 12/1/2006 2/1/2036 Tax-exempt SJGThe interest rate derivatives that are currently designated as cash flow hedges have been determined to be highly effective.  Therefore, the changes in fair value of the effective portion of these swaps along with the cumulative unamortized costs, net of taxes, have been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. These unrealized gains and losses will be reclassified into earnings when the forecasted cash flows of the related variable-rate debt affects earnings, or when it is probable that it will not occur. The ineffective portion of these swaps have been included in Interest Charges.86South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThe unrealized gains and losses on the interest rate derivatives that have not been designated as cash flow hedges have also been included in Interest Charges. However, for selected interest rate derivatives at SJG, management believes that, subject to BPU approval, the market value upon termination can be recovered in rates and therefore these unrealized losses have been included in Other Regulatory Assets in the consolidated balance sheets.The fair values of all derivative instruments, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, are as follows (in thousands):Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP 2011 2010  Assets Liabilities Assets LiabilitiesEnergy related commodity contracts:        Derivatives – Energy Related – Current $37,461 $38,738 $39,513 $42,297Derivatives – Energy Related – Non-Current 8,135 7,367 11,556 8,641Interest rate contracts:        Derivatives - Other  10,684 — 5,539Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP 45,596 56,789 51,069 56,477         Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP                 Interest rate contracts:        Derivatives - Other  3,362 — 1,865Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP — 3,362 — 1,865         Total Derivatives $45,596 $60,151 $51,069 $58,342The effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31  is as follows (in thousands):Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 2011 2010 2009Interest Rate Contracts:      (Losses) gains recognized in OCI on effective portion $(2,773) $(1,063) $164(Losses) gains reclassified from accumulated OCI into income (a) $(1,435) $(1,486) $(1,462)Losses recognized in income on ineffective portion (a) — — —(a) Included in Interest ChargesDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments under GAAP 2011 2010 2009Gains (losses) on energy related commodity contracts (a) $5,377 $(22,624) $(14,815)(Losses) gains on interest rate contracts (b) (149) (641) 1,210       Total $5,228 $(23,265) $(13,605)(a)  Included in Operating Revenues - Non Utility(b)  Included in Interest Charges87South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part II    Net realized losses associated with SJG’s energy related financial commodity contracts of $12.9 million, $23.5 million and $51.9 million for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are not included in the above table. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, SJG had $10.2 million and $5.0 million of unrealized losses on energy related financial commodity contracts, respectively, included in its BGSS which are also not included in the above table.  These contracts are part of SJG’s regulated risk management activities that serve to mitigate BGSS costs passed on to its customers. As these transactions are entered into pursuant to, and recoverable through, regulatory riders, any changes in the value of SJG’s energy related financial commodity contracts are deferred in Regulatory Assets or Liabilities and there is no impact to earnings.Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments contain provisions that require immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions in the event of a material adverse change in the credit standing of the Company. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position on December 31, 2011, is $16.9 million.   If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered on December 31, 2011, the Company would have been required to settle the instruments immediately or post collateral to its counterparties of approximately $14.5 million after offsetting asset positions with the same counterparties under master netting arrangements.17.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES:GAAP establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques.  The levels of the hierarchy are described below:•Level 1:  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.•Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.Assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.For financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, information about the fair value measurements for each major category is as follows (in thousands):As of December 31, 2011Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Assets       Available-for-Sale Securities (A)$6,677 $619 $6,058 $—Derivatives – Energy Related Assets (B)45,596 24,689 16,582 4,325 $52,273 $25,308 $22,640 $4,325        Liabilities               Derivatives – Energy Related Liabilities (B)$46,105 $22,495 $13,327 $10,283Derivatives – Other (C)14,046 — 14,046 — $60,151 $22,495 $27,373 $10,28388South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIAs of December 31, 2010Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Assets       Available-for-Sale Securities (A)$6,720 $6,720 $— $—Derivatives – Energy Related Assets (B)51,069 21,204 24,878 4,987 $57,789 $27,924 $24,878 $4,987         Liabilities               Derivatives – Energy Related Liabilities (B)$50,938 $19,513 $23,275 $8,150Derivatives – Other (C)7,404 — 7,404 — $58,342 $19,513 $30,679 $8,150(A) Available-for-Sale Securities include securities that are traded in active markets and securities that are not traded publicly.  The securities traded in active markets are valued using the quoted principal market close prices that are provided by the trustees and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  The remaining securities consist of funds that are not publicly traded.  These funds, which consist of stocks and bonds that are traded individually in active markets, are valued using quoted prices for similar assets and are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.(B) Derivatives – Energy Related Assets and Liabilities are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted market sources in active markets and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain non-exchange-based contracts are valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that management believes provide the most liquid market. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, management considers the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations to ensure the prices are observable which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration.(C) Derivatives – Other include interest rate swaps that are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.Transfers between different levels of the fair value hierarchy may occur based on the level of observable inputs used to value the instruments from period to period.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, including no transfers in or out of Level 3.    89South Jersey Industries, Inc.Part IIThe changes in fair value measurements of Derivatives – Energy Related Assets and Liabilities at December 31, 2011, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), are as follows (in thousands):  Year Ended December 31, 2011Balance at January 1, 2011 $(3,163)   Total gains and (losses) realized/unrealized included in earnings (7,988)   Transfers in and/or out of Level 3, net —   Settlements 5,193   Balance at December 31, 2011 $(5,958)  Year Ended December 31, 2010Balance at January 1, 2010 $(10,299)   Total gains and (losses) realized/unrealized included in earnings (774)   Transfers in and/or out of Level 3, net —   Settlements 7,910   Balance at December 31, 2010 $(3,163)    Total losses for 2011 included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held as of December 31, 2011, is $(8.0) million.  These losses are included in Operating Revenues-Nonutility on the consolidated statements of income.18.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:In February 2012, Energenic, a joint venture of which Marina has a 50% equity interest, entered into an agreement to acquire The Energy Network, LLC, a holding company for the Hartford Steam Company, TEN Companies and CNE Power I, LLC, for approximately $50.5 million.

Based on that evaluation, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures employed at the Company are effective.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under that framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included under this Item 9A.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere has not been any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B.
