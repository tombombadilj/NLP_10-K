Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of fresh food items, through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and national foodservice accounts. In addition to our flagship Starbucks brand, our portfolio also includes Tazo® Tea, Seattle’s Best Coffee®, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, Evolution Fresh™, La Boulange bakery brand and the Verismo™ System by Starbucks.Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this goal, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee products in a variety of forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels. Starbucks Global Responsibility strategy and commitments related to coffee and the communities we do business in, as well as our focus on being an employer of choice, are also key complements to our business strategies.In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (“fiscal 2012”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”Segment Financial InformationSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we redefined our reportable operating segments to align with the three-region leadership and organizational structure of our retail business that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012.The three-region structure includes: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as the “EMEA” region; and 3) China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”). Our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, manages these businesses, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions based on the new organizational structure. Accordingly, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we revised our reportable operating segments from 1) US, 2) International, and 3) Global Consumer Products Group to the following four reportable segments: 1) Americas, 2) EMEA, 3) CAP, and 4) Global Consumer Products Group. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we renamed our Global Consumer Products Group segment “Channel Development.”  Segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal year 2012 were as follows: Americas (75%), EMEA (9%), CAP (5%), and Channel Development (10%).Concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. Historical financial information presented herein reflects this change.The Americas, EMEA, and CAP segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within EMEA and CAP operations are in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than the Americas operations. The Americas and EMEA segments also include foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. Our Americas segment also includes the retail and wholesale activities of Bay Bread, LLC (doing business as La Boulange), which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. 2Table of ContentsOur Channel Development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo® teas, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, Starbucks® coffee and Tazo® tea K-Cup® portion packs, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, convenience stores, and US foodservice accounts.Seattle’s Best Coffee is reported in “Other” along with Evolution Fresh, Digital Ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. The Other category comprised approximately 1% of total net revenues. Financial information for Starbucks reportable operating segments and Other is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Revenue ComponentsWe generate our revenues through company-operated stores, licensed stores, consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and foodservice operations.

Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products, and by providing each customer a unique Starbucks Experience. The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service as well as clean and well-maintained company-operated stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including the maturity of the market.3Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of total company-operated store data for the periods indicated:  Net Stores Opened (Closed) During the Fiscal Year Ended(1) Stores Open as of Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011Americas:       US161 (2) 6,866 6,705Canada42 37 878 836Chile6 5 41 35Brazil25 5 53 28Puerto Rico— (2) 19 19Total Americas234 43 7,857 7,623EMEA:       UK(7) 5 593 600Germany7 8 157 150France5 8 67 62Switzerland4 — 50 46Austria— 2 12 12Netherlands1 2 3 2Total EMEA10 25 882 872CAP:       China130 58 408 278Thailand14 8 155 141Singapore8 8 80 72Australia2 (1) 23 21Total CAP154 73 666 512Total company-operated398 141 9,405 9,007(1)Store openings are reported net of closures.

In EMEA, 27 and 41 company-operated stores were opened during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 17 and 16 stores were closed during 2012 and 2011, respectively. In CAP, 161 and 87 company-operated stores were opened during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 7 and 14 stores were closed during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Starbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses, and in select rural and off-highway locations. To provide a greater degree of access and convenience for non-pedestrian customers, we continue to selectively expand development of drive-thru stores.Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular and decaffeinated coffee beverages, a broad selection of Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, iced shaken refreshment beverages, a selection of premium Tazo® teas, distinctively packaged roasted whole bean and ground coffees, a variety of Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew soluble coffees, Starbucks® coffee and Tazo® tea K-Cup® portion packs, Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, juices and bottled water. Starbucks stores also offer an assortment of fresh food items, including selections 4Table of Contentsfocusing on high-quality ingredients, nutritional value and great flavor. Food items include pastries, prepared breakfast and lunch sandwiches, oatmeal and salads. A focused selection of beverage-making equipment and accessories are also sold in our stores.

Customers who register their cards in the US, Canada, and certain other countries are enrolled in the My Starbucks Rewards™ program and can receive various benefits depending on the number of Stars earned in a 12-month period. Licensed StoresProduct sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 9% of total revenues in fiscal 2012. In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we receive royalties and license fees and sell coffee, tea and related products for resale in licensed locations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. For our Seattle’s Best Coffee brand, we use various forms of licensing, including traditional franchising.5Table of ContentsStarbucks total licensed stores by country as of September 30, 2012 are as follows:Americas Europe/Middle East/Africa China / Asia PacificUS4,262 Turkey171 Japan965Mexico356 UK168 South Korea467Canada303 United Arab Emirates99 China292Other125 Spain78 Taiwan271   Kuwait65 Philippines201   Saudi Arabia64 Malaysia134   Russia60 Indonesia133   Greece42 Hong Kong131   Other240 New Zealand34Total5,046 Total987 Total2,628In the Americas, 351 and 296 licensed stores were opened during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 81 and 564 licensed stores were closed during 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 564 licensed stores that were closed in the Americas during fiscal 2011 include 475 Seattle’s Best Coffee locations in Borders Bookstores. In EMEA, 139 and 111 licensed stores were opened during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 38 and 32 licensed stores were closed during 2012 and 2011, respectively. In CAP, 354 and 264 licensed stores were opened during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 60 and 71 licensed stores were closed during 2012 and 2011, respectively.Consumer Packaged GoodsConsumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores. It also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded products through licensing agreements. Revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised 8% of total net revenues in fiscal 2012.FoodserviceRevenues from foodservice accounts comprised 4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2012. We sell Starbucks® and Seattle’s Best Coffee® whole bean and ground coffees, a selection of premium Tazo® teas, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, and other coffee and tea related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry, education, healthcare, office coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants, airlines and other retailers. We also sell our Seattle’s Best Coffee® through arrangements with national accounts. The majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with SYSCO Corporation, US Foodservice™, and other distributors.Product SupplyStarbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards, for our many blends and single origin coffees.The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium 6Table of Contentsabove the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For these types of contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. Total green coffee purchase commitments as of September 30, 2012 were $854 million, comprised of $557 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $297 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. As of September 30, 2012, approximately $125 million of our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. All price-to-be-fixed contracts as of September 30, 2012 were at the Company’s option to fix the base “C” coffee commodity price component. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2013.We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.To help ensure sustainability and future supply of high-quality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates Farmer Support Centers in six countries. The Farmer Support Centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields.In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. For our largest markets, the US, Canada and the UK, we purchase substantially all of our fluid milk requirements from eight dairy suppliers. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include Evolution Fresh™ juices and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of these items is remote.CompetitionOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quick-service restaurants and specialty coffee shops. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the US quick-service restaurant sector and the US ready-to-drink coffee beverage market. We also continue to face competition from well-established companies in many international markets.7Table of ContentsOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through supermarkets, club stores and specialty retailers and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain NamesStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the US and in additional countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Frappuccino, Starbucks VIA and Tazo are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com”, “Starbucks.net”, and “Seattlesbest.com.”Seasonality and Quarterly ResultsOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. Cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced. Quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.EmployeesStarbucks employed approximately 160,000 people worldwide as of September 30, 2012. In the US, Starbucks employed approximately 120,000 people, with 113,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, and roasting and warehousing operations. Approximately 40,000 employees were employed outside of the US, with 38,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.Executive officers of the registrantName Age PositionHoward Schultz 59 chairman, president and chief executive officerCliff Burrows 53 president, Starbucks Coffee Americas and USJohn Culver 52 president, Starbucks Coffee China and Asia PacificJeff Hansberry 48 president, Channel Development and Emerging BrandsMichelle Gass 44 president, Starbucks Coffee EMEATroy Alstead 49 chief financial officer and chief administrative officerLucy Lee Helm 55 executive vice president, general counsel and secretary8Table of ContentsHoward Schultz is the founder of Starbucks and serves as the chairman, president and chief executive officer.

If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operation. •Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: •lower customer traffic or average value per transaction, which negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income, operating margins and earnings per share, due to: •the impact of initiatives by competitors and increased competition generally;  •customers trading down to lower priced products within Starbucks, and/or shifting to competitors with lower priced products; •lack of customer acceptance of new products or price increases necessary to cover costs of new products and/or higher input costs; •unfavorable general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate that adversely affect consumer spending; •declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products; or •adverse impacts resulting from negative publicity regarding our business practices or the health effects of consuming our products; •cost increases that are either wholly or partially beyond our control, such as: •commodity costs for commodities that can only be partially hedged, such as fluid milk and high-quality arabica coffee; 10Table of Contents•labor costs such as increased health care costs, general market wage levels and workers' compensation insurance costs; •adverse outcomes of current or future litigation; or •construction costs associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; •any material interruption in our supply chain beyond our control, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants or the failures of third-party suppliers, or interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, or trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions; •delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; •the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop, and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions, and enforce, commercial and other agreements; •the impact on our business, especially in our larger or fast growing markets, due to labor discord, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores or cause a material disruption in our supply chain; and •deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing. •Economic conditions in the US and certain international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit and lower home prices. Any resulting decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales de-leveraging which creates downward pressure on margins. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis. •We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: •successfully leveraging Starbucks brand portfolio outside the company-operated store base, including our increased focus on international licensed stores; •focusing on relevant product innovation and profitable new growth platforms;•continuing to accelerate the growth of our Channel Development business; •balancing disciplined global store growth and existing store renovation while meeting target store-level unit economics in a given market; •timely completing certain supply chain capacity expansion initiatives, including increased roasting capacity and construction of a new soluble products plant and a new Evolution FreshTM plant; and •executing a multi-channel advertising and marketing campaign to effectively communicate our message directly to Starbucks consumers and employees. 11Table of Contents•We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, service, convenience, and price, and we face significant competition in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the US, the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Increased competition in the US packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. •We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 75% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2012. If revenue trends slow or decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected, and because the Americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and for returning cash to shareholders. •We are increasingly dependent on the success of our EMEA and CAP operating segments in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our EMEA and CAP operating segments. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of our large MBUs. In particular, our Japan, UK, and China MBUs account for a significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our EMEA and CAP segments and a decline in the performance of any of these MBUs could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of the EMEA and CAP segments are different than those affecting our US stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the US or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the US due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations, such as in the US. Additionally, our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: •foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; •changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets; •interpretation and application of laws and regulations; •restrictive actions of foreign or US governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the US and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; •import or other business licensing requirements; •the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; 12Table of Contents•limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new US and international regulations; •in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving targeted levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; •difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; •local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; •delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and•disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. •Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and, although coffee prices have come down from their near-record highs of 2011, they are still above the historical average price of coffee and may again increase significantly due to factors described below. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.  These are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Although less material to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities including but not limited to those related to food inputs and energy, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 13Table of Contents•Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand has been highly rated in several global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of US, where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as contaminated food, recalls or privacy breaches, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.    •Our business depends in large part on the success of our business partners and suppliers, and our brand and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control. Our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, and licensee and partnership relationships, particularly in our international markets. Licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages, food and other products directly to customers. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a company-operated or licensed store. Any shortcoming of a Starbucks business partner, particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience, the safety of beverages or food or compliance with laws and regulations, may be attributed by customers to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations. Our food and beverage products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the US. A vendor's or supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could negatively impact our business and profitability. •Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.  14Table of Contents•The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.•Adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, as well as reports of incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering or food contamination, whether or not accurate, could harm our business. Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the US, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products. Similarly, instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply, food-borne illnesses, food tampering and food contamination, either during manufacturing, packaging or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food-borne illnesses, food tampering or food contamination could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. If customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, tampering or contamination, we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses, food tampering or food contamination, even those occurring solely at the restaurants or stores of competitors, could, by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, as well adverse results of claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. •Effectively managing growth both in our retail store business and our Channel Development business is challenging and places significant strain on our management and employees and our operational, financial, and other resources. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our Channel Development business, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. Growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed 15Table of Contentsenterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience. •As we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. We have recently completed several acquisitions and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures with third parties. These transactions create risks such as: •disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; •problems retaining key personnel; •operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquire or in which we invest; •the potential impairment of tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions; •the difficulty of incorporating an acquired business into our business and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; and •potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest In the event of any future acquisitions, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, incur debt, or take on contingent liabilities, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. •We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. We also rely on third party providers for some of these information technology systems and support. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause material negative impacts to our product sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem. Furthermore, security breaches of our employees' or customers' private data could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and could result in litigation, potential liability and the imposition of penalties. •The effect of changes to healthcare laws in the United States may increase the number of employees who choose to participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results. Since 1988 we have offered comprehensive healthcare coverage to eligible full-time and part-time employees in the US.  We currently have relatively low minimum work hour requirements for our US employees to be eligible for healthcare coverage under our healthcare plans but for various reasons many of our eligible employees choose not to participate in our plans.  However, many of such eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so when recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States become effective in 2014.  Such changes include potential fees to persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage and being ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if an employee is eligible for  healthcare coverage under an employer's plan.  If a large portion of current eligible employees who 16Table of Contentscurrently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll when or after the law becomes effective, it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs and negatively impact on our financial results.•Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, NASDAQ, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, privacy, food, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, together with the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements. Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesThe significant properties used by Starbucks in connection with its roasting, distribution and corporate administrative operations, serving all segments, are as follows:LocationApproximate Sizein Square Feet PurposeRancho Cucamonga, CA265,000 ManufacturingCarson Valley, NV384,000 Roasting, distribution and warehouseYork County, PA748,000 Roasting, distribution and warehouseSandy Run, SC117,000 Roasting and distributionAuburn, WA351,000 Warehouse and distributionKent, WA332,000 Roasting and distributionSeattle, WA1,000,000 Corporate administrative Amsterdam, Netherlands97,000 Roasting and distributionBasildon, United Kingdom142,000 Warehouse and distributionWe own our roasting facilities and lease the majority of our warehousing and distribution locations. As of September 30, 2012, Starbucks had approximately 9,400 company-operated stores, almost all of which are leased. We also lease space in various locations worldwide for regional, district and other administrative offices, training facilities and storage. Item 3.Legal ProceedingsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Starbucks notified Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (“Kraft”) that we were discontinuing our distribution arrangement with Kraft on March 1, 2011 due to material breaches by Kraft of its obligations under the Supply and License Agreement between the Company and Kraft, dated March 29, 2004 (the “Agreement”), which defined the main distribution arrangement between the parties. Through our arrangement with Kraft, Starbucks sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle's Best Coffee branded packaged coffees in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and 17Table of Contentsother European countries. Kraft managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products. Kraft denies it has materially breached the Agreement. On November 29, 2010, Starbucks received a notice of arbitration from Kraft putting the commercial dispute between the parties into binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. In addition to denying it materially breached the Agreement, Kraft further alleges that if Starbucks wished to terminate the Agreement it must compensate Kraft as provided in the Agreement in an amount equal to the fair value of the Agreement, with an additional premium of up to 35% under certain circumstances.On December 6, 2010, Kraft commenced a federal court action against Starbucks, entitled Kraft Foods Global, Inc. v. Starbucks Corporation, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) seeking injunctive relief to prevent Starbucks from terminating the distribution arrangement until the parties' dispute is resolved through the arbitration proceeding. On January 28, 2011, the District Court denied Kraft's request for injunctive relief. Kraft appealed the District Court's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 25, 2011, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision. As a result, Starbucks is in full control of our packaged coffee business as of March 1, 2011.While Starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement that allowed us to terminate the Agreement and certain other relationships with Kraft without compensation to Kraft, there exists the possibility of material adverse outcomes to Starbucks in the arbitration or to resolve the matter. Although Kraft disclosed to the press and in federal court filings a $750 million offer Starbucks made to Kraft in August 2010 to avoid litigation and ensure a smooth transition of the business, the figure is not a proper basis upon which to estimate a possible outcome of the arbitration but was based upon facts and circumstances at the time. Kraft rejected the offer immediately and did not provide a counter-offer, effectively ending the discussions between the parties with regard to any payment. Moreover, the offer was made prior to our investigation of Kraft's breaches and without consideration of Kraft's continuing failure to comply with material terms of the agreements.On April 2, 2012, Starbucks and Kraft exchanged expert reports regarding alleged damages on their affirmative claims. Starbucks claimed damages of up to $62.9 million from the loss of sales resulting from Kraft's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to market Starbucks® coffee, plus attorney fees. Kraft's expert opined that the fair market value of the Agreement was $1.9 billion. After applying a 35% premium and 9% interest, Kraft claimed damages of up to $2.9 billion, plus attorney fees.  The arbitration hearing commenced on July 11, 2012 and was completed on August 3.  Starbucks presented evidence of material breaches on Kraft's part and sought nominal damages from Kraft for those breaches.  Kraft presented evidence denying it had breached the parties' Agreement and sought damages of $2.9 billion plus attorney fees.  We expect a decision from the Arbitrator in the first half of fiscal 2013.At this time, Starbucks believes an unfavorable outcome with respect to the arbitration is not probable, but as noted above is reasonably possible. As also noted above, Starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement that allowed us to terminate the Agreement without compensation to Kraft. In addition, Starbucks believes Kraft's damage estimates are highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss. Accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter.Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.18Table of ContentsPART IIItem 5.Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesSHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONMARKET INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND POLICYStarbucks common stock is traded on NASDAQ, under the symbol “SBUX.”The following table shows the quarterly high and low sale prices per share of Starbucks common stock as reported by NASDAQ for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the quarterly cash dividend declared per share of our common stock during the periods indicated: High Low Cash DividendsDeclared2012:     Fourth Quarter$54.28 $43.04 $0.21Third Quarter62.00 51.03 0.17Second Quarter56.55 45.28 0.17First Quarter46.50 35.12 0.172011:     Fourth Quarter$42.00 $33.72 $0.17Third Quarter40.26 34.61 0.13Second Quarter38.21 30.75 0.13First Quarter33.15 25.37 0.13As of November 9, 2012, we had approximately 18,500 shareholders of record.

The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2010 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. The fiscal years ended on October 2, 2011 and September 30, 2012 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages for fiscal 2010 are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 14% to $13.3 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $11.7 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, 50% revenue growth in Channel Development, and  20% growth in licensed stores revenue. The comparable store sales growth in company-operated stores was comprised of a 6% increase in the number of transactions and a 1% increase in average ticket.•Consolidated operating income was $2.0 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2011 and operating margin increased to 15.0% compared to 14.8% in fiscal 2011. The operating margin expansion was driven by increased sales leverage and the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle's Best Coffee store closures in Border's bookstores, partially offset by higher commodity costs. •EPS for fiscal 2012 was $1.79, compared to EPS of $1.62 reported in fiscal 2011, with the increase driven by the improved sales leverage, partially offset by the impact of higher commodity costs in fiscal 2012 and certain gains recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, including a gain from a fair market value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture in Switzerland and Austria as well as a gain on the sale of corporate real estate. •Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures were approximately $856 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $532 million in fiscal 2011. Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 was directed at returning approximately $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2012 reflect the strength of our global business model. We continue to execute on our new regional operating model which we implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We now have four reportable operating segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); China / Asia Pacific ("CAP") and Channel Development. Each segment is managed by an operating segment president. Total net revenues increased 14% to $13.3 billion driven by global comparable store sales growth of 7% and a 50% increase in Channel Development revenue. This growth drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margin and net earnings compared to fiscal 2011. This helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $214 million for the year, equivalent to approximately 160 basis points of impact on operating margin. Our Americas business continued its strong momentum and contributed 75% of total net revenues in fiscal 2012. The revenue growth for the year was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. This sales growth, combined with a continued focus on operational efficiencies, drove increased sales leverage that offset the impact of higher commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue driving sales growth and profitability through continued store efficiency efforts, new store development, and expanding our pipeline of new product offerings to increase revenues throughout all dayparts.25Table of ContentsEMEA segment results reflect both the investments we have begun making as part of our transformation plan for the region, as well as the macro-economic headwinds we, and others, face there. This resulted in flat comparable store sales and operating income of $10 million for fiscal 2012, a decrease of $30 million compared to fiscal 2011. We started the year by putting in place a new leadership team that is focused on increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region, improving the profitability of the existing store base through a focus on revenue growth and operating costs, and identifying opportunities for new store growth through licensing arrangements. We expect the investments we are making as part of this transformation effort will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin; however, this turnaround will take time to gain traction.CAP segment revenues increased 31%, driven by new store growth and comparable store sales of 15%.  This segment continues to grow rapidly and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability. We expect continued growth will be from a mix of new store openings and comparable store sales growth. China continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us as we remain on track to reach our goal of 1,500 stores in 2015. In addition, other key markets such as Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia all continue to be profitable and provide a solid foundation for continued growth in the region.Our Channel Development segment represents another important, profitable growth opportunity for us. Channel Development results were a solid contributor to overall revenue growth with a 50% increase in revenues primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs which launched at the start of fiscal 2012 and our transition to a direct distribution model for packaged coffee, which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. High commodity costs continued to be a significant drag on operating margin; however, despite these higher costs, operating income increased $61 million to $349 million for fiscal 2012. We expect continued innovation and new product offerings such as the Verismo™ system by Starbucks and Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages will drive further growth and profitability within this segment over time.Fiscal 2013 — The View AheadFor fiscal year 2013, we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid single-digit increased comparable store sales, new store openings and strong growth in the Channel Development business. Licensed stores will comprise between one-half and two-thirds of new store openings.We expect continued robust consolidated operating margin and EPS improvement compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the strength of our global business and the pipeline of profitable growth initiatives. We expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting additional investments in store renovations, new store growth and manufacturing capacity.Operating Segment OverviewStarbucks has four reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), China and Asia Pacific ("CAP") and Channel Development. Seattle’s Best Coffee is reported in “Other,” along with Evolution Fresh, Digital Ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.The Americas, EMEA and CAP segments include company-operated stores and licensed stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee. The EMEA and CAP segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company-operated stores compared to the Americas segment; however, the Americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature Americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other segments. Average sales per store are also higher in the Americas due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. 26Table of ContentsStarbucks store base in EMEA and CAP continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher in certain international markets than in the Americas segment due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the Americas segment. International markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than the Americas.The Channel Development segment includes packaged coffee and tea, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, single-serve coffee and tea products and other branded product operations worldwide, as well as the US foodservice business. In prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011, we sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded packaged coffees and Tazo® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries through a distribution arrangement with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. Kraft managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement. During fiscal 2011, we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing, advertising, and promotion of these products, from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores. Our Channel Development segment also includes ready-to-drink beverages, which are primarily manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company. The proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included, on a net basis, in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broad-line distribution networks. The Channel Development segment reflects a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the other reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores.AcquisitionsSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):Revenues Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 %Change Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011         % of TotalNet Revenues Net revenues:          Company-operated stores$10,534.5 $9,632.4 9.4% 79.2% 82.3% Licensed stores1,210.3 1,007.5 20.1% 9.1% 8.6% CPG, foodservice and other1,554.7 1,060.5 46.6% 11.7% 9.1% Total net revenues$13,299.5 $11,700.4 13.7% 100.0% 100.0%Consolidated net revenues were $13.3 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 13.7%, or $1.6 billion over fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $902 million), driven by an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7%, or $680 million). Also contributing to the increase were 27Table of Contentsincremental revenues from net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $184 million).Licensed store revenues contributed $203 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from improved comparable store sales and the opening of 665 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $494 million, primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs launched in the CPG channel on November 1, 2011 (approximately $232 million). The benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea under the direct distribution model (approximately $78 million) and an increase in foodservice revenues (approximately $50 million) also contributed.Operating Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011       % of TotalNet Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs$5,813.3 $4,915.5 43.7% 42.0% Store operating expenses3,918.1 3,594.9 29.5% 30.7% Other operating expenses429.9 392.8 3.2% 3.4% Depreciation and amortization expenses550.3 523.3 4.1% 4.5% General and administrative expenses801.2 749.3 6.0% 6.4% Total operating expenses11,512.8 10,175.8 86.6% 87.0% Gain on sale of properties— 30.2 —% 0.3% Income from equity investees210.7 173.7 1.6% 1.5% Operating income$1,997.4 $1,728.5 15.0% 14.8% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues:        Store operating expenses    37.2% 37.3%Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 170 basis points, driven by increased commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points), primarily due to higher coffee costs.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, due to increased Channel Development and licensed store revenues.

As a percentage of net revenues excluding company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 350 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by increased sales leverage (approximately 150 basis points), the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle’s Best Coffee store closures in Borders bookstores (approximately 80 basis points) and a shift in the timing of marketing spend (approximately 60 basis points). Income from equity investees increased $37.0 million, primarily due to an increase in income from our North American Coffee Partnership (approximately $13 million), Japan (approximately $11 million) and Shanghai (approximately $10 million) joint venture operations.The combination of these changes, along with increased sales leverage on depreciation and amortization (approximately 40 basis points) and general and administrative expenses (approximately 40 basis points), resulted in an increase in operating margin of 20 basis points over fiscal 2011.28Table of ContentsOther Income and Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011       % of TotalNet Revenues Operating income$1,997.4 $1,728.5 15.0 % 14.8 % Interest income and other, net94.4 115.9 0.7 % 1.0 % Interest expense(32.7) (33.3) (0.2)% (0.3)% Earnings before income taxes2,059.1 1,811.1 15.5 % 15.5 % Income taxes674.4 563.1 5.1 % 4.8 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests1,384.7 1,248.0 10.4 % 10.7 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests0.9 2.3 — % — % Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$1,383.8 $1,245.7 10.4 % 10.6 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests    32.8 % 31.1 %Net interest income and other decreased $21 million over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in our previous joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million), partially offset by the recognition of additional income associated with unredeemed gifts cards in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately $29 million), following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws.Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2012 resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.8% compared to 31.1% for fiscal year 2011.  The rate increased in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2011 from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and the release of foreign valuation allowances. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be approximately 33%.29Table of ContentsSegment InformationSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.

Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 300 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 50 basis points) and the gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 (approximately 30 basis points).

The increase was primarily due to the benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model for the majority of the year (approximately $70 million). On March 1, 2011, we successfully transitioned to a direct distribution model from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft for the sale of packaged Starbucks® and Seattle’s Best Coffee® coffee products in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. We successfully transitioned the Tazo® tea business to a direct distribution model in January 2011.

This was partially offset by the impact of the closure of the Seattle’s Best Coffee locations in Borders Bookstores.Total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 15%, or $109 million. This increase is the result of an increase of $59 million in other operating expenses primarily due to the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 and an increase in marketing expenses. Also contributing was a $26 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to higher corporate expenses to support growth initiatives and higher donations to the Starbucks Foundation.

As of September 30, 2012, approximately $703 million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries, $343 million is denominated in the US dollar. We actively manage our cash and short-term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short-term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and US Agency securities. Also included in our short-term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service, with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year. The principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Our portfolio of long-term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment-grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers, as well as certificates of deposits with maturities greater than 1 year.Borrowing capacityIn November 2010, we replaced our previous credit facility with a new $500 million unsecured credit facility ("the credit facility”) with various banks, of which $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in November 2014. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 0.85% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon our long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.Under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not 41Table of Contentsexceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. Starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. During fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, a total of $18 million and $17 million, respectively, in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.Use of CashWe expect to use our cash and short-term investments, including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short-term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of September 30, 2012 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no US income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the US to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the US we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding.As discussed further in Note 15, we are in arbitration with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (“Kraft”) for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with Kraft. As a part of those proceedings Kraft has claimed damages inclusive of a premium and interest for terminating the arrangement. We believe we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement. We also believe Kraft’s claim is highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis. However, should the arbitration result in an unfavorable outcome, we believe we have adequate liquidity.Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2013 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; new company-operated stores; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.17 per share. Cash dividends paid in fiscal 2012 and 2011 totaled $513 million and $390 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid on November 30, 2012 with an expected payout of $157 million.42Table of ContentsDuring fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 12 million and 16 million shares of common stock ($593 million and $556 million, respectively) under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at September 30, 2012 totaled 12.1 million. On November 14, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 25 million shares under our share repurchase program.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2012, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2011. The slight increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings in fiscal 2012. This was partially offset by a net increase in our working capital accounts, due primarily to increased payments on accounts payable. Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal years 2012 and 2011. Net cash proceeds on investment maturities were offset by an increase in capital expenditures, primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company-operated stores and opening new retail stores, the absence of cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate in the prior year and cash paid to acquire Evolution Fresh and Bay Bread, LLC (doing business as La Boulange) in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012, respectively.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2012 totaled $746 million, compared to $608 million for fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal 2012.The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2012, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations(1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$4,060.2 $787.9 $1,368.9 $934.9 $968.5Purchase obligations(3)911.0 727.9 170.0 13.1 —Debt obligations(4)722.0 34.4 68.8 618.8 —Other obligations(5)94.9 19.4 9.6 8.3 57.6Total$5,788.1 $1,569.6 $1,617.3 $1,575.1 $1,026.1(1)Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 94% of total purchase obligations.(4)Debt amounts include principal maturities and scheduled interest payments on our long-term debt.(5)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments.Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.43Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2012 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):  Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase  inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease  inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase  inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease  inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$10 $(10) $13 $(13)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, we may engage in 44Table of Contentstransactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.As of September 30, 2012, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure.Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the period.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2012 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates.

The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 30, 2012 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 30, 2012 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions):    Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Debt$674 $29 $(29)Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component 45Table of Contentsof accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2012, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:Asset ImpairmentWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. For retail assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. These estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. For non-retail assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess long-lived asset impairment loss. For the foreseeable future, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill ImpairmentWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values.When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If not, we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. The fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a 46Table of Contentswilling buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit and require management to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies.As a part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss. For fiscal 2012, we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future. However, as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Self Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. These liabilities, which are associated with the risks that are retained by Starbucks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic, exposure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.Our self-insurance reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Periodically, we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our self-insurance reserves.47Table of ContentsDuring the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self-insurance reserves. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our self-insurance reserves for the foreseeable future. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at September 30, 2012 would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2012.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions; we recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available.Income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to US income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Litigation AccrualsWe are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. We record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims, as necessary.Our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims, if any, contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim. Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company’s legal and other contingent liability matters.48Table of ContentsAs we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals, we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses. Any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.Item 7A.Quantitative and

ContentsSTARBUCKS CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFiscal Years ended September 30, 2012, October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010 Note 1:     Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and national foodservice accounts. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”We have four reportable operating segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as “EMEA;” China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”) and Channel Development. Our Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment is reported in “Other” with Evolution Fresh, our Digital Ventures business and unallocated corporate expenses. Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are in Item 1 of this 10-K.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Investments in entities that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in entities in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2012 and 2011 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks, with the 53rdweek falling in the fourth fiscal quarter.Estimates and AssumptionsPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for asset and goodwill impairments, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, and inventory reserves; assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves and income from unredeemed stored value cards; and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions.Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are valued using active markets for identical assets. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances and we believe credit risk to be minimal.Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at 54Table of Contentscertain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets.Short-term and Long-term InvestmentsOur short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment grade debt securities, including some auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Also included in our available-for-sale investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short term. All other available-for-sale securities, including all of our auction rate securities, are classified as long term. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and whether we have the intent to sell or will likely be required to sell before the securities anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.We also have a trading securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in net earnings.Fair ValueFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For financial instruments and investments that we record or disclose at fair value, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price as of the last day of the fiscal period, if available. If a quoted market price is not available for identical assets, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price of similar assets or using a variety of other valuation methodologies. We determine fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads, and effective maturity.The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.We measure our equity and cost method investments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are determined to be other-than temporarily impaired. Fair values are determined using available quoted market prices or discounted cash flows.Derivative InstrumentsWe manage our exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency denominated revenues, purchases, assets and liabilities. We generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than five years.We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed coffee purchase commitments. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For these types of contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For both fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, we expect to take delivery of and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time and in the conduct of normal business. Accordingly, these purchase commitments qualify as normal purchases and are not recorded at fair value on our balance sheets.55Table of ContentsWe record all derivatives on the balance sheets at fair value. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. For a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. We classify the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally not removed until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. For discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in net interest income and other on the consolidated statements of earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. For net investment hedges, the spot-to-spot method is used to calculate effectiveness. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported as a component of OCI. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is reclassified into net earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in net interest income and other on the consolidated statements of earnings. Certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, and futures contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized in net interest income and other on the consolidated statements of earnings. Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAllowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical experience, customer credit risk and application of the specific identification method. As of September 30, 2012, October 2, 2011, and October 3, 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.6 million, $3.3 million, and $3.3 million respectively.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or market. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of September 30, 2012, October 2, 2011, and October 3, 2010, inventory reserves were $22.6 million, $19.5 million, and $18.1 million, respectively.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, which includes assets under capital leases, is provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years . For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in cost of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are retired or sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any remaining gain or loss recognized in net earnings.56Table of ContentsGoodwillWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If not, we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value.As a part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur. During Fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we recorded no impairment charges and recorded $1.6 million in fiscal 2010.Other Intangible AssetsOther intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks with indefinite lives, which are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of contract-based patents and copyrights, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Based on the impairment tests performed, there was no impairment of other intangible assets in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010.Long-lived AssetsWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. The fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for company-operated store assets are identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount, or fair value less estimated costs to sell.We recognized net impairment and disposition losses of $31.7 million, $36.2 million, and $67.7 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, primarily due to underperforming company-operated stores. Depending on the underlying asset that is impaired, these losses may be recorded in any one of the operating expense lines on the consolidated statements of earnings: for retail operations, the net impairment and disposition losses are recorded in store operating expenses and for all other operations, these losses are recorded in cost of sales including occupancy costs, other operating expenses, or general and administrative expenses.57Table of ContentsInsurance ReservesWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic, exposure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.Revenue RecognitionConsolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for licensees accounted for under the equity method, based on our percentage ownership. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates.Company-operated Stores RevenuesCompany-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Retail store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.Licensed Stores RevenuesLicensed stores revenues consist of product sales to licensed stores, as well as royalties and other fees paid by licensees to use the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.Initial nonrefundable development fees for licensed stores are recognized upon substantial performance of services for new market business development activities, such as initial business, real estate and store development planning, as well as providing operational materials and functional training courses for opening new licensed retail markets. Additional store licensing fees are recognized when new licensed stores are opened. Royalty revenues based upon a percentage of reported sales and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized on a monthly basis when earned.CPG, Foodservice and Other RevenuesCPG, foodservice and other revenues primarily consist of domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores, sales to our national foodservice accounts, and revenues from sales of products to and license revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded products through licensing agreements. Sales of coffee, tea, ready-to-drink beverages and related products to grocery and warehouse club stores are generally recognized when received by the customer or distributor, depending on contract terms. We maintain a sales return allowance to reduce packaged goods revenues for estimated future product returns based on historical patterns. Revenues are recorded net of sales discounts given to customers for trade promotions and payments to customers for product placement in our customers’ stores.Revenues from sales of products to manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded products through licensing agreements are generally recognized when the product is received by the manufacturer or distributor. License revenues from manufacturers are based on a percentage of sales and are recognized on a monthly basis when earned. National foodservice account revenues are recognized when the product is received by the customer or distributor.58Table of ContentsStored Value CardsRevenues from our stored value cards, primarily Starbucks Cards, are recognized when redeemed or when the likelihood of redemption, based on historical experience, is deemed to be remote. Outstanding customer balances are included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our stored value cards, and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While we will continue to honor all stored value cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, if management also determines there is no requirement for remitting balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may then be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings, in net interest income and other. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, October 2, 2011, and October 3, 2010, income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances was $65.8 million, $46.9 million, and $31.2 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we recognized additional income associated with unredeemed gift cards due to a recent court ruling relating to state unclaimed property laws. Customers in the US, Canada, and the UK who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the My Starbucks Reward program and earn points (“Stars”) with each purchase. Reward program members receive various benefits depending on the number of Stars earned in a 12-month period. The value of Stars earned by our program members towards free product is included in deferred revenue and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the Stars are earned, based on the value of Stars that are projected to be redeemed.Marketing & AdvertisingOur annual marketing expenses include many components, one of which is advertising costs. We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising campaign takes place.Annual marketing expenses totaled $277.9 million, $244.0 million, and $198.7 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Included in these costs were advertising expenses, which totaled  $182.4 million, $141.4 million, and $176.2 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.Store Preopening ExpensesCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new store openings are expensed as incurred.Operating LeasesWe lease retail stores, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space under operating leases. Most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, lease premiums, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. For purposes of recognizing incentives, premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use.For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, we record a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of earnings.For premiums paid upfront to enter a lease agreement, we record a deferred rent asset on the consolidated balance sheets and then amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as additional rent expense on the consolidated statements of earnings.For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, we record minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases on the consolidated statements of earnings.59Table of ContentsCertain leases provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. We record a contingent rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when we determine that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable.When ceasing operations in company-operated stores under operating leases, in cases where the lease contract specifies a termination fee due to the landlord, we record such expense at the time written notice is given to the landlord. In cases where terms, including termination fees, are yet to be negotiated with the landlord, we will record the expense upon signing of an agreement with the landlord. In cases where the landlord does not allow us to prematurely exit the lease, but allows for subleasing, we estimate the fair value of any sublease income that can be generated from the location and expense the present value of the excess of remaining lease payments to the landlord over the projected sublease income at the cease-use date.Asset Retirement ObligationsWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, our net ARO asset included in property, plant and equipment was $8.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively, and our net ARO liability included in other long-term liabilities was $42.6 million and $50.1 million, respectively.Stock-based CompensationWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We also have employee stock purchase plans (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expenses based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. For stock option awards we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to measure fair value. For restricted stock units, fair value is calculated using the stock price at the date of grant.Foreign Currency TranslationOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets.Income TaxesWe compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the 60Table of Contentstax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met.Common Stock Share RepurchasesWe may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings, once additional paid-in capital is depleted.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2012, the FASB issued guidance that revises the requirements around how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment. The guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, a quantitative calculation would not be needed. The guidance will become effective for us at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that revises the requirements around how entities test goodwill for impairment. The guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, a quantitative calculation would not be needed. We early-adopted this guidance effective for our fiscal 2012 annual goodwill impairment test, which we performed during the third fiscal quarter. The adoption of this guidance will result in a change in how we perform our goodwill impairment assessment; however, it will not have a material impact on our financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. The guidance requires entities to report the components of comprehensive income in either a single, continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance will become effective for us at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption of this new guidance will result in a change in how we present the components of comprehensive income, which is currently presented within our consolidated statements of equity.In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The guidance requires the disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion around the sensitivity of the measurements. This guidance became effective for us at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.61Table of ContentsReclassificationsChange in shared service allocationsEffective at the beginning of fiscal 2012, we implemented the previously announced strategic realignment of our organizational structure designed to accelerate our global growth strategy. A president for each region, reporting directly to our chief executive officer, now oversees the company-operated retail business working closely with both the licensed and joint-venture business partners in each market. The regional presidents also work closely with our Channel Development team to continue building out our brands and channels in each region.In connection with the changes to our organizational structure and reporting, we have changed the accountability for, and reporting of, certain indirect overhead costs. Certain indirect merchandising, manufacturing costs and back-office shared service costs, which were previously allocated to segment level costs of sales and operating expenses, are now managed at a corporate level and will be reported within unallocated corporate expenses. These expenses have therefore been removed from the segment level financial results. In order to conform prior period classifications with the new alignment, the historical consolidated financial statements have been recast with the following adjustments to previously reported amounts (in millions):  Year Ended October 2, 2011 As Filed Reclass As AdjustedTotal net revenues$11,700.4 $— $11,700.4Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,949.3 (33.8) 4,915.5Store operating expenses3,665.1 (70.2) 3,594.9Other operating expenses402.0 (9.2) 392.8Depreciation and amortization expenses523.3 — 523.3General and administrative expenses636.1 113.2 749.3Total operating expenses10,175.8 — 10,175.8Gain on sale of properties30.2 — 30.2Income from equity investees173.7 — 173.7Operating income$1,728.5 $— $1,728.5       Year Ended October 3, 2010 As Filed Reclass As AdjustedTotal net revenues$10,707.4 $— $10,707.4Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,458.6 (42.1) 4,416.5Store operating expenses3,551.4 (79.5) 3,471.9Other operating expenses293.2 (13.5) 279.7Depreciation and amortization expenses510.4 — 510.4General and administrative expenses569.5 135.1 704.6Restructuring charges53.0 — 53.0Total operating expenses9,436.1 — 9,436.1Income from equity investees148.1 — 148.1Operating income$1,419.4 $— $1,419.4There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings as a result of this change. Additional discussion regarding the change in our organizational structure and segment results is included at Note 17.62Table of ContentsChange in revenue presentation In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, concurrent with the change in our distribution method for packaged coffee and tea in the US, we revised the presentation of revenues. Non-retail licensing revenues were reclassified on the consolidated financial statements to the renamed “CPG, foodservice and other” revenue line, which includes revenues from our direct sale of packaged coffee and tea as well as licensing revenues received under the previous distribution arrangement. The previous “Licensing” revenue line now includes only licensed store revenue and therefore has been renamed “Licensed stores.” For fiscal 2010, $465.7 million was reclassified from the previously named Licensing revenue to CPG, foodservice and other revenue. There was no impact to consolidated or segment total net revenues from this change in presentation.Note 2:    AcquisitionsOn July 3, 2012, we acquired 100% ownership interest in Bay Bread, LLC and its La Boulange bakery brand (collectively “La Boulange”), to elevate our core food offerings and build a premium, artisanal bakery brand. We acquired La Boulange for a purchase price of approximately $100 million in cash. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date (in millions):  Fair Value at July 3, 2012Property, plant and equipment $18.1Intangible assets 24.3Goodwill 58.7Other current and noncurrent assets 5.1Current liabilities (6.4)Total cash paid $99.8The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our Americas operating segment. Other current assets acquired primarily include cash, trade receivables, and inventory. In addition, we assumed various current liabilities primarily consisting of accounts payable and accrued payroll related liabilities. The intangible assets acquired as part of the transaction include the La Boulange trade name and proprietary recipes and processes. The La Boulange trade name was valued at $9.7 million and determined to have an indefinite life while the intangible asset relating to the proprietary recipes and processes was valued at $14.6 million and will be amortized over a period of 10 years. The $58.7 million of goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes and was allocated to our Americas operating segment.On November 10, 2011, we acquired the outstanding shares of Evolution Fresh, Inc., a super-premium juice company, to expand our portfolio of product offerings and enter into the super-premium juice market. We acquired Evolution Fresh for a purchase price of $30 million in cash. The fair value of the net assets acquired on the acquisition date included $18 million of goodwill. Evolution Fresh is its own operating segment and is reported in “Other” along with our Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment, our Digital Ventures business, and unallocated corporate expenses.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we acquired the 50% ownership interest in Switzerland and Austria from our joint venture partner, Marinopoulos Holdings S.A.R.L, converting these markets to 100% owned company-operated markets, for a purchase price of $65.5 million. As a result of this acquisition, we adjusted the carrying value of our previous equity investment to fair value, resulting in a gain of approximately $55 million which was included in net interest income and other on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of 100% of the net assets of these markets on the acquisition date was $131.0 million and was recorded on our consolidated 63Table of Contentsbalance sheets. Included in these net assets were $63.8 million of goodwill and $35.1 million in definite-lived intangible assets.In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we acquired the remaining 30% ownership of our business in the southern portion of China from our noncontrolling partner, Maxim’s Caterers Limited (Maxim’s). We simultaneously sold our 5% ownership interest in the Hong Kong market to Maxim’s.In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired 100% ownership of our business in France, converting it from a 50% joint venture with Sigla S.A. (Grupo Vips) of Spain to a company-operated market. We simultaneously sold our 50% ownership interests in the Spain and Portugal markets to Grupo Vips, converting them to licensed markets.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired 100% ownership of our business in Brazil, converting it from a 49% joint venture with Cafés Sereia do Brasil Participações S.A of Brazil to a company-operated market.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired 100% ownership of a previously consolidated 50% joint venture in the US with Johnson Coffee Corporation, Urban Coffee Opportunities (“UCO”).The following table shows the effects of the change in Starbucks ownership interest in UCO and our business in South China on Starbucks equity:Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2012 October 2, 2011 October 3, 2010Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$1,383.8 $1,245.7 $945.6Transfers (to) from the noncontrolling interest:     Decrease in additional paid-in capital for purchase of interest in subsidiary— (28.0) (26.8)Change from net earnings attributable to Starbucks and transfers to noncontrolling interest$1,383.8 $1,217.7 $918.8Note 3:    Derivative Financial InstrumentsForeign Currency We enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated revenue streams and inventory purchases in currencies other than the entity's functional currency.  Net derivative losses from cash flow hedges of $2.9 million and $11.1 million, net of taxes, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively. Of the net derivative losses accumulated as of September 30, 2012, $2.9 million pertains to derivative instruments that will be dedesignated as cash flow hedges within 12 months and will also continue to experience fair value changes before affecting earnings. Outstanding contracts will expire within 12 months.We also enter into net investment derivative instruments to hedge our equity method investment in Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd., to minimize foreign currency exposure. Net derivative losses from net investment hedges of  $33.6 million and $34.2 million, net of taxes, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of  September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively. Outstanding contracts will expire within 29 months.In addition to the hedging instruments above, to mitigate the translation risk of certain balance sheet items, we enter into certain foreign currency swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized in net interest income and other on the consolidated statements of earnings. Gains and losses from these instruments are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency denominated payables and receivables, which is also recognized in net interest income and other.64Table of ContentsCoffeeDepending on market conditions, we also enter into futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 1. Net derivative losses of $32.9 million, net of taxes, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2012 related to coffee hedges.  Of the net derivative losses accumulated as of September 30, 2012, $26.9 million pertains to derivative instruments that will be dedesignated as cash flow hedges within 12 months and will also continue to experience fair value changes before affecting earnings. Outstanding contracts will expire within 15 months. There was insignificant coffee hedge activity in fiscal 2011.DairyTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases of dairy products, we enter into certain futures contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized in net interest income and other. Gains and losses from these instruments are largely offset by price fluctuations on our dairy purchases which are included in cost of sales.Diesel FuelTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases of diesel fuel, we enter into certain swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized in net interest income and other. Gains and losses from these instruments are largely offset by the financial impact of diesel fuel fluctuations on our shipping costs which are included in operating expenses.The following table presents the pretax effect of derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments on earnings and other comprehensive income ("OCI") for fiscal years ending (in millions): Foreign Currency CoffeeSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011        Cash Flow Hedges:       Gain/(Loss) recognized in earnings$(11.5) $(15.9) $(3.4) $—Gain/(Loss) recognized in OCI$(2.5) $(12.1) $(39.8) $—Net Investment Hedges:       Gain/(Loss) recognized in earnings$— $—    Gain/(Loss) recognized in OCI$1.1 $(12.0)    The amounts shown in the above table as recognized in earnings for foreign currency and coffee hedges represent the realized gains/(losses) reclassified from OCI to net earnings during the year. The amounts shown as recognized in OCI are prior to these reclassifications.The following table presents the pretax effect of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments on earnings for fiscal years ending (in millions):  Foreign Currency Coffee Dairy Diesel Fuel Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011Gain/(Loss) recognized in earnings$(2.2) $0.7 $— $(0.9) $7.8 $5.7 $3.1 $1.165Table of ContentsNotional amounts of outstanding derivative contracts (in millions): Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011Foreign currency$383 $499Coffee125 66Dairy72 10Diesel fuel$24 $—Note 4:    Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis (in millions):   Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Balance atSeptember 30, 2012 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets for Identical Assets(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservable  Inputs(Level 3)Assets:       Cash and cash equivalents$1,188.6 $1,188.6 $— $—Short-term investments:       Available-for-sale securities       Agency obligations80.0 — 80.0 —Commercial paper103.9 — 103.9 —Corporate debt securities84.3 — 84.3 —Government treasury securities459.7 459.7 — —Certificates of deposit62.9 — 62.9 —Total available-for-sale securities790.8 459.7 331.1 —Trading securities57.6 57.6 — —Total short-term investments848.4 517.3 331.1 —Long-term investments:       Available-for-sale securities       Agency obligations14.0 — 14.0 —Corporate debt securities61.3 — 61.3 —Auction rate securities18.6 — — 18.6Certificates of deposit22.1 — 22.1 —Total long-term investments116.0 — 97.4 18.6Total$2,153.0 $1,705.9 $428.5 $18.6Liabilities:       Short-term derivatives:              Foreign Currency$10.1 $— $10.1 $—       Coffee8.8 — 8.8 —Total short-term derivatives18.9 — 18.9 —Long-term derivatives:              Foreign Currency3.0 — 3.0 —Total long-term derivatives3.0 — 3.0 —Total$21.9 $— $21.9 $—66Table of Contents   Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Balance atOctober 2, 2011 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets for Identical Assets(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservable  Inputs(Level 3)Assets:       Cash and cash equivalents$1,148.1 $1,148.1 $— $—Short-term investments:       Available-for-sale securities       Agency obligations20.0 — 20.0 —Commercial paper87.0 — 87.0 —Corporate debt securities78.0 — 78.0 —Government treasury securities606.0 606.0 — —Certificates of deposit64.0 — 64.0 —Total available-for-sale securities855.0 606.0 249.0 —Trading securities47.6 47.6 — —Total short-term investments902.6 653.6 249.0 —Long-term investments:       Available-for-sale securities       Corporate debt securities67.0 — 67.0 —Auction rate securities28.0 — — 28.0Certificates of deposit12.0 — 12.0 —Total long-term investments107.0 — 79.0 28.0Total$2,157.7 $1,801.7 $328.0 $28.0Liabilities:       Short-term derivatives:              Foreign Currency$20.1 $— $20.1 $—       Coffee1.2 — 1.2 —Total short-term derivatives21.3 — 21.3 —Long-term derivatives:              Foreign Currency9.9 — 9.9 —Total long-term derivatives9.9 — 9.9 —Total$31.2 $— $31.2 $—Short-term and long-term derivatives are included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively.Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on investments were not material as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011.Available-for-sale SecuritiesAvailable-for-sale securities include government treasury securities, corporate and agency bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service and auction rate securities (“ARS”). Level 1: For government treasury securities, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. 67Table of ContentsLevel 2: For corporate and agency bonds, for which a quoted market price is not available for identical assets, we determine fair value based upon the quoted market price of similar assets or the present value of expected future cash flows, calculated by applying revenue multiples to estimate future operating results and using discount rates appropriate for the duration and the risks involved. Fair values for commercial paper are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current imputed interest rates of similar securities. Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to aggregate expected maturities.Level 3: We determine fair value of our ARS using an internally developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads, and effective maturity. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities were $5.0 million, $0.0 million, and $1.1 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 realized gains and losses on sales and maturities were not material.Certificates of deposit have maturity dates ranging from approximately one month to 2 years and principal amounts, that when aggregated with interest that will accrue over the investment term, will not exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Certificates of deposit with original maturities of 90 days or less are included in cash and cash equivalents. The amounts invested in certificate of deposits that were included in cash and cash equivalents were $0.2 million and $4.2 million as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively. Long-term investments (except for ARS) generally mature within 3 years. ARS have long-dated maturities but provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined calendar intervals. Our ARS are collateralized by portfolios of student loans, substantially all of which are guaranteed by the United States Department of Education. Due to the auction failures that began in 2008, these securities became illiquid and were classified as long-term investments. The investment principal associated with the failed auctions will not be accessible until:•successful auctions resume;•an active secondary market for these securities develops;•the issuers replace these securities with another form of financing; or•final payments are made according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues which range from 18 to 32 years.We do not intend to sell the ARS, nor is it likely we will be required to sell the ARS before their anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity.Trading SecuritiesTrading securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. For these securities, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value, thus these securities are considered Level 1 instruments. Our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of the liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”), a defined contribution plan. The corresponding deferred compensation liability of $94.8 million and $84.7 million as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively, is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The changes in net unrealized holding gains/losses in the trading portfolio included in earnings for fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were a net gain of $10.9 million, a net loss of $2.1 million, and a net gain of $4.1 million, respectively.Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesDerivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and futures contracts. Where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical derivative assets and liabilities that are traded on exchanges. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are over-the-counter currency forward contracts and commodity swaps whose fair values are estimated using industry-standard valuation models. Such models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-68Table of Contentsbased observable inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities.Changes in Level 3 Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial instruments measured using Level 3 inputs described above are comprised entirely of our ARS. Changes in this balance related primarily to calls of certain of our ARS. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, $10.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of our ARS were called at par. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and cost method investments, and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired.During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recognized fair market value adjustments with a charge to earnings for these assets as follows: Year Ended September 30, 2012 CarryingValue beforeadjustment Fair valueadjustment Carryingvalue afteradjustmentProperty, plant and equipment (1)$21.5 $(14.4) $7.1 Year Ended October 2, 2011 CarryingValue beforeadjustment Fair valueadjustment Carryingvalue afteradjustmentProperty, plant, and equipment (1)$8.8 $(5.9) $2.9Other assets (2)$22.1 $(22.1) $—(1)These assets primarily consist of leasehold improvements in underperforming stores. The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on expected future store revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. The resulting impairment charge was included in store operating expenses.(2)The fair value was determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, and/or comparable company analyses. The resulting impairment charge was included in other operating expenses.Fair Value of Other Financial InstrumentsThe estimated fair value of the $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes based on the quoted market price (Level 2) was approximately $674 million and $648 million as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively.69Table of ContentsNote 5:    Inventories (in millions) September 30, 2012 October 2, 2011Coffee:   Unroasted$711.3 $431.3Roasted222.2 246.5Other merchandise held for sale181.6 150.8Packaging and other supplies126.4 137.2Total$1,241.5 $965.8Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of September 30, 2012, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $557 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $297 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. As of September 30, 2012, approximately $125 million of our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.Note 6:    Equity and Cost Investments (in millions) September 30, 2012 October 2, 2011Equity method investments$393.9 $334.4Cost method investments66.0 37.9Total$459.9 $372.3Equity Method InvestmentsAs of September 30, 2012, we had a 50 percent ownership interest in each of the following international equity investees: Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd.; President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Ltd.; Shanghai President Coffee Co.; Berjaya Starbucks Coffee Company Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia); and Tata Starbucks Limited (India). In addition, we had a 39.6 percent ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. These international entities operate licensed Starbucks retail stores. We also have licensed the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks branded products to The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company. We have a 50 percent ownership interest in The North American Coffee Partnership, which develops and distributes bottled Frappuccino® beverages, Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, Seattle’s Best Coffee® ready-to-drink espresso beverages and Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages.Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross margin resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these related parties, net of eliminations, were $190.3 million, $151.6 million, and $125.7 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Related costs of sales, net of eliminations, were $111.0 million, $83.2 million, and $65.3 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, there were $33.0 million and $31.9 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues.70Table of ContentsAs of September 30, 2012, the aggregate market value of our investment in Starbucks Japan was approximately $400 million, determined based on its available quoted market price, which exceeds its carrying value of $201 million.Summarized combined financial information of our equity method investees, which represent 100% of the investees’ financial information (in millions):Financial Position as ofSeptember 30, 2012 October 2, 2011Current assets$603.1 $476.9Noncurrent assets735.3 651.4Current liabilities411.2 340.1Noncurrent liabilities119.7 80.2 Results of Operations for Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2012 October 2, 2011 October 3, 2010Net revenues$2,796.7 $2,395.1 $2,128.0Operating income353.5 277.0 245.3Net earnings286.7 231.1 205.1Cost Method InvestmentsAs of September 30, 2012, we had a $41 million investment of equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed retail stores in several global markets. We have the ability to acquire additional interests in some of these cost method investees at certain intervals. Depending on our total percentage of ownership interest and our ability to exercise significant influence over financial and operating policies, additional investments may require a retroactive application of the equity method of accounting.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we made a $25 million investment in the preferred stock of Square, Inc. In addition, in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Square, we also received warrants to purchase common stock of Square that are subject to certain vesting conditions.

The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in November 2014. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility at the end of fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011.The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 0.85% over LIBOR The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon our long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage 73Table of Contentsratio. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses.Under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. We may issue commercial paper from time to time and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. No borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program at the end of fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011.As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, a total of $18 million and $17 million, respectively, in letters of credit were outstanding under the respective revolving credit facility.Long-term DebtIn August 2007, we issued $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes (“the notes”) due in August 2017, in an underwritten registered public offering. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, which limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, the carrying value of the notes, recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, was $549.6 million and $549.5 million, respectively.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $32.7 million, $33.3 million, and $32.7 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, $3.2 million, $4.4 million, and $4.9 million, respectively, of interest was capitalized for asset construction projects.Note 10:    LeasesRental expense under operating lease agreements (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Minimum rentals$759.0 $715.6 $688.5Contingent rentals44.7 34.3 26.1Total$803.7 $749.9 $714.6Minimum future rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of September 30, 2012 (in millions):Fiscal Year Ending 2013$787.92014728.52015640.42016531.52017403.4Thereafter968.5Total minimum lease payments$4,060.2We have subleases related to certain of our operating leases.

We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).As of September 30, 2012, there were 24.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 8.1 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP.76Table of ContentsStock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Options$46.2 $60.4 $76.8Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)107.4 84.8 36.8Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings$153.6 $145.2 $113.6Total related tax benefit54.2 51.2 40.6Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment and inventories on the consolidated balance sheets2.0 2.1 1.9Stock Option PlansStock options to purchase our common stock are granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The majority of options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the date of grant and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest over one to three years. Nearly all outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our experience. Options granted are valued using the multiple option valuation approach, and the resulting expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010: Employee Stock OptionsGranted During the PeriodFiscal Year Ended2012 2011 2010Expected term (in years)4.8 5.0 4.7Expected stock price volatility38.2% 39.0% 43.0%Risk-free interest rate1.0% 1.6% 2.1%Expected dividend yield1.5% 1.7% 0.1%Weighted average grant price$44.26 $31.46 $22.28Estimated fair value per option granted$12.79 $9.58 $8.50The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise, and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on the anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded on the consolidated statements of earnings.77Table of ContentsThe BSM option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because our stock options do not trade on a secondary exchange, employees do not derive a benefit from holding stock options unless there is an increase, above the grant price, in the market price of our stock. Such an increase in stock price would benefit all shareholders commensurately.Stock option transactions from September 27, 2009 through September 30, 2012 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts): SharesSubject toOptions WeightedAverageExercisePriceper Share WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife (Years) AggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding, September 27, 200963.6 $14.75 6.7 $442Granted14.9 22.28    Exercised(9.6) 11.94    Expired/forfeited(8.2) 18.73    Outstanding, October 3, 201060.7 16.52 6.6 611Granted4.3 31.46    Exercised(16.1) 14.40    Expired/forfeited(3.6) 18.06    Outstanding, October 2, 201145.3 18.57 6.4 848Granted3.4 44.26    Exercised(13.6) 15.99    Expired/forfeited(2.0) 20.67    Outstanding, September 30, 201233.1 22.19 6.1 945Exercisable, September 30, 201218.4 19.96 5.0 567Vested and expected to vest, September 30, 201232.0 21.92 6.0 923The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated.The following is a summary of stock options outstanding at the end of fiscal 2012 (shares in millions): Options Outstanding Options ExercisableRange of PricesNumber ofOptions WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice Number ofOptions WeightedAverageExercisePriceUnder $10.009.0 6.0 $8.65 5.0 $8.65$10.01 - $20.003.6 3.7 15.14 3.3 15.22$20.01 - $30.0010.8 6.0 23.14 6.5 23.91Over $30.009.7 7.1 36.36 3.6 32.89 33.1 6.1 $22.19 18.4 $19.9678Table of ContentsAs of September 30, 2012, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options was approximately $35 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.3 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $440 million, $323 million, and $118 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $59 million, $126 million, and $108 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.RSUsWe have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee’s continuing employment. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals for the full fiscal year in the year of award and the grantee remains employed during the subsequent vesting period. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved.RSU transactions from September 27, 2009 through September 30, 2012 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts): NumberofShares WeightedAverageGrant DateFair Valueper Share WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife (Years) AggregateIntrinsicValueNonvested, September 27, 20094.4 $11.55 1.6 $88Granted2.3 22.27    Vested(0.7) 16.35    Forfeited/cancelled(0.6) 12.27    Nonvested, October 3, 20105.4 13.55 1.1 141Granted5.4 31.06    Vested(1.7) 9.40    Forfeited/cancelled(0.8) 25.68    Nonvested, October 2, 20118.3 23.11 0.8 309Granted4.1 44.05    Vested(4.2) 18.93    Forfeited/cancelled(0.9) 35.56    Nonvested, September 30, 20127.3 34.68 0.9 366As of September 30, 2012, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $80 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years.ESPPOur ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95% of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.4 million in fiscal 2012.79Table of ContentsDeferred Stock PlanWe have a deferred stock plan for certain key-employees that enables participants in the plan to defer receipt of ownership of common shares from the exercise of nonqualified stock options. The minimum deferral period is 5 years. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, 3.4 million shares were deferred under the terms of this plan. The rights to receive these shares, represented by common stock units, are included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as common stock equivalents. No new initial deferrals are permitted under this plan; the plan permits re-deferrals of previously deferred shares.Defined Contribution PlansWe maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws.Our matching contributions to all US and non-US plans were $59.8 million, $45.5 million, and $23.5 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.Note 13:    Income TaxesThe components of earnings before income taxes were as follows (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010United States$1,679.6 $1,523.4 $1,308.9Foreign379.5 287.7 128.1Total earnings before income taxes$2,059.1 $1,811.1 $1,437.0Provision for income taxes (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Current taxes:     Federal$466.0 $344.7 $457.5State79.9 61.2 79.6Foreign76.8 37.3 38.3Total current taxes622.7 443.2 575.4Deferred taxes:     Federal49.2 111.6 (76.0)State(0.7) 8.3 (9.3)Foreign3.2 — (1.4)Total deferred taxes51.7 119.9 (86.7)Total provision for income taxes$674.4 $563.1 $488.780Table of ContentsReconciliation of the statutory US federal income tax rate with our effective income tax rate:Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Statutory rate35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit2.5 % 2.5 % 2.5 %Benefits and taxes related to foreign operations(3.3)% (3.1)% (2.5)%Domestic production activity deduction(0.7)% (0.8)% (0.9)%Other, net(1)(0.7)% (2.5)% (0.1)%Effective tax rate32.8 % 31.1 % 34.0 %(1)Fiscal 2011 includes a benefit of 0.9% related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Switzerland and Austria.US income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $1.5 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity investees.

If these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation, and the amount of liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.81Table of ContentsTax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that comprise significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions): Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011Deferred tax assets:   Property, plant and equipment$62.7 $46.4Accrued occupancy costs72.0 55.9Accrued compensation and related costs66.9 69.6Other accrued liabilities15.7 27.8Asset retirement obligation asset20.1 19.0Deferred revenue43.7 47.8Asset impairments38.5 60.0Tax credits14.6 23.0Stock based compensation131.8 128.8Net operating losses99.2 85.5Other80.9 58.6Total$646.1 $622.4Valuation allowance(154.2) (137.4)Total deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance$491.9 $485.0Deferred tax liabilities:   Property, plant and equipment(89.0) (66.4)Intangible assets and goodwill(34.0) (25.2)Other(44.8) (18.1)Total(167.8) (109.7)Net deferred tax asset$324.1 $375.3Reported as:   Current deferred income tax assets$238.7 $230.4Long-term deferred income tax assets (included in Other assets)97.3 156.3Current deferred income tax liabilities (included in Accrued liabilities)(1.3) (4.9)Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (included in Other long-term liabilities)(10.6) (6.5)Net deferred tax asset$324.1 $375.3We will establish a valuation allowance if either it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will expire before we are able to realize the benefit, or the future deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on our assessments of the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011 is primarily related to net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, was an increase of $16.8 million and $49.3 million, respectively. During fiscal 2011, we recognized approximately $32 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions, with a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of their realization.82Table of ContentsAs of September 30, 2012, Starbucks has utilized all of its foreign tax credits and no longer has a foreign tax credit carryforward. Starbucks has a capital loss carryforward of $7.1 million, with an expiration date of 2015, and foreign net operating losses of $318 million, with the predominant amount having no expiration date.Taxes currently payable of $50.8 million and $30.1 million are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 30, 2012, we had $75.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $39.7 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we had accrued interest and penalties of $5.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, before the benefit of the federal tax deduction, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Beginning balance52.9 68.4 49.1Increase related to prior year tax positions8.8 4.4 35.0Decrease related to prior year tax positions— (32.3) (21.4)Increase related to current year tax positions20.0 26.0 14.1Decrease related to current year tax positions(1.1) (0.8) (8.1)Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities(0.5) (5.0) —Decreases related to lapsing of statute of limitations(4.8) (7.8) (0.3)Ending balance75.3 52.9 68.4We are currently under routine audit by various jurisdictions outside the US as well as US state taxing jurisdictions for fiscal years 2006 through 2011. We are no longer subject to US federal or state examination for years prior to fiscal year 2009, with the exception of seven states. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the US. We are no longer subject to examination in any material international markets prior to 2006. There is a reasonable possibility that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within 12 months, but we do not expect this change to be material to the consolidated financial statements.Note 14:    Earnings per ShareCalculation of net earnings per common share (“EPS”) — basic and diluted (in millions, except EPS):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$1,383.8 $1,245.7 $945.6Weighted average common shares and common stock units outstanding (for basic calculation)754.4 748.3 744.4Dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options and RSUs18.6 21.4 19.8Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (for diluted calculation)773.0 769.7 764.2EPS — basic$1.83 $1.66 $1.27EPS — diluted$1.79 $1.62 $1.2483Table of ContentsPotential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Out-of-the-money stock options totaled 0.2 million, 0.1 million, and 7.9 million as of September 30, 2012, October 2, 2011, and October 3, 2010, respectively.Note 15:    Commitments and ContingenciesLegal ProceedingsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Starbucks notified Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (“Kraft”) that we were discontinuing our distribution arrangement with Kraft on March 1, 2011 due to material breaches by Kraft of its obligations under the Supply and License Agreement between the Company and Kraft, dated March 29, 2004 (the “Agreement”), which defined the main distribution arrangement between the parties. Through our arrangement with Kraft, Starbucks sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle's Best Coffee branded packaged coffees in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. Kraft managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products. Kraft denies it has materially breached the Agreement. On November 29, 2010, Starbucks received a notice of arbitration from Kraft putting the commercial dispute between the parties into binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. In addition to denying it materially breached the Agreement, Kraft further alleges that if Starbucks wished to terminate the Agreement it must compensate Kraft as provided in the Agreement in an amount equal to the fair value of the Agreement, with an additional premium of up to 35% under certain circumstances.On December 6, 2010, Kraft commenced a federal court action against Starbucks, entitled Kraft Foods Global, Inc. v. Starbucks Corporation, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) seeking injunctive relief to prevent Starbucks from terminating the distribution arrangement until the parties' dispute is resolved through the arbitration proceeding. On January 28, 2011, the District Court denied Kraft's request for injunctive relief. Kraft appealed the District Court's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 25, 2011, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision. As a result, Starbucks is in full control of our packaged coffee business as of March 1, 2011.While Starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement that allowed us to terminate the Agreement and certain other relationships with Kraft without compensation to Kraft, there exists the possibility of material adverse outcomes to Starbucks in the arbitration or to resolve the matter. Although Kraft disclosed to the press and in federal court filings a $750 million offer Starbucks made to Kraft in August 2010 to avoid litigation and ensure a smooth transition of the business, the figure is not a proper basis upon which to estimate a possible outcome of the arbitration but was based upon facts and circumstances at the time. Kraft rejected the offer immediately and did not provide a counter-offer, effectively ending the discussions between the parties with regard to any payment. Moreover, the offer was made prior to our investigation of Kraft's breaches and without consideration of Kraft's continuing failure to comply with material terms of the agreements.On April 2, 2012, Starbucks and Kraft exchanged expert reports regarding alleged damages on their affirmative claims. Starbucks claimed damages of up to $62.9 million from the loss of sales resulting from Kraft's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to market Starbucks® coffee, plus attorney fees. Kraft's expert opined that the fair market value of the Agreement was $1.9 billion. After applying a 35% premium and 9% interest, Kraft claimed damages of up to $2.9 billion, plus attorney fees.  The arbitration hearing commenced on July 11, 2012 and was completed on August 3.  Starbucks presented evidence of material breaches on Kraft's part and sought nominal damages from Kraft for those breaches.  Kraft presented evidence denying it had breached the parties' Agreement and sought damages of $2.9 billion plus attorney fees.  We expect a decision from the Arbitrator in the first half of fiscal 2013.84Table of ContentsAt this time, Starbucks believes an unfavorable outcome with respect to the arbitration is not probable, but as noted above is reasonably possible. As also noted above, Starbucks believes we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement that allowed us to terminate the Agreement without compensation to Kraft. In addition, Starbucks believes Kraft's damage estimates are highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss. Accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter.Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Note 16:    Restructuring ChargesThe restructuring efforts we began in fiscal 2008 to rationalize our store portfolio and the non-retail support organization were completed in fiscal 2010. On a cumulative basis we closed 918 stores on a global basis as part of this effort.Restructuring charges by type of cost for fiscal 2010 were as follows (in millions):  By Type of Cost  Total Lease Exitand OtherRelated Costs AssetImpairments EmployeeTerminationCostsCosts incurred and charged to expense in fiscal 2010 $53.0 $53.0 $0.2 $(0.2)Accrued liability as of October 3, 2010(1) $89.2 $89.2 $— $—Cash payments (27.1) (27.1) — —Other 0.5 0.5 — —Accrued liability as of October 2, 2011(1) $62.6 $62.6 $— $—Cash payments (18.7) (18.7) — —Other (5.3) (5.3) — —Accrued liability as of September 30, 2012(1) $38.6 $38.6 $— $—(1)The remaining liability relates to lease obligations for stores that were previously closed where Starbucks has been unable to terminate the lease or find subtenants for the unused space.For fiscal 2010, $28.4 million, $24.5 million and $0.1 million of restructuring charges were recorded to the Americas, EMEA, and CAP segments, respectively. Note 17:    Segment ReportingSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we redefined our reportable operating segments to align with the three-region leadership and organizational structure of our retail business that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012.The three-region structure includes: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as the “EMEA” region; and 3) China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”). Our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker manages these businesses, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions based on the new organizational structure. Accordingly, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we revised our reportable operating segments from 1) US, 2) International, and 3) Global Consumer Products Group to the following four reportable segments: 1) Americas, 2) CAP, 3) 85Table of ContentsEMEA, and 4) Global Consumer Products Group. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we renamed our Global Consumer Products Group segment “Channel Development.” Segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended 2012 were as follows: Americas (75%), EMEA (9%), China / Asia Pacific (5%), and Channel Development (10%).Concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. Historical financial information presented herein reflects this change.AmericasAmericas operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. The Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale.Europe, Middle East, and AfricaEMEA operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Certain markets within EMEA operations are in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than Americas.China / Asia PacificChina /Asia Pacific operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Certain markets within China / Asia Pacific operations are in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than Americas.Channel DevelopmentChannel Development operations sell a selection of packaged coffees as well as a selection of premium Tazo® teas globally. Channel Development operations also produce and sell a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, Starbucks® coffee and Tazo® tea K-Cup® portion packs, Starbucks® ice creams, and Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages. The US foodservice business, which is included in the Channel Development segment, sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies.OtherOther includes Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Digital Ventures, and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment, and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.86Table of ContentsRevenue mix by product type (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Beverage$7,838.8 59% $7,217.0 62% $6,750.3 63%Food2,092.8 16% 2,008.0 17% 1,878.7 18%Packaged and single serve coffees 2,001.1 15% 1,451.0 12% 1,131.3 10%Other(1)1,366.8 10% 1,024.4 9% 947.1 9%Total$13,299.5 100% $11,700.4 100% $10,707.4 100%(1)Other includes royalty and licensing revenues, beverage-related ingredients, packaging and other merchandise.Information by geographic area (in millions):Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010Net revenues from external customers:     United States$10,177.5 $8,966.9 $8,335.4Other countries3,122.0 2,733.5 2,372.0Total$13,299.5 $11,700.4 $10,707.4No customer accounts for 10% or more of our revenues.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPSeattle, WashingtonNovember 16, 2012 89Table of ContentsItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNot applicable.Item 9A.Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 30, 2012).There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this 10-K.Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2012.Our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.90Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks CorporationSeattle, WashingtonWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPSeattle, WashingtonNovember 16, 2012 91Table of ContentsItem 9B.Other InformationOn November 13, 2012 the Starbucks Board of Directors approved an amendment to Article X of the Company's amended and restated bylaws (as amended, the “Amended Bylaws”) to read as follows:ARTICLE X.
