internationally, on various platforms, including the Internet, mobile devices and video-on-demand, among others. The Company is focused on utilizing interactive features to
deepen and broaden its relationship with audiences. The Company is also pursuing opportunities to diversify its revenue streams, including from retransmission consent fees from cable and satellite

        The
Company competes with many different entities and media in various markets worldwide. In addition to competition in each of its businesses, the Company competes for opportunities in
the entertainment business with other diversified international entertainment companies such as The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal Media, LLC, News Corporation, Time Warner Inc.,

 CBS CORP. BUSINESS SEGMENTS  
        Entertainment (52%, 53% and 54% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively) 
        The
Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network; CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution, the Company's television production
and syndication operations; CBS Films, the Company's producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures; and CBS Interactive, the Company's online content networks for information and
entertainment. 
         Television Network.    The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment, CBS News® and CBS Sports® distributes
a comprehensive schedule of news and
public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 16 of the Company's owned and operated television stations,
and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories. The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sales of advertising time for its network broadcasts. 
        CBS
Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and
drama series, reality-based programming, specials, children's programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the
CBS Television Network and the CBS Radio Network with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including 60
Minutes®, 48 Hours Mystery®, CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley,  CBS This Morning, CBS
Sunday Morning® and Face the
Nation® as well as special reports. CBS News off-network production units produce programming for domestic and international outlets, including the CBS
Television Network, cable television, home video, audio-book and in-flight markets, as well as schools and libraries. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a
television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts
include The NFL Today, certain games from the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament (including the NCAA Men's Final Four), the PGA Golf Tour,
Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, regular-season college football and basketball games on network television, in addition to the NFL's
American Football Conference (AFC) regular-season, post-season divisional playoff and championship games. CBS Sports has rights to broadcast the AFC through the 2013 season, including the
broadcast of the 2013 Super Bowl. In December 2011, CBS extended its rights with the NFL to broadcast the AFC from the 2014 season through the 2022 season, including certain National Football
Conference regular season games and the Super Bowls in 2016, 2019 and 2022. CBS Home Entertainment licenses home video rights and CBS Consumer Products licenses merchandising rights. 
        The
CW, a broadcast network and the Company's 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, was launched in Fall 2006. The CW's programming includes Gossip
Girl, 90210, The Vampire Diaries and America's Next Top Model. Nine of the
Company's owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. In 2011, license agreements were entered into with each of Hulu, LLC and Netflix, Inc. to permit the streaming of certain of
The CW's programming. 
         Television Production and Syndication.    The Company, through CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television
Distribution,
produces, acquires and/or distributes programming 
I-2



 

worldwide,
including series, specials, news and public affairs. Such programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services
or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The
Company
also distributes off-network syndicated programming, which is programming exhibited on television stations, cable networks or video-on-demand services following its
exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service. 
        Programming
that was produced or co-produced by the Company's production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others, CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation (CBS), NCIS (CBS), The Good Wife (CBS) and  90210 (The CW).
Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period.
Remaining distribution rights, including foreign and/or off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution
rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or foreign markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the
Company's objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through international and domestic syndication of episodes. International sales are generally made within one year of U.S. network run.
Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series such
as CSI:, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Criminal Minds, NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles as well as a library of older
television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside
Edition, The Insider, Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray and Judge Judy. The Company
also distributes syndicated and other programming internationally. The Company has entered into agreements for digital streaming of its programming in the U.S. and certain other countries. The Company
entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with Netflix, Inc., for streaming various programming from the Company's library on Netflix's subscription
video-on-demand services in July 2011 for Canada and Latin America and, in October 2011, for the U.K. In September 2011, the Company entered into a non-exclusive
licensing agreement with Hulu Japan LLC for streaming various programs from the Company's library on Hulu's subscription video-on-demand service in Japan. In February
2011 and July 2011, the Company entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with each of Netflix, Inc. and Amazon Digital Services, Inc., respectively, to stream various
programs from the Company's library on each of Netflix's and Amazon's subscription video-on-demand services in the U.S. 
        License
fees for completed television programming in syndication, on cable and video-on-demand and digitally streamed are recorded as revenues in the period that
the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in the Entertainment segment's operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such
license agreements were approximately $1.25 billion and $654 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. 
        The
Company continues to expand its global channel presence through international joint ventures. The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Reliance Broadcast Network
Limited which operates three English language and one Punjabi language general entertainment television channels customized for the Indian market and surrounding territory, the first of which,  BIG CBS
Prime, launched in November 2010, followed by the launches in 2011 of each of BIG CBS
Love and BIG CBS Spark and the launch in 2012 of BIG CBS Spark
Punjabi. Also, the Company owns an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Ten Network Holdings Limited to provide content to  ELEVEN, a
digital multichannel service which launched in Australia in January 2011.
In addition, the Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Chellozone (UK) Limited, a subsidiary of Liberty Global, Inc., which owns and operates six television channels in the U.K.
and Ireland, including CBS Action, CBS Drama and CBS
Reality; and an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture, which owns two pay television channels in Australia called  TV1 and Sci
Fi.

         CBS Films.    CBS Films produces, acquires and distributes theatrical motion pictures across all genres. The budget for each
picture is intended to be
up to $50 million plus advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide,
commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS Films' theatrical releases in 2011 were The
Mechanic and Beastly. Theatrical releases in 2012 include The Woman in Black,  Salmon Fishing in the
Yemen, and 7500. 
        In
general, motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films are exhibited theatrically in the U.S. and internationally, followed by exploitation via home entertainment (including DVD
and electronic rental and sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and basic cable, digital media
outlets and, in some cases, other channels such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films will exploit its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights, such as licensing and merchandising) and
generate revenues in all media in the relevant release windows either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third party distribution arrangements. 
         CBS Interactive.    CBS Interactive operates one of the leading global publishers of premium content on the Internet. CBS
Interactive was ranked among
the top Internet properties in the world according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2011. CBS Interactive's leading brands, including CNET,  CBS.com,
CBSSports.com, GameSpot,  TV.com, CBSNews.com, ZDNet, Last.fm, and MetroLyrics.com, among others, serve targeted audiences with
text, video, audio, and mobile content spanning technology, entertainment, sports, news, business, gaming and music categories. In addition to its U.S.-based business, CBS Interactive operates in Asia
and Europe. CBS Interactive's worldwide brands reached approximately 246 million unique monthly visitors during December 2011 according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2011. 
        CBS
Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions,
e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online
marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year. 
        CNET.com is one of the preeminent Websites for technology and consumer electronics information and features news, reviews, downloads and
instructional and entertaining video and audio shows about technology. GameSpot is a leading gaming information Website providing video game reviews and
previews, news, Webcasts, videos, and game downloads. CBSSports.com provides sports content, fantasy sports, community and e-commerce
features. CBSSports.com owns and operates CBSCollegeSports.com College Network and  MaxPreps.com.
TV.com is a destination for entertainment and community around television where visitors
can watch videos and discuss and obtain information about television shows across all networks. CBS Interactive also operates CBS.com, the online
destination for CBS Television Network programming. Through the CBS Audience Network, the Company delivers content from its Websites and
television, radio and affiliated stations, in connection with new and existing advertiser-supported deals. The growing slate of CBS entertainment, news and sports content available online includes
full episodes, clips and highlights based on CBS and Showtime Networks programming as well as original made-for-the-Web content. CBS Interactive Music Group
operates Last.fm, a music discovery and social networking site, and MetroLyrics.com, a top song lyrics
online database acquired by the Company in October 2011. 

 Entertainment Competition.  

         Television Network.    The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in
broadcast television are the
development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like
CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, 
I-4



 
independent
television stations, cable program services as well as other media, including DVDs, print and the Internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast
networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a
nationwide audience. According to Nielsen Media Research, for the broadcast television primetime daypart for the period September 19, 2011 to February 5, 2012, the CBS Television Network
secured the #1 position for total
viewers and for key adult viewers ages 25-54 and the #2 position for key adult viewers ages 18-49. 
         Television Production and Syndication.    As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios,
television production groups,
and independent producers and syndicators such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros. to produce and sell programming both domestically and overseas. The Company also competes to obtain
creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses. 
        CBS Films.    Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development
and production of a
motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the rights to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on screen performers and other creative
personnel. Once a motion picture is completed, CBS Films must compete with numerous other motion pictures produced by various studios and independent producers including Paramount Pictures
Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, The Weinstein Company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore
Entertainment Group LLC, among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many
options for entertainment other than motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the Internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities. 
         CBS Interactive.    CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including
the following: general
purpose portals such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!, especially as these properties expand their content offerings; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and MSN; online comparison shopping and retail
properties, including Shopping.com, Amazon.com and eBay; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive's brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, and
lifestyle focused Websites; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both
online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers. 
        Cable Networks (11%, 10% and 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) 
        The
Cable Networks segment is composed of Showtime Networks, the Company's premium subscription program services;  CBS Sports Network, the Company's cable
network devoted to college athletics; and Smithsonian Networks,
a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel. 
         Showtime Networks.    Showtime Networks owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription program services in the U.S.:
 Showtime, offering recently released theatrical feature films, original series, documentaries, boxing, mixed martial arts and other sports-related
programming, and special events; The Movie Channel®, offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and  Flix®,
offering theatrical feature films primarily from the last several decades, as well as selected other titles. At December 31,
2011, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had approximately 73 million
subscriptions in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda. 
        Showtime
Networks also owns and operates multiplexed channels of Showtime and The Movie
Channel in the U.S. which offer additional and varied programming choices. In addition, Showtime Networks 
I-5



 

transmits
high definition feeds of Showtime, The Movie Channel and many of their multiplexed channels, and also makes versions of  Showtime, The Movie Channel and
Flix available "on demand," enabling subscribers to watch selected
individual programs at their convenience (in both standard and high definition in the case of Showtime and The Movie
Channel, and standard definition in the case of Flix). Showtime Networks also makes available Showtime
Anytime®, a streaming on-demand authenticated version of Showtime, which can be accessed on computers
via showtimeanytime.com or through an iPad® application free of charge to  Showtime subscribers as part
of their Showtime subscription through participating Showtime Networks'
distributors. Showtime Networks additionally operates the Website SHO.com and various mobile applications which promote  Showtime, The Movie Channel and
Flix programming, and provide information and entertainment and other
services. 
        Showtime
Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous cable, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), telephone company ("telco"), and other
distributors, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are
the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for  Showtime and The Movie
Channel, from major or independent motion picture producers and other
distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations. For example, in addition to a motion picture output agreement with CBS Films, Showtime Networks has entered into motion
picture output agreements with Buena Vista Pay Television, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, for certain DreamWorks motion pictures, The Weinstein Company and Summit Entertainment for the
exclusive U.S. premium subscription television rights for certain exhibition windows relating to feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S through December 2015 and, in the case of
Summit Entertainment, December 2012. Showtime Networks' original series include Dexter®,  Homeland, Shameless, Weeds, The
Borgias, Nurse Jackie, The Big C, Californication, House of Lies and Episodes,
among others. Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce
the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. For example,
Showtime Networks and its corporate affiliate(s) have
entered into licenses with television networks in various territories for exhibition of certain original series, as well as electronic sell-through arrangements with several Internet
distributors, including iTunes and Amazon, among others, for certain Showtime programming. Showtime Networks also produces and/or provides special
events to licensees on a pay-per-view basis through Showtime PPV®.
        Showtime
Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian
Channel, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks has launched both standard and
high definition versions of Smithsonian Channel, as well as of its companion on demand version. 
         CBS Sports Network.    CBS Sports Network is a 24-hour cable program service that provides sports and related content, with a
strong focus
on college sports. The network features events from approximately 20 men's and women's sports and provides coverage of over 300 live events each year in addition to live studio shows and original
programming. CBS Sports Network had approximately 44 million subscribers as of December 31, 2011. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising on
its cable program service. CBS Sports Network has secured favorable positioning with four of the top five cable, DBS, telco and other distributors. CBS Sports Network and Comcast Corporation each owns
a 50% interest in the mtn: MountainWest Sports Network, which exhibits Mountain West Conference athletics and is available to U.S. cable and satellite
providers. 
I-6



 

 Cable Networks Competition.  

         Showtime Networks.    Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the
U.S.: Home Box
Office, Inc. and Starz Entertainment, LLC. Competition among premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of
original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices,
marketing and advertising support and other incentives to cable, DBS, telco
and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks' premium subscription program services to subscribers. Home Box Office, Inc. is the dominant
company in the U.S. premium subscription program service category, offering two premium subscription program services, HBO and Cinemax. Showtime Networks competes with Home Box Office, Inc. and
has a smaller share of the premium subscription program service category. Starz Entertainment, LLC owns Starz, another premium subscription program service, which competes with Showtime
Networks' and Home Box Office, Inc.'s premium program services. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with broadcast television, basic cable program
services and other media, including DVDs, portable devices and the Internet. 
        The
terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company's subscription program services are important to the Company. Consolidation among
multichannel video programming distributors and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach favorable terms and could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, new entrants, such
as Netflix, Inc., providing programming or other services for cable and/or other platforms, including the Internet, are or could be competitive with and adversely affect the Company's media
businesses, including Showtime Networks' subscription program service business. 
        Smithsonian
Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non-fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National
Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media, such as DVDs, portable devices and the Internet. 
         CBS Sports Network.    CBS Sports Network' principally competes with other sports-oriented cable programming services for
distribution and license fee
revenue among cable, DBS, telco and other distributors, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. Consolidation among cable operators has made it more difficult for newer channels to secure
broad distribution. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for newer sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration
or acceptance. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions may adversely impact CBS Sports Network's programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also
competes with other sports programming services, such as ESPN, NBC Sports Network and the FOX Sports Networks, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in
increased rights fees and increased production expenses. 
        Publishing (6% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009) 
        The
Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books in the U.S. and internationally. 
I-7




 











        Simon & Schuster publishes and distributes adult and children's consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats in the U.S. and internationally. Digital formats include audio
downloads for the Apple iPod and other companies' MP3 players, electronic books for increasingly popular devices such as Amazon's Kindle, the Apple iPad and Barnes & Noble's NOOK, stand-alone
applications for the Apple iPod and iPhone, and new hybrid text and video combinations. Simon & Schuster's major adult imprints include Simon &
Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Atria Books®, Gallery
Books, Touchstone® and Free Press. Simon &
Schuster's major children's imprints include Simon Pulse®, Aladdin® and Simon & Schuster Books
For Young Readers. Simon & Schuster also develops special imprints and publishes titles based on the products of certain CBS businesses as well as that of
third parties and distributes products for other publishers. Simon & Schuster distributes its products directly and through third parties. Simon & Schuster also delivers content and
promotes its products on general Internet sites as well as those linked to individual titles; its created assets include online videos showcasing Simon & Schuster authors and new releases on
YouTube, Facebook, MSN.com, SimonandSchuster.com and other sites. International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster UK,
Simon & Schuster Canada, Simon & Schuster Australia, Simon & Schuster India and other distributors, as well as the publication of local titles by Simon & Schuster UK and
Simon & Schuster Australia. 
        In
2011, Simon & Schuster published 233 New York Times bestsellers in hardcover, paperback and electronic formats, collectively, including 29 New York Times #1 bestsellers.
Best-selling titles in 2011 include Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, A Stolen Life by Jaycee
Dugard and 11/22/63 by Stephen King. Bestselling children's titles from Simon & Schuster include City of Fallen
Angels by Cassandra Clare, Dork Diaries 3 by Rachel Renee Russell, and World Without
Heroes by Brandon Mull. Simon & Schuster Digital, through  SimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds
reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster's books over the Internet. 
        The
consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title
releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster's sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster's top five accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer
print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local
economic conditions. In 2011, the sale of digital content represented approximately 17% of Simon & Schuster's revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will represent an increasing
portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years. 
        Publishing Competition.    The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation
trends and new
electronic distribution methods and models. Mass merchandisers and on-line retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the
retail channel. The growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers and could result in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of the
Company's books. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions and competition may adversely affect book retailers' operations, including distribution of the Company's books. The Company must compete
with other larger publishers such as Random House, Penguin Group, Hachette and Harper Collins for the rights to works by authors. Competition is particularly strong for well-known authors
and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self-publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution
models in which the Company's books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non-book content. In recent years, the Company has experienced price
pressure on new releases, for both printed and electronic formats, as a result of price competition among book retailers. In 2010, Simon & Schuster began to enter into agency arrangements with
book retailers and wholesalers under which Simon & Schuster sells its electronic books directly to the consumer and sets the consumer price. The Company still faces price competition from
retailers and from competing publishers that sell directly to consumers.

        Local Broadcasting (19%, 20% and 18% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) 
        The
Local Broadcasting segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company's 29 owned broadcast television stations, and CBS Radio, through which the Company owns and operates
130 radio stations in 28 U.S. markets and related online properties. The Company operates local Websites in major U.S. markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas,
which combine the Company's television and radio local media brands online to provide the latest news,
traffic, weather, and sports information as well as local discounts, directories and reviews to serve the local community. 
         CBS Television Stations.    The Company owns 29 broadcast television stations through its CBS Television Stations group, all of
which operate under
licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The
Company's television stations are located in the 7 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area
("DMA") in 9 major markets. These multiple station markets are: Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose
(market #6), Boston (market #7), Detroit (market #11), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #23). The Company has entered
into an agreement to purchase independent Long Island, New York station, WLNY-TV, which is subject to customary closing conditions. This acquisition would result in New York (market #1)
also being a multiple television station market. This group of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The
stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming. The CBS
Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. Substantially all of the Company's television stations operate Websites, many
of which are combined with the Websites of the Company's radio stations in co-located markets, which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as
well as other services. These Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising.

         CBS Radio.    The Company's radio broadcasting business operates through CBS Radio, one of the largest operators of radio stations
in the U.S. CBS Radio
owns and operates 130 radio stations serving 28 U.S. markets as of February 21, 2012. In January 2012, the Company acquired an additional radio station in the Washington, D.C. market. Virtually
all of the Company's owned and operated radio stations are located in the 50 largest U.S. radio markets and approximately 75% in the 25 largest U.S. radio markets. Most of the Company's owned radio
stations implement digital broadcasting. The Company's strategy generally is to operate radio stations in the largest markets and take advantage of the Company's ability to sell advertising across
multiple markets and formats. The Company believes that it is favorably impacted by offering radio, television and outdoor advertising platforms in large markets. The "Radio Stations, Television
Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table below includes information with respect to the Company's radio stations in the top 25 U.S. radio markets. 
        CBS
Radio's geographically dispersed stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of formats such as rock, classic hits/oldies, all-news, talk, Spanish
language, adult contemporary, top 40/contemporary hit radio, urban, sports and country, and CBS Radio has established leading franchises in news, sports and personality programming. This diversity
provides advertisers with the convenience of selecting stations to reach a targeted demographic or of selecting groups of stations to reach broad groups of consumers within and across markets and also
reduces the Company's dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser. At the same time, CBS Radio maintains substantial diversity in each market where its stations operate so
that its stations can appeal to several demographic groups. CBS Radio's general programming strategies include employing popular on-air talent, some of whose broadcasts may be syndicated
by CBS Radio using the services of a third party syndicator, broadcasting programming syndicated to it by others, acquiring the rights to broadcast sports play-by-play and
producing and acquiring news content for its radio stations. The overall mix of each radio station's programming lineup is designed to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community. 
        The
majority of CBS Radio's revenues are generated from the sale of local and national advertising. The major categories of radio advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare,
telecommunications, fast food, beverage, movies and entertainment. CBS Radio is able to use the reach, diversity and branding of its radio stations to create unique division-wide marketing
and promotional initiatives for major national advertisers of products and services. Advertising expenditures by local advertisers fluctuate, which has an effect on CBS Radio's revenues. 
        Substantially
all of the Company's radio stations operate Websites, many of which are combined with the Websites of the Company's television stations in co-located markets,
which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. Also, CBS Radio operates Websites for its music radio stations. All of these
Websites principally derive revenues from 
I-11



 

the
sale of advertising. CBS Radio is one of the most listened to online radio providers according to Triton Digital's monthly Top 20 Ranker for December 2011. 

 Local Broadcasting Competition.  

         CBS Television Stations.    Television stations compete for programming, on-air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with
other
stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local
and national media. The owned and operated television stations' competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not
programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late
evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal. 
         CBS Radio.    The Company's radio stations directly compete within their respective markets for audience, advertising revenues and
programming with
other radio stations, including those owned by other group owners such as Clear Channel Communications, Inc., Cumulus Media Inc., Emmis Communications Corporation, Entercom
Communications Corp. and Radio One, Inc. The Company's radio stations, including its Internet and streaming activities, also compete with other media, such as broadcast, cable and DBS
television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and the Internet, including services such as
Pandora, Spotify and Rhapsody. The radio industry is also subject to competition from Sirius XM Radio Inc., which provides digital audio services to subscribers. 
        The
Company's television and radio stations face increasing competition from newer technologies, including audio and visual programming delivered via the Internet, which create new ways
for individuals to watch programming and listen to music and other content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements. Also, an increasingly broad adoption by consumers of
portable digital devices could affect the ability of the Company's television and radio stations to attract audiences and advertisers. 
        Aggregate
total revenues for the Company's radio stations for 2011 were ranked #1 or #2 in the top five U.S. markets by metro area population (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San
Francisco, and Dallas-Fort Worth), according to the 2011 Market Total Revenues Performance Summary of Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP.

(2)As
required by the FCC, the Company assigned KFWB-AM to a divestiture trust. The Company is a beneficiary of the trust. The trustee is operating
the radio station and is responsible for selling the radio station to a third party. (See "CBS Business SegmentsRegulationBroadcastingOwnership
RegulationRadio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule").

of New York City. The Company's New York City radio and television stations serve Nassau-Suffolk. 

        Outdoor (13% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009) 
        The
Company sells, through its Outdoor businesses, advertising space on various media, including billboards, transit shelters and other street furniture, buses, rail systems
(in-car, station platform and terminal), mall kiosks and stadium signage and in retail stores. It has outdoor advertising operations in more than 100 markets in North America,
including all 50 of the largest metropolitan markets in the U.S., 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all 45 of the largest metropolitan markets in
Mexico. Additionally, Outdoor has the exclusive rights to manage advertising space on approximately 90% of the total bus fleet in the U.K. and has a variety of outdoor advertising displays in the
Netherlands, France, Italy, Puerto Rico, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and China. The Company operates its Outdoor businesses through CBS
Outdoor in the U.S., Canada, South America and Europe, CBS Outernet® in the U.S. and  Vendor® in Mexico. The "Radio Stations,
 Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays"
table above includes information with regard to the Company's outdoor advertising properties in the top 25 U.S. radio markets. 
        The
substantial majority of Outdoor's revenues is generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. Advertising rates for a particular display are based on supply and
demand, which are influenced by the display's exposure known as "impressions", the demographics of the particular market and the location of the display within that market. Until recently, these
impressions were not measured by independent third parties. Commencing in January 2011, metrics for fixed displays such as billboards and street furniture, including demographic information and
audience views, are measured through the new "Eyes On" technology administered by the Traffic Audit Bureau, an independent agency formed by a number of major outdoor advertising vendors, including CBS
Outdoor, advertising agencies and advertisers. These metrics facilitate the inclusion of Outdoor's inventory in the planning stages of media campaigns. The major categories of
out-of-home advertisers include: entertainment, media, automotive, beverage, financial, real estate, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, restaurants, health and beauty
aids, hotels and professional services. Out-of-home media industry advertising expenditures by retailers and the entertainment industry fluctuate, which has an effect on
Outdoor's revenues. 
        Outdoor
generally operates in the billboard, transit, street furniture and retail store advertising markets. Outdoor primarily operates two types of billboard advertising displays,
commonly referred to as "bulletins" and "posters." 
        Billboard
space is generally sold for periods ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. Billboards are generally mounted on structures owned by Outdoor located on leased real
property. Lease agreements are negotiated with both public and private landowners for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to year-to-year, can be
for terms of 10 years or longer and may provide for renewal options. There is no significant concentration of billboards under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord. 
I-15




 










        Transit advertising includes advertising on or in transit systems, including the interiors and exteriors of buses, trains and trams and at rail stations. Transit advertising contracts
are negotiated with public transit authorities and private transit operators and generally provide for payment to the transit authority of a percentage of the revenues, a fixed payment, or the greater
of a percentage of the revenues or a fixed payment. Where revenues are lower than anticipated, the minimum amount required to be paid to a transit authority may exceed, or be a high percentage of, the
net advertising revenues received by Outdoor under that advertising contract. Due to the challenging advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground
contract, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels. 
        Street
furniture displays, the most common of which are bus shelters, reach both vehicular and pedestrian audiences. Bus shelters are usually constructed, installed and maintained by
Outdoor. Most of Outdoor's bus shelter contracts include revenue-sharing arrangements with a municipality or transit authority and often include minimum required payments. Street furniture contracts
usually involve a competitive bidding process. Contracts are awarded on the basis of projected revenues to the municipality, including minimum payments, and Outdoor's willingness to construct public
facilities, such as bus shelters, public toilets and information kiosks. In both its transit and street furniture negotiations, Outdoor seeks to reduce minimum payment obligations on new agreements
and on renewal of existing agreements. There is no assurance that Outdoor will be successful in reducing its minimum payments, entering into new agreements or renewing certain existing agreements and
any such agreements may provide a lesser return to the Company. 
        Newer
technologies for outdoor advertising displays, such as changeable message displays and digital billboards using light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display technology, continue
to evolve. The Company keeps apprised of and has adopted such new technologies as they evolve and mature. For
example, Outdoor is utilizing digital technology containing moving images in the London Underground, New York City subways and in retail outlets through CBS Outernet. Outdoor is also building new
digital billboards and digitizing the displays on previously static billboards. CBS Outernet, a leading distributor of video programming and advertising content to retail stores, enables customized
messaging by region and retail environment. Generally, CBS Outernet enters into revenue-sharing arrangements with retailers based on advertising sales. 
        Outdoor's
business strategy involves expanding its presence in major selected markets, to grow its revenues and cash flow by being a leading provider of
out-of-home advertising services in the markets it serves, controlling costs, developing and entering into new markets and using advanced technologies to build greater
awareness and promote tactical advertising. In addition, the Company purchases outdoor advertising assets within its existing markets or in contiguous markets. The Company believes that there will be
continuing opportunities for implementing its acquisition and development strategies given the outdoor advertising industry's fragmentation. This is particularly true in the international markets
where there are opportunities for Outdoor to increase profitability both from acquiring additional assets in or near its existing operations and from future acquisitions in new markets. 
         Outdoor Competition.    The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor
advertising such as
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., JCDecaux S.A., Cemusa Inc., Titan Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company as well as hundreds of smaller regional and
local companies operating a limited number of display faces in a single or a few local markets. The Company also competes with other media, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print
media, the Internet and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, it competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in
shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media and cost-per-thousand impressions, particularly when
delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to
reach a broad segment in a specific market or to target a particular geographic area or population with a particular demographic within that market. The Company keeps 
I-16



 

apprised
of the evolution of new technologies in the industry. As new technologies such as digital billboards prove desirable to Outdoor's customers and deliver appropriate returns on investment, the
Company's costs could increase. 
        The
Company believes that its strong emphasis in sales and customer service and its position as a leading provider of advertising services in each of its primary markets as well as its
international inventory enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as other media, within those markets. 
 REGULATION  
        The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities. The
rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the
statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses. 

 Intellectual Property and Privacy  

        Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See "Intellectual Property" on
page I-22). 
         Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy.    Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material
over the
Internet and through physical devices without regard to content owners' copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs,
user-generated content, streaming, Internet downloads, file "sharing" and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit
their property. The Company is engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and has participated in various litigations and public relations programs and
legislative activity. In addition to these efforts, the Company continues to enter into and explore possibilities for commercial arrangements with various online providers to further protect and
exploit its content. 
         Copyright Law and Content.    In the U.S., the copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years. For works
made for
hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation. 
        Privacy.    The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving,
particularly
as they relate to the Company's interactive businesses. The
Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites and legal and regulatory compliance programs. 

 Broadcasting  

        General.    Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The
Communications Act
empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations' frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by
stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for
violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals. 
        Under
the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and DBS systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations. 
         Indecency and Profanity Regulation.    The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane
material between
the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the 
I-17



 

FCC's
indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC's maximum forfeiture penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane
programming is $325,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company
is and has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on
its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material. (See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionLegal
MattersIndecency Regulation" on page II-34). 
        License Renewals.    Radio and television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications
Act requires
the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations
by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations
that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has a number of pending renewal applications, nine of which have been opposed by third parties (there are two opposed renewal
applications for Radio and seven opposed renewal applications for Television Stations). 
         License Assignments.    The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an
FCC licensee.
Third parties may oppose the Company's applications to transfer or acquire additional broadcast licenses. 
         Ownership Regulation.    The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have an
official position
or ownership interest, known as an "attributable" interest, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition
of a broadcast radio or television station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the
public interest. 
        In
December 2007, the FCC concluded a proceeding which examined whether to modify its various ownership rules, but with the exception of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership
rule, the FCC declined to do so. In July 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the FCC's decision to refrain from modifying the various ownership rules and reinstated
the former newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban. In 2011, the FCC launched the latest quadrennial review of its ownership rules. It has proposed modifying the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership
rule and eliminating the radio-television cross-ownership rule. The FCC's current ownership rules are briefly summarized below. 


        Local Radio Ownership.    The FCC's local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations.
Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of
8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings. The Company's FM radio portfolio exceeds the FCC's numerical limit in one market, West Palm Beach, which is
grandfathered. While the rules do not require the divestiture of any existing radio ownership combinations, the Company is not permitted to transfer its radio portfolio in that market intact, except
to qualified small businesses. 
        Local Television Ownership.    Under the FCC's local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations
in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of
an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without
regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of
the stations involved do not overlap. Satellite 


I-18



 



television
stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a "parent" television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the "parent" station. 
        Television National Audience Reach Limitation.    Under the FCC's national television ownership rule, one party may not own
television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes a UHF
television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households
but for purposes of the national ownership limitation, the Company's reach is less than this amount applying the UHF discount in accordance with the FCC's methodology. 
        Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule.    The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and
television stations in the same market. The numeric limit varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company owns a combination of radio and television stations in
the Los Angeles market in excess of the limit. As required by the FCC, the Company assigned radio station KFWB-AM in Los Angeles to a divestiture trust. The Company is a beneficiary of the
trust. The trustee is operating the radio station and is responsible for selling the radio station to a third party, the closing of which would bring the Company into compliance with this
cross-ownership rule. 
        Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership.    The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the common ownership of a
broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same market absent a waiver by the FCC. 
        Dual Network Rule.    The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining. 


         Attribution of Ownership.    Under the FCC's attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various
types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an "attributable"
interest in other media properties. Under the FCC's rules, an "attributable" interest for purposes of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined
exceed 33% of a licensee's total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee's total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest,
whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in
which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly "insulated"
from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is reviewing its single majority voting shareholder attribution
exemption, which renders as non-attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting shareholder. Because NAI holds an attributable interest in both
the Company and Viacom Inc., the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic
business alternatives and business terms available to the Company. (See Item 1A. "Risk FactorsThe Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other
Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities"). 


        Alien Ownership.    In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 20% or
more than 25%, depending on the circumstances, of the voting power or equity of the Company. 


I-19



 
         Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations.    The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the
retransmission of
commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to
which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to
negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company has elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases for the period beginning January 1, 2009, and,
since 2006, has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent. 
        Similarly,
federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local
television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory
copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect "must carry" or "retransmission consent"
status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems. Substantially all of the Company's owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local
markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. 
         Children's Television Programming.    Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be
shown on
television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and
informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program
stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display
during children's programming of Internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. 
        Program Access.    Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally
prohibited from
offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's
regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules also limit the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. A cable
programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC's program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned by a cable operator in whole or in part. Cable operators for this purpose
may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers. 
        The
Company's wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage
of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and
Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.'s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC's program access rules. (See Item 1A. "Risk
FactorsThe Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities"). 
        National Broadband Plan.    In response to the FCC's March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband
access
throughout the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional
spectrum for wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC "repacks" the broadcast spectrum dedicated to broadcast
television use. The legislation provides that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas, no stations will be forced into the VHF band and a fund 
I-20



 

will
be established to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum-repacking. It is expected that the FCC auctions and repacking will involve multiple rule
making proceedings and may take several years. 

 Outdoor  

        The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and
to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations can affect the operation of advertising displays and include restrictions on the construction, repair, operation,
upgrading, height, size and location of outdoor advertising structures and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor
advertising is the subject of targeted state and municipal taxes and fees. These laws may affect competitive conditions in various markets in various ways. Such laws may reduce the Company's expansion
opportunities, or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from others. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations and the enforcement thereof will not materially and
adversely affect the Outdoor business. 
        Under
U.S. law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the "HBA"), outdoor advertising is controlled on primary and interstate highways built with federal financial
assistance. As a condition to federal highway assistance, the HBA requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas, and imposes certain additional size,
spacing and other requirements associated with the installation and operation of billboards. Outdoor is not aware of any states which have passed laws and adopted regulations which are less
restrictive than the federal requirements, including the obligation on the part of the billboard owner to remove, at the owner's expense and without compensation, any non-grandfathered
signs on such highways that do not comply with such requirements. Outdoor does not believe that the number of its billboards that may be subject to removal under these regulations is material. No
state in which Outdoor operates has banned billboards, but some have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign
controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. Some state and local governments prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures,
although most allow construction of billboards subject
to restrictions on zoning, size, spacing, height and type of construction. In some cases, the construction of new billboards or the relocation or modification of existing billboards is prohibited. A
number of cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Miami have implemented or initiated legislative billboard controls, including imposing taxes, fees and/or registration
requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. The Company contests such laws and regulations that it believes unlawfully restrict its
constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of its outdoor advertising business. 
        U.S.
law neither requires nor prohibits removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a
lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification objectives in
the past using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. State government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove
billboards. Thus far, Outdoor has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its billboards purchased or removed as a result of this type of governmental action, although there is no assurance
that this will continue to be the case in the future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification, but some have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming
billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations) after a period of years under a concept called
amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although there is some question as to the legality of
amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been upheld in some instances. Outdoor generally has been successful in negotiating settlements with 
I-21



 

municipalities
for billboards required to be removed. Restrictive regulations also limit Outdoor's ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards. 
        As
the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities in outdoor advertising operations, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign
environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. The Company and its properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of
hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety, as well as zoning and other land use restrictions which may affect, among other things, the type of display, such as
digital, tri-vision or static, the hours of operation and illumination as well as methods and conditions of maintenance of facilities and advertising installation. Historically, the
Company has not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, future laws or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws could require the Company to make
significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict its ability to use or operate some of its displays. 
        Certain
products, services and types of displays are or may be targeted by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, tobacco products have been banned from outdoor
advertising. In addition, state and local governments continue to initiate proposals designed to limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Legislation regulating alcohol-related advertising due to
content-related
restrictions could cause a reduction in Outdoor's direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor
advertising industry. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

    Item 1A.    Risk Factors.     
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
        This document, including "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," and
the documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain both historical and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of
historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Company's current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward-looking statements
generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases.
Similarly, statements that describe the Company's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the
actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. More information about these
risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth below. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors may be described in the Company's news releases and other filings made under the securities
laws. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that the Company does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this
document are only made as of the date of this document and the Company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
 RISK FACTORS  
        For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. The
factors described below are considered to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have
material adverse effects on the Company's future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate
results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 
 A Decline in Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company's Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in Any Given Period or in Specific Markets  
        The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and basic cable networks, television stations,
radio stations, outdoor media and syndicated programming and online properties. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic
market, particularly a major market such as Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, in which the Company owns and operates sizeable businesses, could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending
priorities. Disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and economic
uncertainty. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the
economy, including the automotive, financial and pharmaceutical segments, represent a significant portion of the Company's advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change
resulting in a reduction in these sectors' advertising expenditures may adversely affect the Company's revenue. Advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from the Company may also be affected
by a decline in audience ratings 
I-23



 

for
the Company's programming, the inability of the Company to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by new program channels and the proliferation of new
media formats, including the Internet and video-on-demand and the deployment of portable digital devices and new technologies which allow consumers to live stream and time
shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast-forward through advertisements. The Company's revenues from outdoor advertising also depend on the Company's continued
ability to obtain the right to use effective outdoor advertising space. Any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenues and results of operations. 
 The Company's Success and Profitability Are Dependent Upon Audience Acceptance of Its Content, Including Its Television and Radio Programs and Motion Pictures, Which Is
Difficult to Predict  
        Television, radio and motion picture content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived
from the production and distribution of a television or radio program or motion picture, and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property, depend primarily upon their acceptance by
the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television or radio program or motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs and motion
pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and
intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that the Company receives. The use of new ratings
technologies and measurements, and viewership on new
platforms or devices that are not equipped to measure ratings, could have an impact on the Company's program ratings. Poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending. For
example, there can be no assurance that any replacement programming on the Company's radio or television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability of previous programming. In
addition, the success of the Company's cable networks and Simon & Schuster is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its programming and publications, respectively. The theatrical
success of a motion picture, based in large part upon audience acceptance, is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales, licensing fees and
other exploitation during the various other distribution windows. Consequently, low public acceptance of the Company's content, including its television and radio programs, motion pictures and
publications, will have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. In addition, any decreased popularity of programming for which the Company has incurred significant commitments could
have an adverse effect on its profitability. Programming and talent commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate approximately $16.91 billion as of December 31, 2011, primarily
included $12.90 billion for sports programming rights, $3.22 billion relating to television, radio, film production and licensing and $796 million for talent contracts with
$7.89 billion of these amounts payable in and after 2017. A shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the Company has acquired rights, or in the
television and radio programming the Company expects to distribute, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time. 
 Failure by the Company to Obtain, Create and Retain the Rights Related to Popular Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company's Revenues  
        The Company's revenue from its television, radio, cable networks and motion picture business is partially dependent on the Company's
continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Moreover, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive
library of television programming. Generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. If the content of its
television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the Company's revenues could be adversely affected. The Company 
I-24



 

obtains
a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. For example, some of CBS Television Network's most widely viewed broadcasts, including the NCAA's Men's Final Four, golf's
Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, and NFL games, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the Company has negotiated with third parties. In addition, Showtime
Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights to certain programming for Showtime, The Movie
Channel and Flix from motion picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations, and CBS Radio acquires the broadcast
rights to syndicated shows and to various programs, such as sports events from third parties. CBS Films competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce motion pictures.
Competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the Company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with
the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the Company. The Company's failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect the Company's revenues. 
 The Company Must Respond to Rapid Changes in Technology, Content Creation, Services and Standards in Order to Remain Competitive  
        Video, telecommunications, radio and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly as are the
digital distribution models for books. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and
methods of delivery and storage, could have a negative effect on the Company's businesses. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television broadcasts and online delivery of programming
to televisions, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, satellite radio, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, Internet and mobile
distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, place-shifting of content from the home to portable devices on which content is viewable outside the home, and digital outdoor displays.
For example, devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-delayed basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip
advertisements, such as DVRs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of programming, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the
attractiveness of the Company's offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect its revenues. Also, the growing uses of user-generated content sites and live and stored video
streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the Company's businesses. In
addition, further increases in the use of digital devices which allow users to view or listen to content of their own choosing, in their own time and remote locations, while avoiding traditional
commercial advertisements or subscription payments, could adversely affect the Company's radio and television broadcasting advertising and subscription revenues. Cable providers and DBS operators are
developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the
division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences. More television options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined
audiences may gain an advantage over the Company for television advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to
enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the Internet to view on television monitors, which could diminish viewership of the Company's programming. Generally, changing consumer
behavior may impact the Company's traditional distribution methods, for example, by reducing viewership of its programming (including motion pictures), the demand for DVD product and/or the desire to
see motion pictures in theaters, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's revenues and profitability. Also, the impact of technological changes on traditional distributors of video
programming may adversely affect the Company's cable networks' ability to grow revenue. Anticipating and adapting to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploiting new sources of revenue from
these changes will affect the Company's ability to continue to increase its revenue. 
I-25



 

 Piracy of the Company's Programming and Other Content, Including Digital Piracy, May Decrease Revenue Received from the Exploitation of the Company's Programming and Other
Content and Adversely Affect Its Businesses and Profitability  
        Piracy of programming (including motion pictures), books and other copyrighted material is prevalent in many parts of the world and is
made easier by the availability of digital copies of content and technological advances allowing conversion of such programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitate the creation,
transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of the Company's content. Recent technological advances, which facilitate the streaming of programming via the Internet to television
screens, may increase piracy. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of programming has an adverse effect on the Company's businesses and profitability because these unauthorized actions reduce the
revenue that the Company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. In addition, if piracy were to increase, it would have an adverse effect on
the Company's businesses and profitability. Also, while legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate and present challenges for enforcement.
Failure of legal protections to evolve and enable enhanced enforcement efforts to combat piracy could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which
could negatively impact its value and further increase the Company's enforcement costs. 
 The Company's Operating Results Are Subject to Seasonal Variations and Other Factors  
        The Company's business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal
advertising patterns and seasonal influences on people's viewing, reading, attendance and listening habits. Typically, the Company's revenue from advertising increases in the fourth quarter,
Simon & Schuster generates a substantial portion of its revenues in the fourth quarter, and license fees for television programming and CBS Films' revenue from motion pictures are dependent on
the timing, mix, number and availability of the Company's television programming and motion pictures, as applicable. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from
advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and
may adversely affect operating results. 
 The Company's Businesses Operate in Highly Competitive Industries  
        The Company competes with other media companies for high quality content and attractive outdoor advertising space to achieve large
audiences and to generate advertising revenue. The Company also competes for distribution on various cable, DBS and other platforms. The Company's ability to attract audiences and advertisers and
obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular television programming and radio programming, motion pictures and books, as well as well-placed outdoor
advertising faces. In addition, the consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors and television service providers has made competition for audiences, advertising revenue, and distribution more
intense. In addition, consolidation among book retailers and the growth of on-line sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space
for the Company's publications and for the attention of consumers on-line. Competition for audiences and advertising comes from: broadcast television stations and networks; cable
television systems and networks; motion picture studios; the Internet; terrestrial and satellite radio and portable devices; outdoor advertisers; local, regional and national newspapers; direct mail;
and other communications and advertising media that operate in these markets. Other television and radio stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new
network may adopt a format to compete directly with the Company's stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. In book publishing, competition among
electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. Moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by
authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services. This competition 
I-26



 

could
result in lower ratings and advertising and subscription and other revenues or increased promotional and other expenses and, consequently, lower earnings and cash flow for the Company. The
Company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors, or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect the Company's Businesses and Customers  
        The U.S. and other countries where the Company operates have experienced slowdowns and volatilities in their economies. A downturn
could lead to lower consumer and business spending for the Company's products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and
other consumers of the Company's content offerings and services, reduce demands for the Company's products and services. In addition, in unfavorable economic environments, the Company's customers may
have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely
payments and continue operations, including distribution of the Company's content. The Company is unable to predict the duration and severity of
weakened economic conditions and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact the Company's businesses, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Volatility and Weakness in Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Credit Availability and Related Financing Costs for the Company  
        Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the
Company's ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of its debt could be adversely affected. Although the Company can currently access the bank and capital markets, there
is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for the Company. In addition, the Company's access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the Company's short-
and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in the Company's debt ratings, could adversely affect the
Company's ability to obtain cost-effective financing. 
 Increased Programming and Content Costs May Adversely Affect the Company's Profits  
        The Company produces and acquires programming (including motion pictures) and content and incurs costs for all types of creative
talent, including actors, authors, writers and producers as well as marketing and distribution. An increase in any of these costs may lead to decreased profitability. 
 Changes in Communications Laws or Other Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company's Business  
        The television and radio broadcasting and distribution industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations
issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For
example, the Company is required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate its radio and television stations. The Company cannot be assured that the FCC will approve its future renewal applications
or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of
the Company's licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues. The Company must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of its
television and radio stations and its television networks. FCC regulations prohibit the ownership of more than one of the top four networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, and limit the number of television
and radio stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned 
I-27



 

nationwide,
which could restrict the Company's ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require it to divest some television or radio stations. The U.S. Congress
and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the
operation and ownership of the Company's radio and television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require radio and
television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any restrictions on political advertising may adversely affect the Company's
advertising revenues. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions
affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect the Company's advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive
landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by the Company. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules
(currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by cable distribution systems) to all cable program services. The Company's ability to obtain the most favorable
terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. In response to the FCC's March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide
affordable broadband access throughout the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television
stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC "repacks" the broadcast
spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of the FCC's actions or their effect, if any, on the Company's broadcasting properties. Legislation
could be enacted, which could remove over-the-air broadcasters' existing exemption from payment of a performance royalty to record companies and performers of music which is
broadcast on radio stations and could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming for the Company. In addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations
governing competition and the Internet, including those affecting data privacy, may have an adverse impact on the Company's international businesses and Internet properties. The
Company is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations. 
 Vigorous Enforcement or Enhancement of FCC Indecency and Other Program Content Rules Against the Broadcast and Cable Industries Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company's
Businesses and Results of Operations  
        The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio
broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC's
indecency/profanity definition, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC vigorously enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. The FCC has found on a number of
occasions that the content of radio and television broadcasts has contained indecent material. In such instances, the FCC issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. Moreover, the
FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent "utterance," in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given
program as constituting a single violation. The fines for broadcasting indecent material are a maximum of $325,000 per utterance. If the FCC denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of
the Company's broadcast radio or television stations, the Company would lose its authority to operate the station. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as
such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC's
indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to the Company's ability to comply with the rules. Violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect the Company's
businesses and results of operations. Some policymakers support the 
I-28



 

extension
of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or
otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of the Company's cable content
could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels. 
 The Loss of Affiliation Agreements or Retransmission Agreements Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company's Results of Operations  
        The CBS Television Network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per
week. In return, the CBS Television Network's affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming. Loss of network affiliation agreements of the CBS Television Network
could adversely affect the Company's
results of operations by reducing the reach of the Company's programming and therefore its attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also
adversely affect the Company's results of operations. The non-renewal or termination of retransmission agreements with cable, DBS and other distributors or continued distribution on less
favorable terms, could also adversely affect the Company's ability to distribute its network programming to a nationwide audience and affect the Company's ability to sell advertising, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Showtime Networks and the CBS Sports Network are also dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with cable, DBS and
other distributors, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such programmers. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could
reduce the distribution of Showtime Networks' and CBS Sports Network's program services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable
packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. Also, consolidation among cable and DBS distributors and increased
vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the Company's ability to maintain or
obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 The Failure or Destruction of Satellites, Transmitter Facilities and Network and Information Systems and Other Technology that the Company Depends Upon to Distribute Its
Programming and Operate Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company's Businesses and Results of Operations  
        The Company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. The distribution facilities include
uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as
a result of an impairment of a satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, the Company may not
be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. Failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
businesses and results of operations. Each of the Company's television and radio stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. Failure
to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses and results of operations. In addition, network and information systems and other
technologies are important to the Company's business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software,
process breakdowns or malicious or other activities could result in a disruption of the Company's services and operations or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which
could damage the Company's reputation and require the Company to expend resources to remedy any such breaches. The occurrence of any of such network or 
I-29



 

information
systems-related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. 
 The Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets, FCC Licenses and Programming  
        The Company will test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. A downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets,
including FCC licenses, could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Also, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the programming for which the
Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of such assets. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's reported net earnings. 
 Dividends and Dividend Rates Cannot Be Guaranteed  
        The Company's Board of Directors assesses relevant factors when considering the declaration of a dividend on the Company's common
stock. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to declare dividends, including at the same or similar rates. 
 The Loss of Key Personnel, Including Talent, Could Disrupt the Management or Operations of the Company's Business and Adversely Affect Its Revenues  
        The Company's business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its chief executive officer and other key
employees and entertainment personalities. The Company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace, and that the
loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the impairment of the Company's ability to execute its business strategy. While the Company does not
maintain a written succession plan with respect to Chairman of the Board, in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, designated independent committees of the CBS Board together
periodically review succession planning for the position of Chairman and report to the non-management directors of the CBS Board. Because 79% of the voting shares are controlled by Sumner
Redstone there can be no assurance now or in the future that he or the successors to the voting control may not seek to effect succession of the Chairman; however, and in all cases, the Board will
elect the next Chairman by a majority vote of the Board. Additionally, the Company employs or independently contracts with several entertainment personalities and authors with significant loyal
audiences or readership. Entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a television or radio station and, therefore, the ability of the station to sell
advertising, and an author's popularity can be significantly responsible for the success of a particular book. Cable Networks produces programming and CBS Films produces motion pictures with highly
regarded directors, actors and other talent who are important to
achieving audience endorsement of their content. There can be no assurance that these entertainment personalities, authors and talent will remain with or be drawn to the Company or will retain their
current audiences or readership. If the Company fails to retain or attract these entertainment personalities, authors and talent or they lose their current audiences or readership, the Company's
revenues could be adversely affected. 
I-30




 










 Regulation of the Outdoor Advertising Industry Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company's Outdoor Business  
        The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation and enforcement at the federal, state and local levels
in the U.S. and to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations and enforcement actions can affect the operation and continuance of operations of advertising
displays and include restrictions on the construction, operation, repair, upgrading, height, size, location and type, such as digital, tri-vision or static, of outdoor advertising
structures and displays and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor advertising is the subject of targeted state and
municipal taxes and fees. Such laws may increase the Company's costs and reduce the Company's expansion opportunities or may increase competitive pressure from others. The Company cannot give any
assurance that existing or future laws or regulations will not materially and adversely affect its outdoor business. 
 Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company's Results of Operations  
        Certain of the Company's revenues are earned and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates
relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. 
 The Company's Liabilities Related to Discontinued Operations and Former Businesses Could Adversely Impact Its Financial Condition  
        The Company has both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain
of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities,
contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. The Company cannot be assured that its reserves are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these
liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, operating performance or cash flow. 
 The Company Could Be Adversely Affected by Strikes and Other Union Activity  
        The Company and its suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are
subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company or its suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take
action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect the Company's television, radio,
cable networks, interactive and motion picture businesses by disrupting the Company's ability to provide scheduled services and programming or by causing delays in the production of the Company's
television or radio programming, motion pictures or the Company's outdoor business by disrupting its ability to place advertising on outdoor faces. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or
work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or the timing thereof. 
 Political and Economic Risks Associated with the Company's International Businesses Could Harm the Company's Financial Condition or Results of Operations  
        The Company's businesses operate and have customers worldwide. Inherent risks of doing business in international markets include, among
other risks, changes in the economic environment, export restrictions, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers and longer payment cycles. The Company

incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic environment in the regions where it does business. In addition, acts of terrorism or
other hostilities, or other future financial, political, economic or other uncertainties, could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures, which could materially adversely affect the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 NAI, Through Its Voting Control of the Company, Is in a Position to Control Actions that Require Stockholder Approval  
        NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company's Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company.
Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Executive Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, and
Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of NAI and serves as a
director of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require stockholder approval, including the election of directors and transactions involving a change of
control. Other stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of the corporate actions of the Company for so long as NAI retains voting control. 
 Sales of Shares of Common Stock by NAI Could Adversely Affect the Stock Price  
        NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company's Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. Based
on information received from NAI, shares of the Company's voting Class A common stock and non-voting Class B common stock owned by NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC ("NAI
EH"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAI, are pledged to NAI EH's lenders. NAI holds more than 50% of the Company's voting Class A shares directly and these shares are not pledged. If NAI EH
defaults on its obligations and the lenders
foreclose on the collateral, the lenders or anyone to whom the lenders transfer the Company's shares could sell such shares or convert those shares of voting Class A Common Stock into shares of
non-voting Class B Common Stock and sell such shares, which could adversely affect the Company's share price. Additionally, if the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares of voting
Class A Common Stock, NAI will no longer directly or indirectly own those shares and such lenders or other transferees would have voting rights in the Company. In addition, there can be no
assurance that NAI or NAI EH at some future time will not sell or pledge additional shares of the Company's stock, which could adversely affect the Company's share price. 
 Many Factors May Cause the Stock Price of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to Fluctuate  
        The stock price of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors.
These factors, some or all of which are beyond the Company's control, include: 


actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's operating results;   
changes in expectations as to the Company's future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities
analysts;   
success of the Company's operating and growth strategies;   
investor anticipation of strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events;  
operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and   
realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors. 

I-32



 
In
addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of the Company's common stock, regardless of the Company's actual operating performance. 
 The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities  
        So long as the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control, each company's businesses, as well as the businesses of any
other commonly controlled company, will be attributable to the other company for purposes of certain rules and regulations of the FCC and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in
the U.S., among others potentially. The businesses of one company will continue to be attributable to the other company for certain FCC purposes even after the two companies cease to be commonly
controlled, if the two companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of Viacom Inc. may have the effect of limiting and
affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company, including limitations to which the Company contractually agreed in connection with the Company's
separation of former Viacom Inc. ("Former Viacom") into two publicly traded entities, CBS Corporation and new Viacom Inc., which was completed on December 31, 2005 (the
"Separation"). 
 In Connection with the Separation, Each Company Will Rely on the Other Company's Performance Under Various Agreements Between the Companies  
        In connection with the Separation, the Company and Viacom Inc. entered into various agreements, including the Separation
Agreement, a tax matters agreement dated December 30, 2005, which is filed as an exhibit to this report, effective as of the Separation (the "Tax Matters Agreement") and certain related party
arrangements pursuant to which the Company and Viacom Inc. will provide services and products to each other from and after the Separation. The Separation Agreement sets forth the allocation of
assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the Company and Viacom Inc. following the Separation, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition,
pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, certain income tax
liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations are assumed by, each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Each company will rely on the other to
satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by the Company or Viacom Inc. under these agreements are legal or
contractual liabilities of the other company. If Viacom Inc. were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its
indemnification obligations, the Company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses. 
 Certain Members of Management, Directors and Stockholders May Face Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest  
        The management and directors of the Company may own both CBS Corp. common stock and Viacom Inc. common stock, and both the
Company and Viacom Inc. are controlled by NAI. Mr. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Executive
Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and executive chairman of Viacom Inc.'s board of directors. Ms. Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the
Board of Directors of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of NAI and serves as a director of the Company. Mr. Frederic V. Salerno is a director
of Viacom Inc. and serves as a director of the Company. This ownership overlap and these common directors could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the Company's
and Viacom Inc.'s management, directors and controlling stockholder face decisions that could have different implications for the Company and Viacom Inc. For example, potential conflicts
of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any 
I-33



 

dispute
between the Company and Viacom Inc. regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship between the Company and Viacom Inc. thereafter. These
agreements include, among others, the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. On occasion, the Company and
Viacom Inc. may compete with each other in various commercial enterprises. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if the Company and Viacom Inc. enter into any commercial
arrangements with each other in the future. Each of Mr. Redstone and Ms. Redstone may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his or her time between the Company
and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.'s certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both the Company and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.'s
certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of the Company who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of
Viacom Inc. acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both the Company and Viacom Inc., such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity
to the Company or Viacom Inc. or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied
his or her fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, CBS Corp.'s certificate of incorporation provides that the Company renounces any interest in any such opportunity
presented to Viacom Inc. These provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity of one of such companies may be used for the benefit of the other company. 
 
    Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.     
        Not applicable.  
 
    Item 2.    Properties.     
        The Company maintains its world headquarters at 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, where it owns a building containing
approximately 900,000 square feet of space, 831,000 square feet of which is office space. The Company occupies approximately 276,000 square feet of the office space and leases the balance to third
parties. The Company owns the CBS Broadcast Center complex located on approximately 3.7 acres at 524 West 57th Street, New York, New York, which consists of approximately 860,000 square feet of
office and studio space. The Company also owns two studio facilities in California: (a) the CBS Studio Center at 4024 Radford Avenue, Studio City, California, located on approximately 40 acres,
and (b) CBS Television City at 7800 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, located on approximately 25 acres. Showtime Networks leases approximately 200,000 square feet at 1633 Broadway,
New York, New York under a lease which expires in 2026. Simon & Schuster leases approximately 290,000 square feet of office space at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, which lease
runs to 2019. CBS Interactive leases approximately 280,000 square feet of space at 235 2nd Street, San Francisco, California under a lease which expires in 2022. The Company and its
subsidiaries also own and lease office, studio and warehouse space, broadcast, antenna and satellite transmission facilities and outdoor advertising properties throughout the U.S., Canada and several
other foreign countries for its businesses. The Company considers its properties adequate for its present needs.  
 
    Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.     
         Securities Action.    On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and
Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and
October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results
during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On 
I-34



 
February 11,
2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System
(collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs
filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive Chairman. On July 13, 2009, all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On
March 16, 2010, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed this action as to the Company and all defendants. On April 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to serve
an amended complaint. On September 23, 2010, the court issued an order granting leave to amend. On October 8, 2010, the Company was served with an Amended Complaint, which redefines the
Class Period to be April 29, 2008 to October 10, 2008 and alleges that the impairment charge should have been taken during the first quarter of 2008. The Company filed a motion to
dismiss this Amended Complaint on November 19, 2010. On May 24, 2011, the court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of defendants on May 25, 2011. On
June 23, 2011, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
         E-books Actions.    Commencing on August 9, 2011, purported class action complaints have been filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California regarding the sale of electronic books pursuant to agency distribution
arrangements. On August 16, 2011, a motion was filed with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL Panel") by certain parties seeking to consolidate these actions
for pre-trial proceedings in one venue. On December 9, 2011, the MDL Panel issued an order consolidating the actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against Apple Inc., Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins
Publishers, Inc., Macmillan Publishers, Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Company's subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc. The plaintiffs, electronic book
purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and/or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of electronic books pursuant to agency distribution
arrangements between each of the publishers and electronic book retailers. The actions generally seek multiple forms of damages for the purchase of electronic books and injunctive and other relief.
Simon & Schuster intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions. In addition, certain federal and state governmental entities in the United States and the competition authority in the
European Community are conducting competition investigations of agency
distribution arrangements in this industry and Simon & Schuster is cooperating with these competition investigations. 
         Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.    The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to
asbestos and
other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse
was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the
plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly
caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos-containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in
commercial ships. 
        Claims
are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from
period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no
impairment. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had pending approximately 50,090 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 52,220 as of December 31, 2010 and 62,360 as of
December 31, 2009. During 2011, the Company received approximately 4,410 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket 
I-35



 

approximately
6,540 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants
on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The
Company's total costs for the years 2011 and 2010 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $33 million and
$14 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the
insured portion of the expenses. 
        Filings
include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be
caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are
asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the
plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and
assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing
of new claims. While the number
of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others,
the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities. 
        Other.    The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities
asserting that it is
or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives
personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. 
         General.    On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various
investigations and
inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict.
However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are
not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and
Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

tax), or $.19 per diluted share, to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets and to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the sale of certain
radio stations. In 2008, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax), or $19.00 per diluted share, principally to reduce
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
(b)On
June 30, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CNET Networks, Inc. ("CNET") for $1.8 billion. CNET has been included in the
Company's results since its acquisition.

    Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per
share amounts)     
        Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its
consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions
of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full
text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview  
        In 2011, CBS Corporation's results benefited from the continued popularity of its internally developed and acquired programming, new
licensing agreements for digital streaming of television series, growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, and the new programming agreement for the NCAA Division I
Men's Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament"). Beginning in 2011, pursuant to a 14-year agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc., the Company and Turner are sharing the rights to telecast the NCAA Tournament. For CBS Corp., this new agreement resulted in lower revenues, yet higher profits, for 2011 as
compared to 2010. In addition, revenue comparisons for 2011 were negatively impacted by the 2010 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television
Network. Total revenues increased 1% for 2011, as decreases associated with these non-comparable items as well as a decline in political advertising sales, were more than offset by 6%
growth in content licensing and distribution revenues, a 9% increase in affiliate and subscription fee revenues and underlying growth in advertising sales. 
        For
2011, operating income of $2.53 billion increased 39% from $1.82 billion for 2010 with growth in each of the Company's operating segments and an increase in the
Company's total operating income margin of five percentage points to 18%. These increases were driven by the change in the revenue mix, lower sports and other acquired television programming costs,
the benefit of cost-containment and the timing of production and distribution expenses. Comparability of operating income was impacted by restructuring charges of $46 million and
$81 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the favorable impact to 2010 from a settlement of $90 million for the resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed
businesses. 
        Diluted
earnings per share ("EPS") of $1.92 for 2011 increased $.88, or 85%, from $1.04 for 2010, primarily driven by the increase in operating income, lower interest expense due to a
$1.40 billion reduction to the Company's outstanding debt during 2010, and lower weighted average shares outstanding, reflecting the impact of 2011 share repurchases. 
        During
2011, the Company repurchased 42.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $1.02 billion, at an average cost of $24.14 per share, and paid
$206 million of cash dividends. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $5.98 billion of long-term debt outstanding, which is comparable to December 31, 2010. For
2011, free cash flow of $1.48 billion, increased 2% from $1.45 billion for 2010. Comparability of free cash flow was impacted by pension contributions of $410 million in 2011 and
$167 million in 2010, principally to pre-fund the Company's qualified plans. The Company generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.75 billion for 2011 versus
$1.74 billion for 2010. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases
to
the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information" on pages II-11 and II-12 for a
reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP"), to free cash flow.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  
CBS Corp. operates in the following five segments: 
ENTERTAINMENT:
The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS
Films and CBS Interactive.
Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 52%,
53% and 54% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
CABLE
NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian
Networks. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 11% to
consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 10% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 
PUBLISHING:
The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as  Simon & Schuster,
Pocket Books, Scribner and Free
Press. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. Publishing contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
LOCAL
BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio,
with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 19%, 20% and 18% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. 
OUTDOOR:
The Outdoor segment, through CBS Outdoor, displays advertising in North America, South America and Europe on media, including billboards,
transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Outdoor revenues are generated primarily from
advertising sales. The Outdoor segment contributed 13% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

        Advertising
sales decreased 2% to $9.01 billion in 2011 from $9.15 billion in 2010 as comparability for 2011 was impacted by the 2010 broadcast of  Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and the new
14-year programming agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. for the telecast of the NCAA Tournament, which began in 2011. In aggregate, these two non-comparable items negatively impacted the advertising revenue comparison by
four percentage points. Underlying advertising revenues for 2011 benefited from pricing increases for sports programming, growth in network primetime and higher outdoor advertising sales in the
Americas, partially offset by significantly lower political spending as 2010 benefited from midterm elections. In 2010, advertising sales increased 12% to $9.15 billion from
$8.17 billion in 2009, due in part to the recovery of an economic slow down and the continued popularity of the Company's content. The advertising growth also benefited from the 2010 telecast
of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and increased political advertising from the 2010 midterm elections. 
        Content
licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced programming to television, theaters and digital mediums, as well
as for home entertainment sales; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. Content licensing and distribution revenues
increased 6% to $3.25 billion in 2011 from $3.07 billion in 2010 reflecting growth in both domestic and international television license fees, principally driven by the impact of new
licensing agreements for digital streaming. Revenue contributions from significant domestic syndication availabilities in 2011, which included the third-cycle sale of  Frasier, were lower than 2010,
which included the second-cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
In 2010, content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% to $3.07 billion in 2010 from $3.12 billion in 2009 principally reflecting lower contributions from significant domestic
syndication availabilities, as 2010 included the second-cycle syndication sale of only one title as compared to 2009 which included the first-cycle availabilities of five titles. This decrease was
partially offset by higher international syndication sales of television programming and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010. 
        Affiliate
and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, telephone companies and other
distributors for the carriage of the Company's cable networks, as well as for retransmission consent for the CBS Television Network and the Company's owned and operated television stations; fees
received from non-CBS owned television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and subscriber fees for online content. For 2011, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9%
to $1.74 billion from $1.60 billion in 2010 and for 2010, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% from $1.46 billion in 2009. These increases reflect growth in subscriptions
and rate increases at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, and higher retransmission revenues. 
        Other
revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor operations, increased 1% to $240 million in 2011 from
$238 million in 2010. For 2010, other

revenues
decreased 9% to $238 million in 2010 from $261 million in 2009, principally reflecting lower ancillary digital revenues. 
 International Revenues  
        The Company generated approximately 15% of its total revenues from international regions in both 2011 and 2010, and 14% in 2009.

        Programming expenses represented 36% of total operating expenses in 2011, 39% in 2010 and 38% in 2009, and reflect the amortization of acquired
rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses decreased 15% to $2.97 billion in 2011 from $3.51 billion in
2010 primarily reflecting lower costs for sports programming, including the impact of the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which began in 2011, and the absence of the 2010 broadcast
of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as lower acquired television series costs. For 2010, programming expenses increased 5% to
$3.51 billion in 2010 from $3.34 billion in 2009 reflecting higher sports programming costs, principally associated with the 2010 Super Bowl telecast and the NCAA Tournament on the CBS
Television Network, partially offset by lower acquired television series costs. 
        Production
expenses represented 23% of total operating expenses in 2011 and 2010, and 24% in 2009, and reflect the direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film
content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses decreased 6% to $1.94 billion in 2011 from
$2.06 billion in 2010 principally driven by the title mix from licensing arrangements for television programming. For 2010, production expenses of $2.06 billion 
II-7



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
remained
relatively flat compared to 2009 reflecting lower costs associated with lower domestic syndication sales, offset by increased investment in new television series and theatrical films. 
        Billboard,
transit and other occupancy expenses represented 12% of total operating expenses in 2011, 11% in 2010 and 12% in 2009, and reflect lease and franchise costs associated with
billboards, transit and other outdoor displays, rent expense on production facilities, and other occupancy costs. Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $1.04 billion
in 2011 from $1.03 billion in 2010 primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, partially offset by the settlement of legal matters in 2011 and lower costs from the mix of
more profitable contracts. For 2010, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $1.03 billion in 2010 from $1.02 billion in 2009 primarily driven by franchise
expense increases attributable to new Outdoor transit contracts, partially offset by decreases for lost contracts, lower billboard lease costs, as well as lower maintenance and display site costs and
other cost reductions due to cost-savings initiatives. 
        Participation,
distribution and royalty costs, which represented 10% of total operating expenses in 2011, 8% in 2010 and 7% in 2009, primarily include participation and residual expenses
for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, including print and advertising.
Participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 17% to $814 million in 2011 from $693 million in 2010 primarily reflecting higher participations from the licensing of titles for
digital streaming and the mix of domestic syndication sales, partially offset by lower advertising and other distribution costs from the timing of theatrical film releases. For 2010, participation,
distribution and royalty costs increased 16% to $693 million from $597 million in 2009 primarily reflecting higher advertising expenses for theatrical films. 
        Other
operating expenses, which represented 19% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, primarily include compensation costs, costs associated with book
sales, including printing and warehousing, and costs associated with the production and hosting of websites. For 2011, other operating expenses decreased 5% to $1.61 billion from
$1.69 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with the absence of sponsorship revenues resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament. For 2010, other
operating expenses remained relatively flat at $1.69 billion compared to 2009. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
        Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and
back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009. SG&A expenses increased $140 million, or 5%,
to $2.76 billion in 2011 from $2.62 billion in 2010 principally due to a settlement of $90 million recorded in 2010 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes
regarding previously disposed businesses, higher advertising and increased selling expenses primarily associated with higher revenues, partially offset by $36 million lower pension and
postretirement benefit costs primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2010. 
        For
2010, SG&A expenses increased $127 million, or 5%, to $2.62 billion from $2.49 billion in 2009 principally reflecting higher advertising, selling expenses and
incentive compensation driven by the improved operating results, partially offset by $51 million lower pension and postretirement benefits costs primarily due to the favorable performance of
pension plan assets in 2009. Comparability of SG&A expenses was impacted by settlements related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses of
$90 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009 and gains of $40 million in 2009 from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets.

 Restructuring Charges  
        During the year ended December 31, 2011, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring
plans, which primarily included relocation or closure of certain business activities, as well as other exit activities. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $46 million,
reflecting $34 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and $12 million of severance costs. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $81 million and $23 million, respectively. The charges reflected $87 million of severance costs and $22 million of contract termination
and other associated costs, partially offset by reversals of $5 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. As of December 31, 2011, the
cumulative amount paid for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 restructuring charges was $100 million, of which $81 million was for severance costs and $19 million was related to
contract termination and other associated costs. The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining reserves by the end of 2013.

 Impairment Charges  
        The Company performs an annual fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily
comprised of FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Based on the results of the 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests no impairment charge was required. 
        During
2009, as a result of the Company's annual impairment test of FCC licenses, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $178 million
at the Local Broadcasting segment to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. This impairment resulted from reductions in projections for advertising revenues due to a
weakened radio advertising marketplace. 
II-9




 










Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  
        Also in 2009, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of
$32 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $21 million and the allocated goodwill by $11 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization  
        Depreciation and amortization decreased $15 million, or 3%, to $548 million for 2011 from $563 million for 2010
principally reflecting lower depreciation and amortization associated with reduced capital expenditures in recent years. For 2010, depreciation and amortization decreased $20 million, or 3%, to
$563 million from $583 million for 2009 principally reflecting lower depreciation for outdoor advertising properties and lower depreciation and amortization associated with interactive
businesses. 
 Interest Expense  
        Interest expense decreased $93 million, or 18%, to $436 million for 2011 and decreased $13 million, or 2%, to
$529 million for 2010 from $542 million for 2009, in both cases primarily resulting from the reduction of debt during 2010. The Company had $5.98 billion and $6.00 billion
of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, each at a weighted average interest rate of 7%. 
 Interest Income  
        Interest income increased $1 million to $7 million for 2011 from $6 million for 2010. For 2010, interest income
was flat at $6 million compared to 2009. 
 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  
        For 2010, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81 million was associated with the repurchase and redemption of
$2.07 billion of the Company's debt, of which $750 million was repurchased through a tender offer. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). 
        For
2009, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million was associated with the repurchase of $978 million of the Company's debt, of which $826 million was
repurchased through a tender offer. 
 Other Items, Net  
        For 2011, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $17 million primarily consisting of foreign exchange losses. 
        For
2010, "Other items, net" of $10 million primarily consisted of gains of $21 million associated with dispositions, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of
$10 million. 
        For
2009, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $2 million primarily consisting of losses of $7 million associated with securitizing accounts receivables and a
non-cash charge of $8 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments, partially offset by foreign
exchange gains of $11 million. 
 Provision for Income Taxes  
        The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations
before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 
II-10



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
2011,
the provision for income taxes increased to $755 million from $463 million in 2010 and for 2010, the provision for income taxes increased from $183 million in 2009. These
increases were primarily driven by the increase in earnings before income taxes. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2010 included a $62 million reduction of deferred tax assets
associated with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, partially offset by a $26 million reversal of previously established deferred tax liabilities and a tax benefit of
$28 million from the settlement of income tax audits. Included in the Company's tax provision for 2009 were tax benefits of $47 million from settlements of income tax audits, a benefit
of $79 million associated with the non-cash impairment charges, and reductions
of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation of $43 million. This reduction reflected the difference between the estimated tax benefit recognized based on the grant date fair
value of the stock-based compensation award versus the actual tax benefit realized based on the market value on the date of vest. 
        The
Company's effective income tax rate was 36% in 2011, 38% in 2010 and 41% in 2009. For 2012, the Company's annual effective tax rate is expected to be similar to 2011 and 2010 levels. 
 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  
        Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $37 million for 2011, $35 million for 2010 and $33 million
for 2009 reflecting the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments. 
 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations  
        The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.29 billion for 2011, $724 million for 2010 and
$227 million for 2009. 
 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations  
        During 2011, the Company reached favorable resolutions of certain contingencies related to its previously disposed businesses which are
accounted for as discontinued operations. As a result, a pre-tax gain of $23 million ($14 million, net of tax) was recorded in discontinued operations. 
 Net Earnings  
        The Company reported net earnings of $1.31 billion for 2011, $724 million for 2010 and $227 million for 2009,
principally driven by the growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense. In addition, comparability of net earnings was impacted by several large discrete items, including
pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $210 million ($131 million, net of tax) in 2009, settlements of $90 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009
from the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses, restructuring charges of $46 million in 2011, $81 million in 2010 and $23 million in
2009, and pre-tax losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $81 million in 2010 and $30 million in 2009. 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  
        Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for)
operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating
activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
        The
Company's calculation of free cash flow for 2009 does not include increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program because the Company does not consider the
cash flow from this 
II-11



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
program
to be indicative of the cash generated by the underlying operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, the Company considers its decision to increase or decrease its accounts receivable
securitization program a financing decision. In 2010, as a result of the adoption of amended FASB guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, increases and decreases to the accounts
receivable securitization program are reflected as financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Under the previous guidance these changes were reflected as operating activities.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Also, the Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures since investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash
that is directly related to the Company's operations. 
        Management
believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments,
maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to
generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the
presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the
method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used
externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry. 
        As
free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by
(used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, and does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and
is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected in free cash flow. 
        The
following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

 Segment Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009  
        The following tables present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and
impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before
Impairment Charges" or "Segment OIBDA" if there is no impairment charge), operating income (loss), depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges by segment, for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges (or Segment OIBDA) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in
accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors
to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation
of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges to the Company's consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 14 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

 2011 vs. 2010  
        For 2011, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $7.46 billion from $7.39 billion in 2010. This growth was led by 10%
higher revenues from domestic and international television license fees, driven by licensing agreements for digital streaming, partially offset by lower contributions from significant domestic
syndication availabilities, which included the third-cycle domestic cable sale of Frasier in 2011 and the second-cycle sale of  CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in 2010. Revenue growth also reflects higher retransmission revenues and underlying advertising revenue increases from
higher pricing for the broadcast of sporting events and higher primetime advertising for the CBS Television Network. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the 2010 telecast of  Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network as well as the impact of the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which resulted in lower
revenues, but higher profits for 2011. 
        For
2011, Entertainment operating income increased $523 million, or 74% to $1.23 billion from $708 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased $520 million, or 60%,
to $1.39 billion from $871 million for 2010 with improved operating income and OIBDA margins of seven percentage points to 17% and 19%, respectively. The operating income and OIBDA
increases, and margin improvement reflect the aforementioned revenue growth, significantly lower sports programming costs resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament and the
absence of the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network, as well as cost decreases associated with the timing of production and distribution expenses. Restructuring charges of
$40 million in 2011 principally reflect costs associated with exiting operating facilities and severance costs. For 2010, restructuring charges of $23 million principally reflect
severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Entertainment results included stock-based compensation expense of $45 million for 2011 and $43 million for 2010. 
        License
fees for completed television programming in syndication, on cable and video on demand, and digitally streamed are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are
available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $1.25 billion
and $654 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 2010 vs. 2009  
        For 2010, Entertainment revenues increased 6% to $7.39 billion from $6.98 billion in 2009 primarily reflecting higher
advertising and retransmission revenues, partially offset by lower content licensing and distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 11% primarily reflecting higher national advertising
revenues, driven by higher pricing due to the economic recovery and the strength of Network primetime and sports programming, including the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl
XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as growth in CBS Interactive display advertising revenues. Revenues from content licensing and distribution decreased 3% as higher
international syndication sales, the second-cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010, were more than
offset by the first-cycle domestic syndication sales of five major titles in 2009. 
        For
2010, Entertainment operating income increased 1% to $708 million from $700 million for 2009 and OIBDA decreased $5 million to $871 million from
$876 million in 2009 as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher sports programming costs, principally attributable to Super Bowl
XLIV and the 2010 NCAA Tournament, increased investment in television and film content, and restructuring charges of $23 million incurred in 2010. Entertainment results
included stock-based compensation expense of $43 million for 2010 and $44 million for 2009. 
        Capital
expenditures increased $18 million to $90 million in 2010 from $72 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending for high-definition
upgrades.

 2011 vs. 2010  
        For 2011, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $1.62 billion from $1.48 billion in 2010 primarily driven by 7% higher
affiliate revenues reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, as well as higher licensing revenues from international
syndication, digital streaming and home entertainment sales of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2011 subscriptions totaled
73 million for Showtime Networks, including Showtime, The Movie Channel and  Flix, 44 million for
CBS Sports Network and 12 million for Smithsonian Networks. 
        For
2011, Cable Networks operating income increased 26% to $684 million from $543 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 25% to $707 million from $566 million
for 2010, primarily due to revenue growth

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
and
lower costs for theatrical programming, partially offset by higher programming and advertising costs for Showtime original series. Cable Networks
results included stock-based compensation expense of $4 million for 2011 and $5 million for 2010. 
 2010 vs. 2009  
        For 2010, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $1.48 billion from $1.35 billion in 2009 primarily due to 8% higher
affiliate fees, reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks and CBS Sports Network, as well as higher revenues from the licensing of  Showtime original series. As of
December 31, 2010 subscriptions totaled 67 million for Showtime Networks, including  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, 39 million
for CBS Sports Network, and 7 million for Smithsonian Networks. 
        For
2010, Cable Networks operating income increased 24% to $543 million from $437 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 23% to $566 million from $461 million
for 2009, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing and advertising costs for new Showtime original series as well as to
support the overall growth of Showtime Networks and higher costs for sports programming. Restructuring charges of $3 million in 2010 principally reflect costs associated with exiting an
operating
facility. Cable Networks results included stock-based compensation expense of $5 million for 2010 and $6 million for 2009. 
        Capital
expenditures increased $11 million to $19 million in 2010 from $8 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending on high-definition upgrades
and leasehold improvements.

 2011 vs. 2010  
        For 2011, Publishing revenues decreased 1% to $787 million from $791 million in 2010 as strong growth in digital sales of
Publishing content was offset by lower print book sales. Revenues from digital content of $133 million for 2011 more than doubled 2010 digital sales and represented 17% of total Publishing
revenues in 2011. Best selling titles in 2011 included Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson and 11/22/63 by
Stephen King. 
        For
2011, Publishing operating income increased 36% to $83 million from $61 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 32% to $90 million from $68 million for 2010
driven by lower direct operating costs, 
II-17



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
including
expense decreases resulting from the significant increase in more profitable digital revenues as a percentage of total revenues, lower bad debt expense and the impact of
cost-containment measures. Restructuring charges in 2011 and 2010 reflect severance costs. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $3 million for both 2011
and 2010. 
 2010 vs. 2009  
        For 2010, Publishing revenues decreased slightly to $791 million from $793 million in 2009 primarily reflecting lower
book sales in the adult group, partially offset by growth in sales of digital content of 122%. Revenues from digital content represent 8% of total Publishing revenues in 2010. Best selling titles in
2010 included Glenn Beck's Broke and The Overton Window and Spoken from the
Heart by Laura Bush. 
        For
2010, Publishing operating income increased 42% to $61 million from $43 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 36% to $68 million from $50 million for 2009
reflecting lower production expenses from a change in the mix of titles and the impact of cost reduction measures, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The restructuring charges in 2010 and
2009 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $3 million for 2010 and $4 million for 2009. 
 Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)

 2011 vs. 2010  
        For 2011, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 3% to $2.69 billion from $2.78 billion for 2010 principally driven by
lower political advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues decreased 7% due to the difficult comparison to the prior year, which included significant political advertising for midterm
elections and revenues from the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast. Comparability was also impacted by lost revenues resulting from the National Basketball Association lockout during 2011. These decreases were
partially offset by growth in many key advertising categories, led by domestic automotive and financial services as well as higher retransmission revenues. CBS Radio revenues increased slightly from
the prior year, despite lower political advertising spending, reflecting growth in domestic auto, financial services and retail advertising. 
II-18



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        For
2011, Local Broadcasting operating income increased 1% to $750 million from $740 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 1% to $849 million from $840 million
for 2010 primarily due to lower programming and production costs for syndicated and sports programming, and restructuring charges of $25 million recorded in 2010, partially offset by the
revenue decline. Local Broadcasting results included stock-based compensation expense of $22 million for 2011 and $20 million for 2010. 
 2010 vs. 2009  
        For 2010, Local Broadcasting revenues increased 18% to $2.78 billion from $2.36 billion for 2009 driven by growth in
advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues increased 27% as a result of the improved local advertising marketplace with growth across many key categories, led by automotive, retail and
financial services, as well as higher political advertising for midterm election, and the benefit of the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV to the
Company's owned CBS affiliated stations. CBS Radio revenues for 2010 increased 9% reflecting the improved advertising
marketplace with growth in many key categories, led by automotive and retail, and higher political advertising sales. 
        For
2010, Local Broadcasting operating income increased $528 million to $740 million from $212 million for 2009. Included in 2009 operating income were
non-cash impairment charges of $210 million. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges increased 64% to $840 million for 2010 from $513 million for 2009 and
OIBDA before impairment charges margins increased to 30% in 2010 from 22% in 2009. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth, and lower programming and talent expenses due to expense
reduction measures, partially offset by gains of $40 million recorded in 2009 from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets and higher restructuring charges in 2010.
Restructuring charges of $25 million for 2010 reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions, and contract terminations and other associated costs. Local Broadcasting
results included stock-based compensation of $20 million for 2010 and $21 million for 2009. 
 Dispositions  
        In August 2010, the Company completed the sale of its television station in Norfolk, Virginia to Local TV Holdings, LLC, for
$17 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $8 million included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. 
        On
September 30, 2009, the Company completed the sale of four of its owned radio stations in Portland, Oregon to Alpha Broadcasting for $40 million. In connection with the
sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $32 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill. 
        On
April 1, 2009, the Company completed a transaction with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. for the swap of five of its mid-size market stations in Baltimore,
Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. On March 6, 2009, the Company completed the sale of three of its owned radio stations in Denver to
Wilks Broadcasting for $20 million.

NMNot meaningful 

 2011 vs. 2010  
        For 2011, Outdoor revenues increased 4% to $1.89 billion from $1.82 billion in 2010 reflecting further improvement in the
outdoor advertising marketplace in the Americas (comprising North America and South America) and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Revenues for the Americas increased 5% (4% in
constant dollars) to $1.29 billion, reflecting growth in the U.S. billboards and displays businesses driven by rate increases. Revenues for Europe increased 3% to $608 million for 2011
primarily due to foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe decreased 2% reflecting weakness in the European economy. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes
on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $33 million for 2011. Approximately 44% and 45% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        For
2011, Outdoor operating income increased $93 million to $107 million from $14 million in 2010. Outdoor OIBDA increased 30% to $342 million for 2011 from
$263 million for 2010 and Outdoor OIBDA margins increased to 18% for 2011 from 14% for 2010. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth and decreased costs resulting from lower
restructuring charges, the mix of more profitable contracts and the settlement of legal matters in 2011. Restructuring charges of $4 million for 2011 reflect severance costs. Outdoor results
included stock-based compensation expense of $6 million for 2011 and $5 million for 2010. 
        Due
to the challenging advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contact, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels. 
        Capital
expenditures decreased $12 million to $66 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 principally reflecting decreased capital spending in Europe. 
 2010 vs. 2009  
        For 2010, Outdoor revenues increased 6% to $1.82 billion from $1.72 billion for 2009 reflecting the improved advertising
marketplace. Revenues for the Americas increased 10% (8% in constant dollars) to $1.23 billion, primarily reflecting stronger U.S. billboards and displays businesses driven by higher occupancy
rates, the impact of new transit contracts, and increases in Canada. Revenues for Europe of 
II-20



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
$592 million
for 2010 remained relatively flat compared to 2009. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe increased 3% from 2009 reflecting revenue growth in the United Kingdom, Holland and
Italy, partially offset by lower revenues in France. Revenues for Asia decreased $13 million to $2 million for 2010 reflecting the deconsolidation of Outdoor China. During the first
quarter of 2010, the Company sold its controlling interest in Outdoor China, resulting in the deconsolidation of the operations and its subsequent treatment as an equity method investment. The
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $4 million for 2010. Approximately 45% and 47% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions
outside the U.S. for 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
        For
2010, Outdoor reported operating income of $14 million versus an operating loss of $97 million for 2009. Outdoor OIBDA increased 56% to $263 million for 2010
from $169 million for 2009 and Outdoor OIBDA margins increased to 14% for 2010 from 10% for 2009. These increases were driven by the revenue growth as well as lower billboard lease, maintenance
and display site costs from cost-savings initiatives and lost contracts, partially offset by costs for new transit contracts and higher restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of
$26 million for 2010 primarily reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in Europe. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $5 million for
2010 versus $6 million for 2009. 
        Capital
expenditures decreased $13 million to $78 million in 2010 from $91 million in 2009 principally reflecting decreased spending for transit contracts in the
United Kingdom. 
 Corporate  
        For 2011, corporate expenses increased 5% to $252 million from $239 million for 2010 primarily reflecting higher
incentive compensation associated with the Company's improved operating results. For 2010, corporate expenses increased 44% to $239 million from $166 million for 2009 primarily
reflecting the absence of the 2009 favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement and higher incentive compensation. Corporate expenses included stock-based compensation
expense of $60 million for 2011 and 2010, and $55 million for 2009. 
 Residual Costs  
        Residual costs primarily include pension and postretirement benefits costs for plans retained by the Company for previously divested
businesses. Residual costs were $75 million for 2011, $15 million for 2010 and $116 million for 2009. Comparability was impacted by settlements of $90 million in 2010 and
$28 million in 2009 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses. In addition, residual costs for 2011 and 2010 benefited from the favorable
performance of pension plan assets in 2010 and 2009, as well as the pre-funding of the Company's pension plans during 2010 and 2009. 
 Financial Position  
        Current assets increased by $148 million to $5.54 billion at December 31, 2011 from $5.40 billion at
December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $180 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 3.4% at
December 31, 2011 compared with 3.9% at December 31, 2010, primarily due to the write-off of previously reserved receivables.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        Net
property and equipment of $2.51 billion at December 31, 2011 decreased by $184 million from $2.69 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily
reflecting depreciation expense of $426 million and fixed asset dispositions, partially offset by capital expenditures of $265 million. 
        Goodwill
increased by $96 million to $8.62 billion at December 31, 2011 from $8.52 billion at December 31, 2010 primarily reflecting acquisitions of
domestic and international internet businesses, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments. 
        Intangible
assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, decreased by $98 million to $6.53 billion at December 31,
2011 from $6.62 billion at December 31, 2010 due to amortization expense of $122 million, partially offset by intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of
internet businesses. 
        Pension
and postretirement benefit obligations decreased by $147 million to $1.84 billion at December 31, 2011 from $1.99 billion at December 31, 2010,
primarily reflecting pension contributions made during 2011, principally to pre-fund the Company's qualified plans, partially offset by actuarial losses resulting from the decrease in the
discount rate and other changes to actuarial assumptions. 
        Other
liabilities decreased $143 million to $2.38 billion at December 31, 2011 from $2.52 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting decreases
related to programming rights. 
 Cash Flows  
        Cash and cash equivalents increased by $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by
$237 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and increased by $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as

         Operating Activities.    In 2011, cash provided by operating activities increased $14 million to $1.75 billion from
$1.74 billion
in 2010 principally driven by growth in operating income and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans and lower contributions from
changes in working capital. Working capital reflected a use of cash in 2011, principally due to the timing of collections from television licensing arrangements, and a source of cash in 2010 mainly
from the Super Bowl telecast on the CBS Television Network. 
        In
2010, cash provided by operating activities increased $796 million to $1.74 billion from $939 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher operating income, the
timing of programming payments and a $150 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the company's accounts receivable securitization program during 2009. These increases were partially
offset by higher payments for taxes and higher discretionary contributions to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans. On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB
guidance on the accounting for transfers of
financial assets and as a result, decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program during 2010 are reflected as cash flows used for financing activities. 
II-22



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        The
Company made pension contributions of $410 million in 2011, $167 million in 2010 and $20 million in 2009, principally to pre-fund its qualified
plans. 
        Cash
paid for income taxes was $235 million for 2011, $248 million for 2010 and $56 million for 2009. The decrease in cash taxes for 2011 was driven by tax benefits
from funding the Company's qualified pension plans and the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher tax payments associated with an increase in taxable income. The
increase in cash taxes for 2010 reflects higher taxable income and the impact of refunds received during 2009 resulting from the filing of income tax returns for prior years. 
         Investing Activities.    In 2011, cash used for investing activities of $389 million principally reflected capital expenditures of
$265 million, investments in investee companies of $79 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW and international television ventures, and payment for acquisitions of
$75 million, primarily for internet businesses, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $22 million. In 2010, cash used for investing activities of $368 million
principally reflected capital expenditures of $284 million and investments in investee companies of $90 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW and international television
ventures, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $18 million, primarily from the sale of a television station. In 2009, cash used for investing activities of $249 million
principally reflected capital expenditures of $262 million, investments in investee companies of $56 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW, and purchases of marketable
securities of $36 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $131 million, primarily from the sales of radio stations and certain long-lived assets of the

expenditures were $265 million in 2011, $284 million in 2010 and $262 million in 2009. For 2012, capital expenditures are anticipated to be at similar levels
as the prior three years. 
        Financing Activities.    In 2011, cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS
Corp.
Class B Common Stock for $1.01 billion under the Company's share repurchase program, dividend payments of $206 million and the payment of employee payroll taxes in
lieu of issuing shares for restricted stock unit vests of $82 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $72 million and the excess tax benefit from
stock-based compensation of $72 million. For 2010, cash used for financing activities of $1.60 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of
$2.13 billion, a $400 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the account receivable securitization program and dividend payments of $142 million, partially offset by
proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.09 billion. In 2009, cash used for financing activities of $393 million principally reflected the repayment of senior debt of
$1.01 billion and dividend payments of $297 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $973 million. 
 Dividends  
        On February 23, 2012, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share on its Class A and Class B
Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2012. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2011, 2010 and
2009, resulting in total annual dividends of $237 million, $139 million and $136 million, respectively. During 2011, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend from $.05 to
$.10, beginning with the dividend paid in the third quarter. Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance.

(a)At
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $4 million and
$1 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $75 million and $83 million,
respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $5.92 billion at December 31, 2011 and $5.94 billion at December 31, 2010.
(b)Included
in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

        Total debt of $6.00 billion at December 31, 2011 and $6.02 billion at December 31, 2010 was 38% as a percentage of the
total capitalization of the Company. 
        The
senior debt of CBS Corp., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52 million of the
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., has no guarantor. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the Company classified $490 million of senior notes and debentures maturing in August 2012 as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. 
        For
the year ended December 31, 2010, debt issuances, redemptions and repurchases were as follows:

 Credit Facility  
        At December 31, 2011, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2015 (the
"Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined
at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior
unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. 
        The
Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0x at the end of each quarter and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the
trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 1.8x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio
was approximately 7.8x. 
        The
Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a
quarter, to the Company's Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before
depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash items. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's cash interest expense on
indebtedness, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, in each case for the trailing four consecutive quarters. 
        The
primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its
$2.0 billion commercial paper program. At December 31, 2011, the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.98 billion.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  
        The Company participated in a revolving accounts receivable securitization program, prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010,
which provided for the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company
reduced the amounts outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program to zero from $400 million at December 31, 2009 and terminated the program. 
        On
January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets which required the Company's securitized accounts receivables to
be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding increase to debt. As a result, the decrease to the accounts receivable securitization program of $400 million during 2010 is
reflected as cash flows used for financing activities and the decrease of $150 million during 2009 is reflected as cash flows used for operating activities under previous FASB guidance. 
        During
the period before the termination of the program in 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of
$263 million and $1.47 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the program's accounts
receivables was $1 million for 2010 and $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
        The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows
generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company's operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming,
talent contracts, operating leases, franchise payments, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company's investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share
repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit
Facility, which had $1.98 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2011, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements
for the next twelve months. 
        The
Company's funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding
requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the
existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. 
        Funding
for the Company's long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $1.19 billion is expected to come from cash generated from operating activities
and the Company's ability to refinance its debt.

(b)Outdoor
has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station
platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant
advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.
(c)Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms,
including open purchase orders.
(d)Consists
of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future
minimum payments of $2.24 billion include $879 million for Outdoor billboards.

        The table above excludes future contributions to the Company's pension plans and $195 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and
the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and periods in which cash payments relating to these items are expected to occur. In 2012, the
Company expects to contribute approximately $55 million primarily to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. The Company, at its
discretion, may make additional contributions in 2012 to pre-fund its qualified pension plans. Also in 2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $70 million to its other
postretirement benefit plans, to satisfy the Company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
        The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against
non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $389 million and were not recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
        Prior
to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to
obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases
related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and
Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties. 
        In
the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the
Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification
obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Critical Accounting Policies  
        The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. 
        The
Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and require
significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant
accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Programming and Production Costs  
        Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues
to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized
production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases
these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films. 
II-28



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        The
costs incurred in acquiring television programs are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is
expected to be derived. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the
program. 
        Ultimate
revenue estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming are updated regularly based on
information available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating ultimate revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated
economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value
adjustments and estimated accruals for participation expense. 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
        The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the
fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. 
         GoodwillGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. For its annual
impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance which permits the Company to choose to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If based on this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value
of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. For 2011, the Company performed this qualitative assessment for six
reporting units that each had an estimated fair value for the 2010 annual impairment test that was in excess of its carrying value by 20% or more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the
relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included the results of the
most recent impairment tests, as well as financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting
units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry during 2011, where applicable. The Company concluded
that each of the reporting unit specific and industry factors had either a positive or neutral impact on the fair value of each of the reporting units. The Company also determined that macroeconomic
factors during 2011 did not have a significant impact on the discount rates and growth rates used for the 2010 annual impairment tests. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that
for these six reporting units, performing the two-step impairment test was unnecessary and no impairment charge was required for 2011. 
        The
Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining three reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test requires the Company to then compare the implied fair
value of that reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill to determine the amount of impairment charge, if any. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based
upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). For 2011, the Discounted
Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds 
II-29



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
the
present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of
significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the
projection period are based on the Company's internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is
based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections, and for 2011 was between 2.0% and 3.0%. The discount rates, which for 2011 ranged from 8.5% to
10.0%, are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher
cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these
assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet. 
        Based
on the 2011 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the fair value of each of the three reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the goodwill
impairment test exceeded their respective carrying values. The individual carrying values of the following reporting units were within 10% of their respective estimated fair values:

        At December 31, 2011 the carrying value of goodwill for the CBS Interactive and CBS Radio reporting units was $974 million and
$1.89 billion, respectively. An increase to the discount rates of 60 basis points and 65 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth
rates of 105 basis points and 95 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their
respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. 
         FCC LicensesFCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset by geographic
market with its carrying value. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit
of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method
("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and
building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method
adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the
residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the
start-up station's

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
operating
costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the
point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based
on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are similarly estimated based on industry-average data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate,
which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average
cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry. 
        The
discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2011 were as follows:

        The assumptions used in determining fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and
circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and
judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and
operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact advertisers' ability or
willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and retail,
have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, a decrease in spending by advertisers in these
categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying
values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses. 
        Based
on the 2011 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no
impairment charge was necessary. However, three radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $323 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair
value, and six radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.20 billion, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. Additionally, one television
market, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $74 million, was within 5% of its estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated
fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values at December 31, 2011 by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in
impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Reserves and Legal Matters  
        Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental
matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
continually
evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters
related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is
based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim
of resolution and the filing of new claims. 
 Pensions  
        Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in
accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average yield on portfolios of
high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet each of the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The
expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various
classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2011, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate as well as changes in other
actuarial assumptions. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will
result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $100 million and will not have a material impact on the 2012 pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25
basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $9 million in 2012 pension expense. 
 Income Taxes  
        The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In
the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of
years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized tax benefits of
$6 million and $28 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected
to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical
merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state
as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for
uncertain tax positions of $195 million at December 31, 2011 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

 Legal Matters  
        Securities Action.    On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and
Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and
October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results
during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha,
Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System (collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in
this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive
Chairman. On July 13, 2009, all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On March 16, 2010, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed this action as to the Company
and all defendants. On April 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to serve an amended complaint. On September 23, 2010, the court issued an order granting leave to amend. On
October 8, 2010, the Company was served with an Amended Complaint, which redefines the Class Period to be April 29, 2008 to October 10, 2008 and alleges that the impairment charge
should have been taken during the first quarter of 2008. The Company filed a motion to dismiss this Amended Complaint on November 19, 2010. On May 24, 2011, the court granted the motion
to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of defendants on May 25, 2011. On June 23, 2011, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. 
         CBS Outdoor and London Underground Actions.    Beginning in 2010, CBS Outdoor Limited filed legal proceedings and claims against London
Underground
Limited with respect to disputes arising under the 2006 transit contract between the parties, and London Underground Limited filed counterclaims with respect to its claims. In December 2011, the
parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving these matters, which is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. CBS Outdoor Limited continues to operate the London
Underground advertising concession. 
         E-books Actions.    Commencing on August 9, 2011, purported class action complaints have been filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California regarding the sale of electronic books pursuant to agency distribution
arrangements. On August 16, 2011, a motion was filed with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL Panel") by certain parties seeking to consolidate these actions
for pre-trial proceedings in one venue. On December 9, 2011, the MDL Panel issued an order consolidating the actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against Apple Inc., Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins
Publishers, Inc., Macmillan Publishers, Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Company's subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc. The plaintiffs, electronic book
purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and/or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of
electronic books pursuant to agency distribution arrangements between each of the publishers and electronic book retailers. The actions generally seek multiple forms of damages for the purchase of
electronic books and injunctive and other relief. Simon & Schuster intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions. In addition, certain federal and state governmental entities in the
United States and the competition authority in the European Community are conducting competition

investigations
of agency distribution arrangements in this industry and Simon & Schuster is cooperating with these competition investigations. 
         Indecency Regulation.    In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the
Company's owned
television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the
Company's television stations (the "Super Bowl Proceeding"). In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the
forfeiture with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in
September 2007. In July 2008, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed a petition
for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision. The petition requested that the United States Supreme Court not act on the petition until it ruled
in the "fleeting expletives case" mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCC's petition for certiorari. 
        In
another case involving broadcasts on another network, in June 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the
broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC (the "fleeting expletives case"). On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted the
FCC's petition to review the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision. On November 4, 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard argument in this case. On
April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision reversing the Second Circuit's judgment on administrative grounds in favor of the FCC and remanding the
fleeting expletives case to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit requested additional briefing and argument was heard on January 13, 2010. On July 13, 2010, the Second Circuit struck
down an FCC policy on indecency and found that the FCC's indecency policies and decisions regarding the use of "fleeting expletives" on radio and television violated the First Amendment. On
August 25, 2010, the FCC filed a petition for rehearing en banc and, on August 31, 2010, the Second Circuit issued an order directing all parties and intervenors to file briefs in
response to the FCC's petition on September 21, 2010, which were filed. On November 22, 2010, the Second Circuit denied the FCC's petition for rehearing. On April 21, 2011, the
FCC filed a combined petition for certiorari seeking review of the Second Circuit's decision in this case and also in an indecency case involving a broadcast on another television network. On
June 27, 2011, the United States Supreme
Court granted the FCC's petition for certiorari. On January 10, 2012, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in these cases. 
        Following
the April 28, 2009 decision in the fleeting expletives case, on May 4, 2009, the United States Supreme Court remanded the Super Bowl Proceeding to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and requested supplemental briefing from the Company and the FCC, in light of the United States Supreme Court's fleeting expletives decision. Argument was
heard by the Third Circuit in the Super Bowl Proceeding on February 23, 2010. On May 18, 2010 and on December 22, 2010, at the Third Circuit's request, the Company and the FCC
each submitted supplemental briefs. On November 2, 2011, the Third Circuit upheld its earlier decision to vacate the FCC's order to have the Company pay the $550,000 forfeiture. 
        In
March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC
proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations.
The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures. 
II-34



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        Additionally,
the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the
Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material. 
         Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.    The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to
asbestos and
other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse
was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the
plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly
caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos-containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in
commercial ships. 
        Claims
are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from
period to period.
The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of
December 31, 2011, the Company had pending approximately 50,090 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 52,220 as of December 31, 2010 and 62,360 as of December 31, 2009.
During 2011, the Company received approximately 4,410 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 6,540 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a
dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the
injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2011 and 2010 for settlement and defense of asbestos
claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $33 million and $14 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims
may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
        Filings
include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be
caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are
asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the
plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and
assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing
of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may
occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities. 
         Other.    The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities
asserting that it is
or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives
personal injury claims including toxic tort and product

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
liability
claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. 
        General.    On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various
investigations and
inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict.
However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are
not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and
Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named. 
 Market Risk  
        The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative
financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative
instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk  
        The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when
translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro,
the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film
production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of
operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The
change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange
derivatives centrally. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $151 million which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. At
December 31, 2010, the notional amount
of all foreign currency contracts was $114 million, of which $2 million related to the hedging of future production costs and $112 million represented hedges of expected foreign
currency cash flows. 
 Interest Rate Risk  
        All of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2009, the Company entered
into fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements for a portion of its debt, which were designated as fair value hedges. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps were recorded as a
change in the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk being hedged. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company settled all of its interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not
have any interest rate swaps outstanding during 2011 or 2010. 
II-36



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 Credit Risk  
        The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its
financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the
counterparties. 
        The
Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2011 or 2010, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic
areas to which the Company's products and services are sold. 
 Related Parties  
         National Amusements, Inc.    National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is the controlling stockholder of CBS Corp. Mr. Sumner M.
Redstone,
the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and founder of both CBS Corp. and
Viacom Inc. In addition, Ms. Shari Redstone, Mr. Sumner M. Redstone's daughter, is the president and a director of NAI and the vice chair of the board of directors of both CBS
Corp. and Viacom Inc. Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of CBS Corp. and serves as a director of NAI. Mr. Frederic V. Salerno is a director of CBS Corp. and serves as a director
of Viacom Inc. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information on the Company's relationship with NAI and Viacom Inc. At December 31,
2011, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79% of CBS Corp.'s voting Class A Common Stock and owned approximately 6% of CBS Corp.'s Class A Common Stock and
non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. 
         Viacom Inc.    As part of its normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with Viacom Inc. and its
subsidiaries.
Through its Entertainment segment, the Company licenses its television products to Viacom Inc., primarily MTV Networks and BET Networks. In addition, the Company recognizes revenues for
advertising spending placed by various subsidiaries of Viacom Inc., primarily Paramount Pictures. Viacom Inc. also distributes certain of the Company's television products in the home
entertainment market. The Company's total revenues from these transactions were $255 million, $262 million and $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. 
        The
Company places advertisements with, and leases production facilities, licenses programming and purchases other goods and services from various subsidiaries of Viacom Inc. The
total amounts for these transactions were $23 million, $27 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

         Other Related Parties    The Company has equity interests in a domestic television network and several
international joint ventures for television channels, from which the Company earns revenues primarily by selling its television programming. Total revenues earned from these joint ventures were
$133 million, $145 million and $132 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
        The
Company, through the normal course of business, is involved in other transactions with related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented. 
 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 Goodwill Impairment Testing  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance on goodwill impairment testing. Under this guidance,
the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If based on
this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment
test is unnecessary. 
 Disclosures about an Employer's Participation in a Multiemployer Plan  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance which requires separate disclosures about an employer's
participation in multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefit plans as well as enhanced disclosures about multiemployer pension plans. 
 Comprehensive Income  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under
this guidance, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income must be presented either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
Upon adoption, the Company elected to present two separate consecutive statements. 
II-38



 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  
        On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted revised FASB guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance
revises the criteria for separating and allocating consideration for each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of each
deliverable. Under the guidance, revenues are allocated based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on the Company-specific
objective evidence if available, third party evidence if Company-specific evidence is not available, or estimated selling price for the stand-alone sale of the deliverable if neither Company-specific
objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 Recent Pronouncements  
 Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities  
        In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires disclosure of both gross and net information about financial instruments and
derivative instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet as well as financial instruments and derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement regardless of whether they are
offset. The adoption of this guidance, which is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. 
 Fair Value Measurement  
        In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
2012. This guidance clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changes certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

    MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     
        Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of
assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the framework set forth in  Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. 
        The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

        In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBS Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
        As
discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for transfers of financial assets in 2010. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  
 1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
         Description of BusinessCBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS
Corp.") is comprised of the following segments: Entertainment (CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television
Distribution; CBS Films; and CBS Interactive), Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks), Publishing (Simon & Schuster), Local Broadcasting (CBS Television
Stations and CBS Radio) and Outdoor (CBS Outdoor, comprised of Outdoor Americas and Outdoor Europe). 
         Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBS Corp. and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling
interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights. Investments over which the Company has a
significant influence or ownership of more than 20% but less than or equal to 50%, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments of 20% or less, over which the
Company has no significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method if the fair value is not readily determinable and are accounted for as available for sale securities if the fair value is
readily determinable. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
         ReclassificationsCertain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. 
        Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("U.S.") requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
        Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term (maturities of three months or less at the date
of purchase) highly liquid investments, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits. 
         Programming InventoryThe Company acquires rights to programming and produces programming to exhibit on its broadcast and cable networks, broadcast
television and radio stations, and in theaters. The costs incurred in acquiring and producing programs and theatrical films are capitalized and amortized over the license period or projected useful
life of the programming. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable, and
the program is accepted and available for airing. 
        Television
and theatrical film production costs (which include direct production costs, production overhead and acquisition costs) are stated at the lower of amortized cost or net
realizable value. The Company then estimates total revenues to be earned and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. For television programming,
estimates for remaining total lifetime revenues are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market. Accordingly, television programming costs and participation
costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market are expensed as incurred on an episode by 
II-48



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
episode
basis. Estimates for all secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication, basic cable, digital streaming, home entertainment and merchandising are included in the estimated
lifetime revenues of such television programming once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. Television programming costs incurred subsequent to
the establishment of the secondary market are initially capitalized and amortized, and estimated liabilities for participations are accrued, based on the proportion that current period revenues bear
to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues. The costs incurred in acquiring television programs are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and expensed over the
period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Lifetime revenues estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for
the acquired programming are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to amortization rates and estimated accruals for participations. 
         Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over estimated
useful lives as follows: 











 Buildings
 
 20 to 40 years


 Leasehold Improvements
 
 Shorter of lease term or useful life


 Advertising Structures
 
 5 to 20 years


 Equipment and other (including capital leases)
 
 3 to 20 years




        Depreciation expense, including capitalized lease amortization, was $426 million (2011), $433 million (2010) and $449 million
(2009). Amortization expense related to capital leases was $19 million (2011) and $18 million (2010 and 2009). Accumulated amortization of capital leases was $132 million at
December 31, 2011 and $116 million at December 31, 2010. 
        Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by
comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by these assets to their net carrying value. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will generally be measured by the difference between the
net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset. 
        Impairment of InvestmentsInvestments are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing their fair value to their respective carrying
amounts. The Company determines the fair value of its public company investments by reference to their publicly traded stock price. With respect to private company investments, the Company makes its
estimate of fair value by considering recent investee equity transactions, discounted cash flow analyses, recent operating results, estimates based on comparable public company operating cash flow
multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values. If the fair value of the investment has dropped below the carrying amount, management considers several factors when determining
whether an other-than-temporary decline has occurred. These factors include the length of the time and the extent to which the estimated fair value or market value has been
below the carrying value, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the investee, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the investee for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and other factors influencing the fair market value, such as general market conditions. 
         Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the Company's operating segments.
Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of leasehold and franchise agreements, are generally amortized by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,
which range from 4 to 40 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets with 
II-49



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
indefinite
lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses and certain trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. If the carrying value of goodwill or the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized as a non-cash charge. 
         Other LiabilitiesOther liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, program
rights obligations, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals. 
        Discontinued OperationsCertain businesses that were previously disposed of by the
Company prior to January 1, 2002, were accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting rules in effect prior to 2002. Assets and liabilities remaining in discontinued
operations related to these businesses primarily include aircraft leases that are generally expected to liquidate in accordance with contractual terms. 
        During
2011, the Company reached favorable resolutions of certain contingencies related to its previously disposed businesses which are accounted for as discontinued operations. As a
result, a pre-tax gain of $23 million ($14 million, net of tax) was recorded in discontinued operations for the reversal of related accruals. 
         Revenue RecognitionAdvertising revenues, net of agency commissions, are recognized in the period during which advertising spots are aired or
displayed. If there is a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating, revenues are recognized for the actual audience rating delivered, based on the ratings data published by independent audience
ratings measurement companies. Revenues are deferred for any shortfall in the audience rating with respect to an advertising spot until such time as the required audience rating is delivered. Revenues
from the sale of outdoor advertising space are recognized ratably over the contract terms. 
        Revenues
from the licensing of television programming are recognized in the period that the television series is made available to the licensee, which may cause fluctuations in operating
results. Television series initially produced for networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently. The more successful network
series are later licensed to television stations, cable networks, certain additional international markets and for digital streaming. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary
depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production. Estimates for all secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication, basic cable, digital streaming, home
entertainment and merchandising are not included in the estimated lifetime revenues of a television series until it is demonstrated that the program can be successfully licensed in such secondary
market. 
        Affiliate
and subscription fees for cable and broadcast networks, television stations and online content are recognized in the period the service is provided. Costs for advertising and
marketing services provided to the Company by cable, satellite and other distributors are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
        Publishing
revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped. The Company records a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical trends which
allow for a percentage of revenue recognized. 
        Deferred
revenues primarily consist of revenues related to advertising arrangements and the licensing of television programming for which the revenues have not yet been earned. The
amounts classified as current are expected to be earned within the next twelve months. 
II-50



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
         Sales of Multiple Products or ServicesRevenues derived from a single sales contract that contains multiple products and services are allocated based
on the relative fair value of each delivered item and recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria for the specific unit of accounting. 
         Collaborative ArrangementsCollaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such
as television series and live sporting events, including the 14-year agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the NCAA
Division I Men's Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament"), which began in 2011. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on CBS
Television Network are recorded as revenues and the Company's share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses. 
        For
episodic television programming, co-production costs are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the television series' estimated economic life.
In such arrangements where the Company has distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators
are recorded as operating expenses. In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, the Company's net participating profits are recorded as
revenues. 
        Amounts
attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented. 
        AdvertisingAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred total advertising expenses of $400 million (2011),
$434 million (2010) and $314 million (2009). 
         InterestCosts associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of
its related debt. The Company may enter into interest rate exchange agreements; the amount to be paid or received under such agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an
adjustment to interest expense. 
        Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. The Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets and
establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. For tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or
expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the
technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the
amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing
tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. 
        Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionsThe Company's assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at foreign
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains or losses
are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated

other
comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have been included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
         Provision for Doubtful AccountsThe provision for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical bad debt experience, the aging of accounts
receivable, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as recent payment history for specific customers. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $30 million (2011),
$43 million (2010) and $47 million (2009). 
         Net Earnings (Loss) per Common ShareBasic earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") is based upon net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), market-based performance share
units ("PSUs") and restricted shares only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, stock options to purchase
21 million, 31 million and 32 million shares of Class B Common Stock, respectively, were outstanding but excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their
inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
        The
table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

         Company Common Stock Held by SubsidiariesCertain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company hold 179 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B
Common Stock, of which 47 million shares were repurchased shares and 132 million shares were issued by the Company to wholly owned subsidiaries. The 47 million repurchased shares
are reflected as treasury shares and the 132 million issued shares are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 Goodwill Impairment Testing  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") amended guidance on
goodwill impairment testing. Under this guidance, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount. If based on this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then
performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. (See Note 2.) 
 Disclosures about an Employer's Participation in a Multiemployer Plan  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance which requires separate disclosures about an employer's
participation in multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefit plans as well as enhanced disclosures about multiemployer pension plans. (See Note 12.) 
 Comprehensive Income  
        During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under
this guidance, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income must be presented either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
Upon adoption, the Company elected to present two separate consecutive statements. 
 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  
        On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted revised FASB guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance
revises the criteria for separating and allocating consideration for each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling 
II-53



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
price
of each deliverable. Under the guidance, revenues are allocated based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on the
Company-specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if Company-specific evidence is not available, or estimated selling price for the stand-alone sale of the deliverable if neither
Company-specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 Recent Pronouncements  
 Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities  
        In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires disclosure of both gross and net information about financial instruments and
derivative instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet as well as financial instruments and derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement regardless of whether they are
offset. The adoption of this guidance, which is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. 
 Fair Value Measurement  
        In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
2012. This guidance clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changes certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 2) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  
        The Company performs an annual fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily
comprised of FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. The
Company early adopted the FASB's amended guidance on goodwill impairment testing for its annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under this guidance, the Company may choose to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If based on this assessment the Company
determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. For 2011,
the Company performed this qualitative assessment for six reporting units that each had an estimated fair value for the 2010 annual impairment test that was in excess of its carrying value by 20% or
more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific
factors that were considered included the results of the most recent impairment tests, as well as financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent
impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the
industry during 2011, where applicable. The Company concluded that each of the 
II-54



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
reporting
unit specific and industry factors had either a positive or neutral impact on the fair value of each of the reporting units. The Company also determined that macroeconomic factors did not
have a significant impact on the discount rates and growth rates used for the 2010 annual impairment tests. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that for these six reporting
units, performing the two-step impairment test was unnecessary and no impairment charge was required for 2011. 
        The
Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining three reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test requires the Company to then compare the implied fair
value of that reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill to determine the amount of impairment charge, if any. 
        The
estimated fair value of each reporting unit for which step one of the impairment test is performed is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash
Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially
equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method includes the Company's assumptions for growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period plus the residual value of
the business at the end of the projection period. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company's internal forecasts of
future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and
long-term industry projections, and for 2011 was between 2.0% and 3.0%. The discount rates, which for 2011 ranged from 8.5% to 10.0%, are determined based on the average of the weighted
average cost of capital of comparable entities. Based on the 2011 annual impairment test, for each of the three reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the impairment test,
the estimated fair values exceeded the respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required. 
        FCC
licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset by market with its carrying value. The Company considers each
geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level
represent their highest and best use. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the
income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design,
lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows
of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall
advertising revenues in the relevant
geographic market, the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a
normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising
revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are similarly estimated based on industry-average data. The residual value is
calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is
determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry. For each television station and radio station, the discount rates used for
2011 were

8.0%
and 8.5%, respectively, and the perpetual nominal growth rates used were 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively. 
        Based
on the 2011 annual impairment test of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, the estimated fair values exceeded the respective carrying values and therefore no
impairment charge was required.

on the 2010 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying values
and therefore no impairment charge was required. 
        During
2009, as a result of the Company's annual impairment test of FCC licenses, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $178 million
at the Local Broadcasting segment to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. This impairment resulted from reductions in projections for advertising revenues due to a
weakened radio advertising marketplace. 
        Also
in 2009, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $32 million to
reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $21 million and the allocated goodwill by $11 million.

 3) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  
        During the year ended December 31, 2011, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring
plans, which primarily included relocation or closure of certain business activities, as well as other exit activities. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $46 million,
reflecting $34 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and $12 million of severance costs. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $81 million and $23 million, respectively. The charges reflected $87 million of severance costs and $22 million of contract termination
and other associated costs, partially offset by reversals of $5 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. As of December 31, 2011, the
cumulative amount paid for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 restructuring charges was $100 million, of which $81 million was for severance costs and $19 million was related to
contract

December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $4 million and
$1 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $75 million and $83 million,
respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $5.92 billion at December 31, 2011 and $5.94 billion at December 31, 2010.
(d)Included
in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

        At December 31, 2011, the Company classified $490 million of senior notes and debentures maturing in August 2012 as
long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. 
        For
the year ended December 31, 2010, debt issuances, redemptions and repurchases were as follows: 
 Debt Issuances

 Credit Facility  
        At December 31, 2011, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2015 (the
"Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined
at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior
unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. 
        The
Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0x at the end of each quarter and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the
trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 1.8x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio
was approximately 7.8x. 
        The
Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a
quarter, to the Company's Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before
depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash items. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's cash interest expense on
indebtedness, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, in each case for the trailing four consecutive quarters. 
        The
primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its
$2.0 billion commercial

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
paper
program. At December 31, 2011, the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.98 billion. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  
        The Company participated in a revolving accounts receivable securitization program, prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010,
which provided for the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company
reduced the amounts outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program to zero from $400 million at December 31, 2009 and terminated the program. 
        On
January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets which required the Company's securitized accounts receivables to
be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding increase to debt. As a result, the decrease to the accounts receivable securitization program of $400 million during 2010 is
reflected as cash flows used
for financing activities and the decrease of $150 million during 2009 is reflected as cash flows used for operating activities under previous FASB guidance. 
        During
the period before the termination of the program in 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of
$263 million and $1.47 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the program's accounts
receivables was $1 million for 2010 and $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 
 8) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
        The Company's carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value, except for differences with respect to notes and
debentures. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of the senior debt was $5.93 billion for both periods and the fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices
and includes accrued interest, was $6.86 billion and $6.54 billion, respectively. 
        The
Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company
does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
        Foreign
exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro,
the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar. The Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the
effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized.
Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the
non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $151 million which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. At
December 31, 2010, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $114 million, of which $2 million related to the hedging of future production costs and
$112 million represented hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. 
II-65



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
        All
of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2009, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating rate
swap agreements for a portion of its debt, which were designated as fair value hedges. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps were recorded as a change in the carrying value of the debt attributable
to the risk being hedged. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company settled all of its interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding during 2011 or
2010. 
        The
Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to
credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. 
        The
Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2011 and 2010, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic
areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.

 9) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
        The following tables set forth the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31,
2011 and 2010. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as
quoted

        The fair value of investments is determined based on publicly quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is
determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation is determined based on the fair
value of the investments elected by employees. 
 10) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  
        In general, CBS Corp. Class A Common Stock and CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock have the same economic rights, except
voting rights. Holders of CBS Corp. Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to all matters on which the holders of CBS Corp. Common Stock are entitled to vote.
Holders of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law. 
         DividendsThe Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of
2011, 2010, and 2009, resulting in total annual dividends of $237 million, $139 million and $136 million, respectively. Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional
paid-in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance. 
         Purchase of Company StockDuring 2011, the Company repurchased 42.2 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for
$1.02 billion under its share repurchase program. At December 31, 2011, there was $1.98 billion of authorization remaining under the repurchase program. 
        Conversion RightsHolders of Class A Common Stock have the right to convert their shares to Class B Common Stock as long as there are at
least 5,000 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. 
II-67



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
Conversions
of CBS Corp. Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were .2 million for 2011, 8 million for 2010 and 6 million for 2009. 
         Equity Incentive PlansThe Company has equity incentive plans (the "Plans") under which stock options, stock option equivalents, RSUs and PSUs were
issued. 
        The
purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of the Company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their
contributions to the financial success of the Company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, phantom shares, dividend
equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs, the Company issues new shares from its existing authorization. At
December 31, 2011 there were 40 million shares available for future grant under the Plans. 
 RSUs and PSUs  
        Compensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and
expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a one- to four-year service period. Certain RSU awards are also subject to satisfying performance conditions. Once the
Company determines that it is probable that the performance targets will be met, compensation expense is recorded for these awards. Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on
historical forfeiture rates. On an annual basis, the Company adjusts the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revises the forfeiture rate, as necessary. 
        The
Company also grants awards of PSUs which vest based on the achievement of market performance targets. The number of shares that will be issued upon vesting of PSUs can range from 0%
to 300% of the target award, based on the ranking of the total shareholder return ("TSR") for CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock within the S&P 500 Index over a designated
three-year measurement period, or in certain circumstances, based on the achievement of established operating performance goals. The fair value of the PSUs is determined using a Monte
Carlo Simulation model. This model generates simulated TSR of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock versus each of the companies in the S&P 500 Index through the end of the relevant measurement
period. Compensation expense for PSUs is expensed over a three- to four-year service period. 
        Total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2011 was $152 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 2.3 years.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 Stock Options and Equivalents  
        Compensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes
options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a three- to four-year service period and generally expire eight to ten years from the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on
the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. On an annual basis, the Company adjusts the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revises the forfeiture rate as necessary. Stock
option equivalents are settled in cash upon exercise and therefore, the Company remeasures the fair value of these awards at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. At both
December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company had 2 million stock option equivalents outstanding. 
        The
weighted average fair value of stock options as of the grant date was $7.59, $4.97 and $2.41 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

 Expected term of options (years)

        The expected stock price volatility is determined using a weighted average of historical volatility for CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and
implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive
implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a
remaining term of greater than one year. 
        The
risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on
historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield represents the Company's future expectation of the dividend yield based on current rates and
historical patterns of dividend changes. 
        Total
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards and stock option equivalents at December 31, 2011 was $68 million, which is expected to be
expensed over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.

        In addition to the deferred income taxes reflected in the table above, the Company included net non-current deferred income tax assets
of $12 million and $11 million in "Assets of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of approximately $1.00 billion, the majority
of which expire in various years from 2012 through 2029. 
        The
2011 and 2010 deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of $341 million and $339 million, respectively, principally relating to income tax
benefits of net operating losses which are not expected to be realized. 
        The
Company's share of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not included in its consolidated federal income tax return that could be subject to additional income taxes if
remitted was approximately $3.25 billion at December 31, 2011 and $3.20 billion at December 31, 2010. No provision has been recorded for the U.S. or foreign taxes that
could result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings since the Company intends to distribute only the portion of such earnings which would be offset by U.S. foreign tax credits or remitted
in a tax-free transaction, and intends to reinvest the remainder outside the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of unrecognized U.S. federal deferred income tax liability
for undistributed earnings is not practicable.

        At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $54 million and $56 million, respectively, of the reserve for uncertain tax positions were
included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
        The
reserve for uncertain tax positions of $195 million at December 31, 2011 includes $158 million which would affect the Company's effective income tax rate if and
when recognized in future years. 
        The
Company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
the Company recognized interest and penalties of $12 million, $11 million and $16 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the Company has recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of $61 million and $59 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
        The
Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010. In addition, various tax years are currently under examination by state and
local, and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, the Company does not currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax
positions will significantly change within the next twelve months; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and accordingly,
unforeseen events could cause the Company's current expectation to change in the future. 
 12) PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  
        The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally
non-contributory, covering eligible employees. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of certain previously divested businesses. Most of 
II-73



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
the
Company's pension plans are closed to new entrants. The benefits for certain plans are based primarily on an employee's years of service and average pay near retirement. Benefits under other plans
are based primarily on an employee's pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. Participating employees are vested in the plans after five years of service. The Company funds its
pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"),
the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the applicable rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities and U.S.
government securities. The Company's common stock represents approximately 1.0% and .8% of the plan assets' fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        In
addition, the Company sponsors health and welfare plans that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered
dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such
as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually. Claims are paid primarily by the Company's funds. 
        The
Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

        The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows
necessary to meet each of the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived
using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. 
        The
following assumptions were also used in accounting for postretirement benefits.

 Plan Assets  
        The asset allocations for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan trust and international pension plan trusts are
based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for
the Company's U.S. pension plan trust, which accounted for 93% of total plan assets at December 31, 2011, is to invest between 70% - 80% in fixed income instruments,
16% - 28% in equity securities and the remainder in cash and other investments. At December 31, 2011, this trust was invested approximately 70% in long duration fixed income
instruments, 22% in equity instruments, 6% in cash and cash equivalents and the remainder in other investments. Other trusts, which fund the Company's international pension plans, accounted for 7% of
total plan assets at December 31, 2011 and are invested approximately 64% in fixed income instruments, 22% in equity instruments, 12% in cash and cash equivalents and the remainder in other
investments. Long duration fixed income investments primarily consist of a diversified portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments with a duration that approximates the duration of the
liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are
regularly reviewed. 
        The
following tables set forth the Company's pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 and 2010. These assets have been categorized
according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on quoted prices for the asset in active
markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in Level 1, such as quoted prices for the asset in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar
assets. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  
        Money market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments
in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments
in common collective funds are determined using the Net Asset Value ("NAV") provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is determined by each fund's trustee based upon the fair value of the
underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active
markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which
incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based
upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes and market information. Limited partnerships are valued using statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on
the fair value of the underlying investments.

        In
2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $55 million primarily to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these
plans. The Company, at its discretion, may make additional contributions in 2012 to pre-fund its qualified pension plans. Also in 2012, the Company 
II-80



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
expects
to contribute approximately $70 million to its other postretirement benefit plans, to satisfy the Company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans. 
 Multiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans  
        The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements
that cover its union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these
multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to
the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded
obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans it may be required to pay
those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan. 
        The
financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which represents the funded status of the plan as
certified by the plan's actuary. Plans in the red zone are less than 65% funded, the yellow zone are between 65% and 80% funded, and green zone are at least 80% funded. 
        The

        Future
minimum operating lease payments have been reduced by future minimum sublease income of $92 million. Rent expense was $601 million (2011), $594 million (2010)
and $617 million (2009). 
 Guarantees  
        The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against
non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $389 million and were not recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
        Prior
to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to
obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases
related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and
Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties. 
        In
the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the
Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification
obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Legal Matters  
         Securities Action.    On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and
Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and
October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
timely
write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages.
On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System
(collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs
filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive Chairman. On July 13, 2009, all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On
March 16, 2010, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed this action as to the Company and all defendants. On April 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to serve
an amended complaint. On September 23, 2010, the court issued an order granting leave to amend. On October 8, 2010, the Company was served with an Amended Complaint, which redefines the
Class Period to be April 29, 2008 to October 10, 2008 and alleges that the impairment charge should have been taken during the first quarter of 2008. The Company filed a motion to
dismiss this Amended Complaint on November 19, 2010. On May 24, 2011, the court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of defendants on May 25, 2011. On
June 23, 2011, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
        CBS Outdoor and London Underground Actions.    Beginning in 2010, CBS Outdoor Limited filed legal proceedings and claims against London
Underground
Limited with respect to disputes arising under the 2006 transit contract between the parties, and London Underground Limited filed counterclaims with respect to its claims. In December 2011, the
parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving these matters, which is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. CBS Outdoor Limited continues to operate the London
Underground advertising concession. 
         E-books Actions.    Commencing on August 9, 2011, purported class action complaints have been filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California regarding the sale of electronic books
pursuant to agency distribution arrangements. On August 16, 2011, a motion was filed with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL Panel") by certain parties
seeking to consolidate these actions for pre-trial proceedings in one venue. On December 9, 2011, the MDL Panel issued an order consolidating the actions in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against Apple Inc., Hachette
Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., Macmillan Publishers, Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Company's subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc.
The plaintiffs, electronic book purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and/or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of electronic books
pursuant to agency distribution arrangements between each of the publishers and electronic book retailers. The actions generally seek multiple forms of damages for the purchase of electronic books and
injunctive and other relief. Simon & Schuster intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions. In addition, certain federal and state governmental entities in the United States and the
competition authority in the European Community are conducting competition investigations of agency distribution arrangements in this industry and Simon & Schuster is cooperating with these
competition investigations. 
        Indecency Regulation.    In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the
Company's owned
television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the
Company's television stations (the "Super Bowl Proceeding"). In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for 
II-84



 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
Review
of the forfeiture with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument
was heard in September 2007. In July 2008, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed
a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision. The petition requested that the United States Supreme Court not act on the petition
until it ruled in the "fleeting expletives case" mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCC's petition for certiorari. 
        In
another case involving broadcasts on another network, in June 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the
broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC (the "fleeting expletives case"). On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted the
FCC's petition to review the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision. On November 4, 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard argument in this case. On
April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision reversing the Second Circuit's judgment on administrative grounds in
favor of the FCC and remanding the fleeting expletives case to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit requested additional briefing and argument was heard on January 13, 2010. On
July 13, 2010, the Second Circuit struck down an FCC policy on indecency and found that the FCC's indecency policies and decisions regarding the use of "fleeting expletives" on radio and
television violated the First Amendment. On August 25, 2010, the FCC filed a petition for rehearing en banc and, on August 31, 2010, the Second Circuit issued an order directing all
parties and intervenors to file briefs in response to the FCC's petition on September 21, 2010, which were filed. On November 22, 2010, the Second Circuit denied the FCC's petition for
rehearing. On April 21, 2011, the FCC filed a combined petition for certiorari seeking review of the Second Circuit's decision in this case and also in an indecency case involving a broadcast
on another television network. On June 27, 2011, the United States Supreme Court granted the FCC's petition for certiorari. On January 10, 2012, the United States Supreme Court heard
oral argument in these cases. 
        Following
the April 28, 2009 decision in the fleeting expletives case, on May 4, 2009, the United States Supreme Court remanded the Super Bowl Proceeding to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and requested supplemental briefing from the Company and the FCC, in light of the United States Supreme Court's fleeting expletives decision. Argument was
heard by the Third Circuit in the Super Bowl Proceeding on February 23, 2010. On May 18, 2010 and on December 22, 2010, at the Third Circuit's request, the Company and the FCC
each submitted supplemental briefs. On November 2, 2011, the Third Circuit upheld its earlier decision to vacate the FCC's order to have the Company pay the $550,000 forfeiture. 
        In
March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC
proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations.
The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures. 
        Additionally,
the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the
Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material. 
         Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.    The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to
asbestos and
other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse
was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
Company
is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's
products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in
turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos-containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. 
        Claims
are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from
period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no
impairment. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had pending approximately 50,090 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 52,220 as of December 31, 2010 and 62,360 as of
December 31, 2009. During 2011, the Company received approximately 4,410 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 6,540 claims. The Company reports claims as closed
when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on
the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2011 and 2010 for settlement
and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $33 million and $14 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and
defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
        The
Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of
outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of
asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the
number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities. 
         Other.    The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities
asserting that it is
or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives
personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. 
        General.    On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various
investigations and
inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict.
However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are
not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and
Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

        The
Company presents segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges" or "Segment OIBDA" if there is
no impairment charge) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment
OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management
and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance.
