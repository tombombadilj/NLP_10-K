FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011


PART I


ITEM 1.                 BUSINESS


General


Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries (”we,” “our,” “us,” “Atrion,” or the “Company”) develop and manufacture products, primarily for medical applications. Our medical products range from fluid delivery devices to ophthalmic and cardiovascular products.
 
Our fluid delivery products accounted for 38 percent, 36 percent and 35 percent of net revenues for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These products include proprietary valves that promote infection control and needle safety. We have developed a wide variety of luer syringe check valves and one-way valves designed to fill, hold and release controlled amounts of fluids or gasses on demand for use in various intubation, catheter and other applications. We also make tubing clamps in a variety of materials and colors that are compatible with various grades of tubing and sterilization processes, and produce specialized intravenous sets for use in numerous applications including anesthesia and oncology.
 
Our cardiovascular products accounted for 29 percent of our net revenues for each of 2011, 2010 and 2009. At the heart of our cardiovascular products is the MPS2® Myocardial Protection System, or MPS2, a proprietary technology that delivers essential fluids and medications to the heart during open-heart surgery. The MPS2 integrates key functions relating to the delivery of solutions to the heart, such as varying the rate and ratio of oxygenated blood, crystalloid, potassium and other additives, and controlling temperature, pressure and other variables to allow simpler, more flexible management of this process, indicating improved patient outcomes. The MPS2 is the only device used in open-heart surgery that allows for the mixing of drugs into the bloodstream without diluting the blood. The MPS2 employs advanced pump, temperature control and microprocessor technologies and includes a line of disposable products. We also develop and manufacture other cardiovascular products such as cardiac surgery vacuum relief valves; silicone vessel loops for retracting and occluding vessels in minimally invasive surgical procedures; inflation devices for balloon catheter dilation, stent deployment and fluid dispensing; as well as products used in heart bypass surgery to make a precision opening in the heart for attachment of the bypass vessels.
 
Our ophthalmic products accounted for 17 percent, 18 percent and 19 percent of our net revenues for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We are a leading manufacturer of contact lens disinfection cases. We also manufacture a proprietary line of balloon catheters used in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children and adults. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction can cause a condition called epiphora, or chronic tearing. People affected by this condition experience excessive and uncontrollable tearing and often encounter infection as a result of nasolacrimal blockage. Our balloon catheters are the only balloon catheters with United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval for use in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
 
Our other medical and non-medical products accounted for 16 percent, 17 percent and 17 percent of our net revenues for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. One of these product lines consists of instrumentation and associated disposables used to measure the activated clotting time of blood. In addition, we manufacture and sell a line of products designed for safe needle and scalpel blade containment. We are also the leading manufacturer of inflation systems and valves used in marine and aviation safety products. We manufacture inflation systems and valves for products such as life vests, life rafts, inflatable boats, survival equipment, and other inflatable structures. We also produce one-way and two-way pressure relief valves for use on electronics cases, munitions cases, pressure vessels, transportation container cases, escape slides, and many other medical and non-medical applications

Marketing and Major Customers
 
We market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians, hospitals, clinics and other treatment centers. We sell our products through a sales force which consists of direct sales personnel, independent sales representatives and distributors.  Our sales managers also work closely with major customers in designing and developing products to meet customer requirements.


Our net revenues from sales to customers outside the United States totaled approximately 42 percent, 40 percent and 39 percent of our net revenues for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our international sales are made to various manufacturers and through distributors in over 60 countries.  Revenues from sales to customers in Canada totaled approximately 15 percent, 16 percent and 15 percent of our net revenues for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additional information about our revenues from customers in and outside of the United States over the past three years is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.


We offer customer service, training and education, and technical support such as field service, spare parts, maintenance and repair for certain of our products. We periodically advertise our products in trade journals, routinely attend and participate in industry trade shows throughout the United States and internationally, and sponsor scientific symposia as a means of disseminating product information. We may provide supportive literature on the benefits of our products.


During 2011, Novartis International AG was our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our revenues, with sales of various of our products to several divisions of Novartis accounting for approximately 13 percent of our net revenues.


Manufacturing


Our medical products and other components are produced at facilities in Florida, Alabama and Texas. The facilities in Alabama and Florida both utilize plastic injection molding and specialized assembly as their primary manufacturing processes. Our other manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of standard and custom component parts, including the assembly of electronic components, and the testing of completed products.


We are subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain design testing, quality control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. We devote significant attention to quality assurance. Our quality assurance measures begin with the suppliers which participate in our supplier quality assurance program. These measures continue at the manufacturing level where many components are assembled in a clean room environment designed and maintained to reduce product exposure to particulate matter. Products are tested throughout the manufacturing process for adherence to specifications. Most finished products are then shipped to outside processors for sterilization by radiation or ethylene oxide gas. After sterilization, the products are quarantined and tested before they are shipped to customers.


Skilled workers are required for the manufacturing of our products, and we believe that additional workers with these skills are readily available in the areas where our plants are located.


Our medical device operations are ISO13485:2003 certified and are subject to FDA jurisdiction. Our non-medical device operations are ISO9001-2008 certified.

Research and Development


A well-targeted research and development program is an essential part of our activities, and we are currently engaged in a number of research and development projects. The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional research and development in 2012 in all these areas.


Our consolidated research and development expenditures for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $2,868,000, $2,669,000, and $3,054,000, respectively.


Sources and Availability of Raw Materials


The principal raw materials that we use in our products are resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in large part, on the availability and pricing of these resins. The resins we use are derived from petroleum and natural gas, and the prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand and the capacity of the companies that produce these resins to meet market needs. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the availability and pricing of these resins.


We contract with various suppliers to provide the component parts necessary to assemble our products. Almost all of these components are available from a number of different suppliers, although certain components are purchased from single sources that manufacture these components using our tooling. We believe that there are satisfactory alternative sources for single-sourced components, although a sudden disruption in supply from one or more of these suppliers could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time. We own the molds used for production of nearly all our components. Consequently, in the event of supply disruption, we should be able to fabricate our own components or contract with another supplier, albeit after a possible delay in the production process.


Patents and License Agreements


Our commercial success is dependent, in part, on our ability to continue to develop patentable products, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of third parties. We currently have 360 active patents and patent applications pending on products that are either being sold or are in development. We pay royalties to outside parties for four patents. All of these patents and patents pending relate to products currently being sold by us or to products in evaluation stages.  Our patents expire at various times over the next 18 years.


We have developed technical knowledge which, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. However, the proprietary nature of such knowledge may be difficult to protect. We have entered into agreements with key employees prohibiting them from disclosing any of our confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, these agreements also provide that any inventions or discoveries relating to our business by these individuals will be assigned to us and become our sole property.


The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and companies in that industry sometimes use intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is often complex and expensive, and the outcome of this litigation is generally difficult to predict.


Competition


Depending on the product and the nature of the project, we compete on the basis of our ability to provide engineering and design expertise, quality, service, product and price. As such, successful competitors must have technical strength, responsiveness and scale. We believe that our expertise and reputation for quality medical products have allowed us to compete favorably with respect to each such factor and to maintain long-term relationships with our customers.

In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, HMOs and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.


We design products for a customer or potential customer prior to entering into long-term development and manufacturing agreements with that customer. Because these products are somewhat limited in number and normally are only a component of the ultimate product sold by our customers, we are dependent on our ability to meet the quality requirements of those major healthcare companies and must continually be attentive to the need to manufacture such products at competitive prices and in compliance with strict manufacturing standards. Additionally, we are dependent on our customer’s success in the marketing of the ultimate product sold. We also compete in the market for inflation devices used in marine and aviation equipment.



Government Regulation



Products


The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to regulation by numerous United States governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding foreign agencies. The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are governed by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical products subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA.


The FDA has traditionally pursued a rigorous enforcement program to ensure that regulated entities comply with the FDCA. The FDA has recently been increasing its scrutiny of the medical device industry, and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely.  A company not in compliance may face a variety of regulatory actions, including warning letters, product detentions, device alerts, mandatory recalls or field corrections, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, injunctive actions or civil penalties and criminal prosecutions of the company or responsible employees, officers and directors. We and certain of our customers are subject to these inspections.


The FDA sets forth rules, which are available to the public, for the approval of medical devices. The process of obtaining FDA approval for new devices can take several months to several years depending on the type of application required for a particular device. Furthermore, the process of obtaining FDA approval can be expensive and uncertain. Even if granted, FDA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. FDA enforcement policy strictly regulates the promotion of approved medical devices. Product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing. We are also subject to regulation in certain foreign countries where we sell our products. Some of the regulations in these countries that are applicable to our products are similar to those of the FDA.

Certain aviation and marine safety products are also subject to regulation by the United States Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration and similar organizations in foreign countries which regulate the safety of marine and aviation equipment.


Third-Party Reimbursement and Cost Containment


In the United States, healthcare providers, including hospitals and physicians, that purchase medical products for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors, principally Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to reimburse all or a part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed using these products.


Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Market acceptance of our products in international markets depends, in part, on the availability and level of reimbursement.


Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals is generally based on a fixed amount for a patient based upon that patient’s specific diagnosis. Because of this fixed reimbursement method, hospitals may seek to reduce the costs they incur in treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Frequently, reimbursement is reduced to reflect the availability of a new procedure or technique, and as a result hospitals are generally willing to implement new cost saving technologies before these downward adjustments take effect. Likewise, because the rate of reimbursement for physicians who perform certain procedures has been and may in the future be reduced, physicians may seek greater cost efficiency in treatment to minimize any negative impact of reduced reimbursement. Third-party payors may challenge the prices charged for medical products and services and may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, was experimental or was used for an unapproved application.


In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act”) was enacted. Among other provisions, this legislation imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale in the United States of certain medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer after December 31, 2012. The Affordable Care Act also includes numerous provisions to limit Medicare spending through reductions in various fee schedule payments and by instituting more sweeping payment reforms, such as bundled payments for episodes of care and the establishment of “accountable care organizations” under which hospitals and physicians will be able to share savings that result from cost control efforts and imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for medical device manufacturers effective March 30, 2013. Many of these provisions will be implemented through the regulatory process, and many policy details have not yet been finalized. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level.


We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess healthcare reform, including alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. We cannot predict what impact the adoption or modification of any federal or state healthcare reform measures, including the Affordable Care Act, and state healthcare reform, future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business.


Fraud and Abuse Laws


We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Violation of these laws can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies.

Product Liability and Insurance


The design, manufacture and marketing of products of the types we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A problem with one of our products could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert or advisory notice relating to, the product. We have product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate.


Advisory Board


Several physicians and other healthcare professionals serve as our clinical advisors. These clinical advisors have assisted in the identification of the market need for some of our products. Members of our management and scientific and technical staff from time to time consult with these clinical advisors to better understand the technical and clinical requirements of current and future products. We anticipate that these clinical advisors will continue to play a role in our development activities.


Certain of the clinical advisors are employed by academic institutions and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to advise us. The clinical advisors may also serve as consultants to other medical device companies. Our clinical advisors are not expected to devote more than a small portion of their time in providing services to us.


People


At January 31, 2012, we had 458 full-time employees. We are proud that many of our employees have tenures with us ranging from 10 to 30 years.

ITEM 1A.                      RISK FACTORS


In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial, or that we have not predicted, may also harm our business operations or adversely affect us.






  


·


The loss of a key supplier of raw materials could lead to increased costs and lower profit margins.



The loss of a key supplier would force us to purchase raw materials in the open market, which may be at higher prices, until we could secure another source and such higher prices may not allow us to remain competitive. If we are unable to obtain raw materials in sufficient quantities, we may not be able to manufacture our products. Even if we were able to replace one of our raw material suppliers through another supply arrangement, there is no assurance that the terms that we enter into with such alternate supplier will be as favorable as the supply arrangements that we currently have.
 




  


·


Our sales could decline materially if we lost business from one or more of our larger customers or a significant number of our smaller customers.



Our sales are generally made under open short-term purchase orders or purchase contracts.  Customers with purchase orders could reduce their volumes, or cease purchasing our products, with minimal notice.  Customers having purchase contracts may elect not to renew those contracts at expiration or the contracts may be renewed on terms less favorable to us.  The loss of, or material reduction in orders by, one or more of our larger customers or a significant number of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.






  


·


Product liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.



We may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award in the event of a claim. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. Also, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem with one or more of our products could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products.






  


·


Our business is dependent on the price and availability of resins and our ability to pass on resin price increases to our customers.



The principal raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in large part, on the availability and pricing of these resins. The resins we use are derived from petroleum and natural gas; therefore, prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand and the capacity of the companies that produce these products to meet market needs. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the prices of these raw materials and their availability.


Our ability to maintain profitability is heavily dependent upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs. If resin prices increase and we are not able to fully pass on the increases to our customers, our results of operations and our financial condition will be adversely affected.
 


  


-7-





  


 




  


·


Any losses we incur as a result of our exposure to the credit risk of our customers could harm our results of operations.



 
We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting credit arrangements, seek to limit credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. As we have grown our revenue and customer base, our exposure to credit risk has increased. Any material losses as a result of customer defaults could harm and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.






  


·


Our success is measured in part by our ability to develop patentable products, to preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of third parties.



Others may challenge the validity of any patents issued to us, and we could encounter legal and financial difficulties in enforcing our patent rights against infringers. In addition, there can be no assurance that other technologies cannot or will not be developed or that patents will not be obtained by others which would render our patents less valuable or obsolete. Our patents expire at various times over the next 18 years. Once patents expire, some customers may not continue to purchase from us, opting for competitive copies instead. If we do not develop and launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products, our sales and profits could decline substantially.


We have developed technical knowledge which, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. However, the proprietary nature of such knowledge may be difficult to protect.


The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and companies in the medical products industry sometimes use intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is often complex and expensive, and the outcome of this litigation is generally difficult to predict. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties or pay royalties that may be substantial. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.






  


·


International patent protection is uncertain.



Patent law outside the United States is uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our or our competitors’ foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.






  


·


New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.



From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

·


Some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and it may be difficult for us to compete against them.



In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies that have substantially greater financial resources and engage in substantially more research and development activities than we do. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products.


Some of the markets in which we compete are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than we do. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations.  In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.






  


·


We are subject to substantial governmental regulation and our failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could subject us to numerous penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business.




We are subject to numerous governmental regulations relating to, among other things, our ability to sell our products, third-party reimbursement and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. If we do not comply with applicable governmental regulations, governmental authorities could do one or more of the following:




  


·


impose fines and penalties on us;

 






  


·


prevent us from manufacturing our products;

 






  


·


bring civil or criminal charges against us;

 






  


·


delay the introduction of our new products into the market;

 






  


·


recall or seize our products;

 






  


·


exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;







  


·


disrupt the manufacture or distribution of our products; or

 






  


·


withdraw or deny approvals for our products.

 



 
Any one of these actions could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability and harm our reputation.






  


·


We will be unable to sell our products if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations.



To manufacture our products commercially, we must comply with governmental manufacturing regulations that govern design controls, quality systems and documentation policies and procedures, including continued compliance with QSR. The FDA and equivalent foreign governmental authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our OEM medical device customers. If we or our OEM medical device customers fail to comply with these manufacturing regulations, including meeting our reporting obligations to the FDA, or fail any FDA inspections, marketing or distribution of our products may be prevented or delayed, which would negatively impact our business.

·


Our products are subject to product recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, and any such recalls would negatively affect our financial performance and could harm our reputation.



Any of our products may be found to have significant deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of any such defective product. A government-mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects. We do not maintain insurance to cover losses incurred as a result of product recalls. Any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and negatively affect our financial performance, and could harm our reputation with customers and end-users.






  


·


We may not receive regulatory approvals for new product candidates or for modifications of existing products or approvals may be delayed.



Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. Any failure to receive the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates, or the subsequent withdrawal of any such approvals, would harm our business. Additionally, modification of our existing products may require regulatory approval. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with federal and state statutes and regulations require spending substantial time and financial resources. If we fail to obtain or maintain, or encounter delays in obtaining or maintaining, regulatory approvals, it could adversely affect the marketing of any products we develop or modify, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources.






  


·


We rely on technology to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business.



We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business, enhance customer service and increase employee productivity. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, inventory, manufacturing and other systems. There is no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by our policies and procedures that are intended to safeguard our systems. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.






  


·


We sell many of our products to healthcare providers that rely on Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans to reimburse the costs associated with the procedures performed using our products and these third party payors may deny reimbursement for use of our products.



We are dependent, in part, upon the ability of healthcare providers to obtain satisfactory reimbursement from third-party payors for medical procedures in which our products are used. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed product has not received appropriate regulatory clearances or approvals, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for procedures utilizing our products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Major third-party payors for medical services in the United States and other countries continue to work to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to charges for services performed. Further implementation of legislative or administrative reforms to the United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our products or denies coverage for such procedures may result in hospitals or physicians substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented could also have a negative impact on the demand for our products.

·


Healthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the United States healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



The Affordable Care Act makes changes that may significantly impact the medical device industry.  One of the principal aims of the Affordable Care Act as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured.  The consequences of a significant coverage expansion on the sales of our products are unknown and speculative at this point.


The Affordable Care Act, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to develop or market our products successfully.  The 2.3 percent excise tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act on sales in the United States of certain medical devices beginning in 2013 and the expansion of the government's role in the United States healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.






  


·


We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.



Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities we engage in can be intense, and we may not be able to hire qualified people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.







·


We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, which subjects us to risks that could harm our business.




We have strategic relationships with a number of distributors for sales of our products. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues could be adversely affected. Also, we may be named as a defendant in litigation against our distributors related to sales of our products by them.







·


Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.




We currently conduct all our development, manufacturing and management at three locations. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events at any one or more of these locations could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. We have the ability to transfer certain products from a facility affected by such events, but doing so would be expensive. Our disaster recovery policies and procedures may not be effective and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses.






  


·


Our stock price can be volatile.



Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:
 


  


-11-





  


 




  


·


actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;







  


·


recommendations by securities analysts;







  


·


operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;







  


·


perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and our competitors;







  


·


new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;







  


·


trading by funds with high-turnover practices or strategies;







  


·


significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or our competitors;







  


·


failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;







  


·


changes in government regulations; and







  


·


geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.





Additionally, our public float is small which can result in large fluctuations in stock price during periods with increased selling or buying activity. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.






  


·


Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.



We are increasing our presence in international markets, which subjects us to many risks, such as:




  


·


economic or political problems that disrupt foreign healthcare payment systems;







  


·


the imposition of governmental controls;







  


·


less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;







  


·


protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors;







  


·


the inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;







  


·


changes in tax laws and tariffs; and







  


·


longer payment cycles.



 
Our operations and marketing practices are also subject to regulation and scrutiny by the governments of the other countries in which we operate. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits United States companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In certain countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we are subject to other United States laws in our international operations. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.






  


·


A significant portion of our sales is to customers in foreign countries. We may lose revenues, market share and profits due to exchange rate fluctuations and other factors related to our international business.




Our international business is subject to economic, political and regulatory uncertainties and risks that are unique to each area of the world. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the prices that our international customers are willing to pay and may put us at a price disadvantage compared to other competitors. Potentially volatile shifts in exchange rates may negatively affect our financial condition and operations. Because payments from our international customers are received primarily in United States dollars, an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive or less affordable, and therefore adversely affect our sales, in international markets.

·


We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.



We have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many factors, including:





·


demand for our products;







·


pricing decisions, and those of our competitors, including decisions to increase or decrease prices;







·


regulatory approvals for our products;







·


timing and levels of spending for research and development, sales and marketing;







·


timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by us or our competitors;







·


development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets;







·


tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;







·


shipping delays or interruptions;







·


customer credit holds;







·


timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees; and







·


ability to control our costs;












  


·


If we make acquisitions, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business.



We may acquire companies, products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business.  If we do so, we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel, operations, products or technologies and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses, any of which could harm our business.






  


·


Political and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.



Our business may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial markets, and changes in the overall demand for our products. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the levels of business activity of our customers. Uncertainty about current global political or economic conditions could cause businesses to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products.
 
The recent economic recession and the uncertainty in global economic conditions resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, currency and fixed income markets. Although conditions have improved somewhat, uncertainty about current global economic conditions continues to pose a risk as customers may postpone spending in response to restraints on credit or uncertainties regarding demand for their products or services. There could be additional effects on our business from these economic developments including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit, the inability of our customers to pay for or obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products.
 
Continued turbulence in the United States and international markets and economies could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

·


If we fail to manage our exposure to financial and securities market risk successfully, our operating results could be adversely impacted.



We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, credit markets and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes or to mitigate our investment risks.
 
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, our marketable investments are primarily investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in United States dollars. The Company’s cash-equivalents and investments may be subject to adverse changes in market value.






  


·


Provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.



Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the ownership of the Company or a change in our management.  In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a rights plan which is intended to provide our Board of Directors with flexibility in addressing any takeover attempt and give it an opportunity to negotiate a transaction that maximizes stockholder value.  However, the rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control of us even if the change in control would generally be beneficial to our stockholders.  We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Although a delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or of changes in our Board of Directors could be effective in improving stockholder value, they also carry a risk of causing the market price of our common stock to decline.

ITEM 7.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





Overview


We develop and manufacture products primarily for medical applications. We market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians, hospitals, clinics and other treatment centers. Our medical products primarily serve the fluid delivery, cardiovascular, and ophthalmology markets. Our other medical and non-medical products include instrumentation and disposables used in dialysis and valves and inflation devices used in marine and aviation safety products.  In 2011 approximately 42 percent of our sales were outside the United States.
 
Our products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. We encounter competition in all of our markets and compete primarily on the basis of product quality, price, engineering, customer service and delivery time.
 


  


-17-





  


 
Our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise. Research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs in niche markets that are large enough to provide meaningful increases in sales. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. We also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to make investment purchases, to repurchase stock and to pay dividends.
 
Our strategic objective is to further enhance our position in our served markets by:
 




  


·


Focusing on customer needs;







  


·


Expanding existing product lines and developing new products;







  


·


Maintaining a culture of controlling cost; and







  


·


Preserving and fostering a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure.





For the year ended December 31, 2011, we reported revenues of $117.7 million, operating income of $38.2 million and net income of $26.0 million.


Results of Operations


Our net income was $26.0 million, or $12.90 per basic and $12.82 per diluted share, in 2011, compared to net income of $21.0 million, or $10.38 per basic and $10.32 per diluted share, in 2010 and net income of $16.8 million, or $8.51 per basic and $8.36 per diluted share, in 2009. The 2009 results included a $643,000 net of tax settlement charge, or $0.32 per diluted share, related to the termination of our defined benefit pension plans. Revenues were $117.7 million in 2011, compared with $108.6 million in 2010 and $100.6 million in 2009. The 8 percent revenue increases in 2011 over 2010 and in 2010 over 2009 were generally attributable to higher sales volumes.

Our cost of goods sold was $57.7 million in each of 2011 and 2010 and $55.3 million in 2009.  Increased sales volume, increased material costs, and increased manufacturing overhead costs were the primary contributors to the 4 percent increase in cost of goods sold for 2010 over 2009.


Gross profit in 2011 increased $9.1 million to $60.0 million, compared with $50.9 million in 2010 and $45.3 million in 2009. Our gross profit was 51 percent of revenues in 2011, 47 percent of revenues in 2010 and 45 percent of revenues in 2009. The increases in gross profit percentage in each of 2011 and 2010 from the prior year were primarily due to a favorable product mix, improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost-savings projects.


Operating expenses were $21.8 million in 2011, compared with $19.9 million in 2010 and $20.3 million in 2009. In 2011 increases in general and administrative, or G&A, expenses and increases in research and development, or R&D, expenses were partially offset by decreases in selling expenses. G&A expenses increased $1.7 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily related to increased compensation and increased outside services. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative, executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees. R&D expenses increased $199,000 in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily related to increased compensation costs, increased supplies costs and increased outside services. R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of our R&D personnel as well as costs associated with regulatory matters.  In 2011, selling expenses decreased $43,000 primarily related to decreased compensation, advertising and promotional expenses.  Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, marketing, advertising and promotional expenses.

In 2010, decreases in selling expenses and R&D expenses were partially offset by increases in G&A expenses. R&D expenses decreased $385,000 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily related to decreased compensation costs and decreased outside services. In 2010, selling expenses decreased $282,000 primarily related to decreased compensation, advertising and promotional expenses. In 2010, G&A expenses increased $277,000 over 2009 G&A expenses. G&A expenses in 2009 included a $989,000 settlement charge related to the termination of our defined benefit pension plans. Excluding the 2009 pension termination settlement charge; G&A expenses in 2010 increased $1.3 million, primarily as a result of increased compensation costs and outside services.


Our operating income for 2011 was $38.2 million, compared with $31.0 million in 2010 and $25.0 million in 2009. Operating income was 32 percent of revenues for 2011, 29 percent of revenues for 2010 and 25 percent of revenues in 2009. The increase in gross profit partially offset by the increase in operating expenses described above was the major contributor to the operating income improvement in 2011 compared to the previous year. The increase in 2010 gross profit in addition to the decrease in operating expenses described above were the major contributors to the operating income improvement in 2010 compared to the previous year.


Our interest income for 2011 was $1.3 million compared with $1.0 million in 2010 and $578,000 in 2009. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to the increased level of cash and investments during 2011 and 2010. Results for 2011 and 2010 were also favorably impacted by investing in bonds with slightly longer maturities and higher yields.


Income tax expense in 2011 totaled $13.4 million, compared with $11.0 million in 2010 and $8.7 million in 2009. The effective tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 34.0 percent, 34.5 percent and 34.2 percent, respectively. Benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled $996,000 in 2011, $957,000 in 2010 and $491,000 in 2009. Benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $159,000 in 2011. Expenses from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $255,000 in 2010 and $143,000 in 2009. We expect our effective tax rate for 2012 to be approximately 34.5 percent.


In February 2012, we learned that a large customer with which we have a long-term contract had accumulated too large of an inventory of one of our products, which we anticipate will result in a significant reduction in shipments to that customer in 2012. Due to this and other factors, we expect our earnings for the full year of 2012 to decline by approximately 10 percent from 2011 levels. We believe that the bulk of this decline will occur in the first two quarters of 2012. We expect our earnings per share to return to double-digit annual growth in 2013.


Liquidity and Capital Resources


Effective October 1, 2011, our revolving credit facility with a money center bank was amended to increase the maximum principal amount of our revolving line of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million and to extend the termination date for advances under the revolving line of credit to October 1, 2016. The credit facility is to be utilized for the funding of operations and for major capital projects or acquisitions, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest that is payable monthly at 30-day, 60-day or 90-day LIBOR, as selected by us, plus one percent. From time to time prior to October 1, 2016 and assuming an event of default is not then existing, we can convert outstanding advances under the revolving line of credit to term loans with a term of up to two years. We had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at December 31, 2011 or at December 31, 2010. The credit facility contains various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. We believe that the bank providing the credit facility is highly-rated and that the entire $40.0 million under the credit facility is currently available to us. If that bank were unable to provide such funds, we believe that such inability would not impact our ability to fund operations.

At December 31, 2011, we had a total of $55.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, an increase of $13.6 million from December 31, 2010. The principal contributor to this increase was the cash generated by operating activities, which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and the payment of dividends.


Cash flows provided by operations of $30.7 million in 2011 were primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses less net changes in working capital items. Inventories were the primary contributors to the negative net change in working capital items. The change in inventories was primarily related to increased stocking levels necessary to mitigate a supplier risk, to assure uninterrupted deliveries and to ensure high customer service levels. In addition, in late 2011 we rescheduled a shipment from late 2011 until early 2012 at the request of a large customer with which we have a long-term contract. In February 2012 we learned that this customer had accumulated too large an inventory of one of our products, which we anticipate will result in a significant reduction in shipments to that customer.


At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $73.7 million, including $24.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $20.3 million in short-term investments. The $29.5 million increase in working capital during 2011 was primarily related to increases in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The net increase in cash and short-term investments was primarily related to amounts generated from operations. Working capital items consisted primarily of cash, accounts receivable, short-term investments, inventories and other current assets minus accounts payable, and other current liabilities.


Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $12.0 million in 2011, compared with $4.3 million in 2010 and $6.6 million in 2009. These expenditures were primarily for the addition of machinery and equipment. We expect 2012 capital expenditures, primarily machinery and equipment, to increase substantially over the average of the levels expended during each of the past three years.


We paid cash dividends totaling $3.7 million, $21.3 million and $2.6 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $6.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This dividend which totaled $12.1 million was paid on January 29, 2010. In December 2010, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This dividend which totaled $6.0 million was paid on December 23, 2010. We expect to fund future dividend payments with cash flows from operations.

In the current credit and financial markets, many companies are finding it difficult to gain access to capital resources. In spite of the current economic conditions, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, cash flows from operations and available borrowings of up to $40.0 million under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the foreseeable future. We believe that our strong financial position would allow us to access equity or debt financing should that be necessary. Additionally, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and investments, as a whole, will continue to increase in 2012.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.


Impact of Inflation


We experience the effects of inflation primarily in the prices we pay for labor, materials and services. Over the last three years, we have experienced the effects of moderate inflation in these costs. At times, we have been able to offset a portion of these increased costs by increasing the sales prices of our products. However, competitive pressures have not allowed for full recovery of these cost increases.


New Accounting Pronouncements


In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance in ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. Entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We have chosen to adopt this standard as of December 31, 2011, and it had no effect on our financial statements.


From time to time, new accounting standards updates applicable to us are issued by the FASB, which we will adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of recently issued standards updates that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.


Critical Accounting Policies


The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the preparation of these financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.


From time to time, we accrue legal costs associated with certain litigation. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law and other case-specific issues. We believe these accruals are adequate to cover the legal fees and expenses associated with litigating these matters. However, the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what we have projected.

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments.  On an ongoing basis, the collectability of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends, current economic factors and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts.  We evaluate the collectability of specific accounts and determine when to grant credit to our customers using a combination of factors, including the age of the outstanding balances, evaluation of customers’ current and past financial condition, recent payment history, current economic environment, and discussions with our personnel and with the customers directly. Accounts are written off when it is determined the receivable will not be collected. If circumstances change, our estimates of the collectability of amounts could be changed by a material amount.
 
We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the balance sheet. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not, do not establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted.
 
We assess the impairment of our long-lived identifiable assets, excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment as explained below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows. Although we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in our business plan could materially affect our evaluations. No such changes are anticipated at this time.


We assess goodwill for impairment pursuant to ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, or, at a minimum, on an annual basis by applying a fair value test.


During 2009, 2010 and 2011, none of our critical accounting policy estimates required significant adjustments. We did not note any material events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of long-lived assets were not recoverable.

 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
We are not exposed to material fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the payments from our international customers are received primarily in United States dollars.
 
Principal and Interest Rate Risk
 
Our cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments consist of money-market accounts and taxable high-grade corporate bonds. Our investment policy is to seek to manage these assets to achieve the goal of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns subject to established investment guidelines.  In general, the primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of and the return on the investment to fluctuate.
 
In recent years, there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage-backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments do not have significant risk of default or illiquidity. However, our cash equivalents and investments may be subject to adverse changes in market value.

Forward-looking Statements
 
Statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-K that are forward-looking are based upon current expectations, and actual results or future events may differ materially. Therefore, the inclusion of such forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that our objectives or plans will be achieved. Such statements include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding our research and development expenditures in 2012, our 2012 effective tax rate, our ability to obtain component parts in the event of a supply disruption, shipments in 2012 to a large customer which had excess inventory at the end of 2011, earnings in 2012, a return to double-digit annual growth in earnings per share in 2013, our 2012 capital expenditures, funding future dividend payments with cash flows from operations, availability of equity and debt financing, our ability to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, our ability to fund operations if the bank providing our credit facility were unable to lend funds to us, the impact on our consolidated financial statement of recently issued accounting standards when we adopt those standards, and increases in 2012 in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Words such as “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “should,” “plans,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained herein involve numerous risks and uncertainties, and there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ materially, including, but not limited to, the following: changing economic, market and business conditions; acts of war or terrorism; the effects of governmental regulation; the impact of competition and new technologies; slower-than-anticipated introduction of new products or implementation of marketing strategies; implementation of new manufacturing processes or implementation of new information systems; our ability to protect our intellectual property; changes in the prices of raw materials; changes in product mix; intellectual property and product  liability claims and product recalls; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and the loss of any significant customers. In addition, assumptions relating to budgeting, marketing, product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic review which may cause us to alter our marketing, capital expenditures or other budgets, which in turn may affect our results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 8.          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 


Board of Directors and Stockholders
Atrion Corporation


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atrion Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Atrion Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material aspects, the information set forth therein.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Atrion Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated March 12, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Atrion Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 

Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Atrion” or the “Company”) develop and manufacture products primarily for medical applications. We market our products throughout the United States and internationally.  Our customers include hospitals, distributors, and other manufacturers.  Atrion Corporation’s principal subsidiaries through which these operations are conducted are Atrion Medical Products, Inc., Halkey-Roberts Corporation and Quest Medical, Inc.


Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.


Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include cash on hand and in the bank as well as money market accounts and debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.


Trade Receivables
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the original sales price to the customer.  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments.  On an ongoing basis, the collectability of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends, current economic factors and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts.  We evaluate the collectability of specific accounts and determine when to grant credit to our customers using a combination of factors, including the age of the outstanding balances, evaluation of customers’ current and past financial condition, recent payment history, current economic environment, and discussions with appropriate Company personnel and with the customers directly.  Accounts are written off when we determine the receivable will not be collected.


Investments
Our investments consist of taxable high-grade corporate bonds. Our investment policy is to seek to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. We are required to classify our investments as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Our investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity since we have the positive intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity. These investments are reported at cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income, using a method that approximates the effective interest method, over the period to maturity and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings. We consider as current assets those investments which will mature in the next 12 months. The remaining investments are considered non-current assets.

Accounts Payable
We reflect disbursements as trade accounts payable until such time as payments are presented to our bank for payment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, disbursements totaling approximately $155,000 and $282,000, respectively, had not been presented for payment to our bank.


Income Taxes
We account for income taxes utilizing Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”).  ASC 740 requires the asset and liability method for the recording of deferred income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured at current enacted tax rates. When appropriate, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets.


ASC 740 also requires the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more-likely-than-not of being sustained.


Our uncertain tax positions are recorded as “Other non-current liabilities.” We classify interest expense on underpayments of income taxes and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.


Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Additions and improvements are capitalized, including all material, labor and engineering costs to design, install or improve the asset. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table represents a summary of property, plant and equipment at original cost (in thousands):

Atrion Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)
 

Depreciation expense of $6,272,000, $6,769,000 and $6,820,000 was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Depreciation expense is recorded in either cost of goods sold or operating expenses based on the associated assets’ usage.


Patents and Licenses
Costs for patents and licenses acquired are determined at acquisition date. Patents and licenses are amortized over the useful lives of the individual patents and licenses, which are from 7 to 19 years. Patents and licenses are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.


Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired.  Annual impairment testing for goodwill is done using a fair-value-based test.  Goodwill is also reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a change in value may have occurred.  We have identified three reporting units where goodwill was recorded for purposes of testing goodwill impairment annually: (1) Atrion Medical Products, Inc., (2) Halkey-Roberts Corporation and (3) Quest Medical, Inc.  The total carrying amount of goodwill in each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $9,730,000.


Current Accrued Liabilities

Revenues
We recognize revenue when our products are shipped to our customers, provided an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. All risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. Net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns and other allowances. Revenues are recorded exclusive of sales and similar taxes. Returns, discounts and other allowances have been insignificant historically.


Shipping and Handling Policy
Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are reported as revenue and all shipping and handling costs incurred related to products sold are reported as cost of goods sold.


Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs relating to the development of new products and improvements of existing products are expensed as incurred.


Advertising
Advertising production costs are expensed as incurred.  Costs for print placement media are expensed in the period the advertising first appears.  Total advertising expenses were approximately $98,000, $117,000 and $126,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
We have stock-based compensation plans covering certain of our officers, directors and key employees. As explained in detail in Note 8, we account for stock-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, (“ASC 718”).
 
Pension Plan
We terminated our pension plan in 2007 and had settled all obligations under the plan, and no assets, liabilities or stockholders equity accounts remained for the plan, as of December 31, 2009. Prior to final settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009, our pension plan benefits were expensed as applicable employees earned benefits. The recognition of expenses was significantly impacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities and expected return on assets. We used third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with our pension plan benefits. All unrecognized losses, net of tax, were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity.


Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income includes net income plus other comprehensive income, which for us in 2009 consisted of recognition of a loss as a result of pension plan settlement transactions. There were no other comprehensive income items during 2010 and 2011.


New Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance in ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. Entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We have chosen to adopt this standard as of December 31, 2011, and it had no effect on our financial statements.


From time to time, new accounting pronouncements applicable to us are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies, which we will adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
 
Fair Value Measurements
Accounting standards use a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.


As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held certain investments that were required to be measured for disclosure purposes at fair value on a recurring basis.  These investments are considered Level 2 assets. The fair value of our investments is estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of our investments approximated or exceeded the carrying value of the investments (see Note 2).
 
The carrying values of our other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, money market accounts, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued income and other taxes approximated fair value due to their liquid and short-term nature.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable.  


Our cash is held in high credit quality financial institutions. As of December 31, 2011, $4.5 million in cash and cash equivalents was invested in a money market mutual fund and $20.1 million in cash and cash equivalents was deposited at two major financial institutions in the United States. At times, deposits held with financial institutions exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. At December 31, 2011, our uninsured cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $23.0 million.


We have invested a portion of our cash in debt instruments of corporations with strong credit ratings.


For accounts receivable, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral.  We maintain reserves for possible credit losses.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had allowances for doubtful account balances of approximately $42,000 and $36,000, respectively.  The carrying amount of the receivables approximates their fair value. Our largest customer accounted for 12.9%, 14.1% and 15.0% of operating revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  That same customer accounted for 6.7%, 16.2% and 16.1% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  No other customer exceeded 10% of our operating revenues for the years then ended, or accounts receivable as of, December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.



(2)   Investments
 

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held certain investments that were required to be measured for disclosure purposes at fair value on a recurring basis. These investments were considered Level 2 investments. We consider as current assets those investments which will mature in the next 12 months. The remaining investments are considered non-current assets. The amortized cost and fair value of our investments that are being accounted for as held-to-maturity securities, and the related gross unrealized gains and losses, were as follows as of the dates shown below ( in thousands):

 (4)  Line of Credit


We have a revolving credit facility with a money center bank which is secured by substantially all our inventories, equipment and accounts receivable. Effective October 1, 2011, our credit facility was amended to increase the maximum principal amount of our revolving line of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million. Interest under the credit facility is assessed at 30-day, 60-day or 90-day LIBOR, as selected by us, plus one percent (1.30 percent at December 31, 2011) and is payable monthly. We had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at December 31, 2011 or 2010.  The credit facility amendment also extended the termination date for advances under the revolving line of credit to October 1, 2016.  At any time during the term, we may convert any or all outstanding amounts under the credit facility to a term loan with a maturity of two years. Our ability to borrow funds under the credit facility from time to time is contingent on meeting certain covenants in the loan agreement, the most restrictive of which is the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization.  At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of those covenants.

As of December 31, 2011 all of the unrecognized tax benefits, which were comprised of uncertain tax positions, would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits that are affected by statutes of limitation that expire within the next 12 months are immaterial.


We are subject to United States federal income tax as well as to income tax of multiple state jurisdictions.  We have concluded all United States federal income tax matters for years through 2005.  In January 2009, the Internal Revenue Service began examining certain of our United States federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007 and 2008. This audit is ongoing and we believe we have adequately reserved for the costs and liabilities that may arise as a result of this examination. All material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2007. 


We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $77,000, $84,000 and $61,000 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 included net interest expense of $23,000.  Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2011 included a net interest benefit of $12,000 and $7,000, respectively.

(6)   Stockholders’ Equity


Our Board of Directors has at various times authorized repurchases of our stock in open-market or negotiated transactions at such times and at such prices as management may from time to time decide. On August 16, 2011, our Board of Directors terminated the stock repurchase program that was adopted in April 2000 and replaced it with a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we can repurchase up to 200,000 shares of our common stock from time to time in open market or privately-negotiated transactions. A total of 58,105 shares remained eligible for repurchase under the April 2000 program when it was terminated. The new stock repurchase program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In 2011 we repurchased 8,000 shares under the new program leaving a balance of 192,000 shares available for repurchase as of December 31, 2011.  In 2010 we repurchased 9,995 shares in the open market.  No repurchases were made in 2009.


We have increased our quarterly cash dividend payments in September of each of the past three years. The quarterly dividend was increased to $.36 per share in September 2009, to $.42 per share in September 2010 and to $.49 in September 2011.  On January 29, 2010 and December 23, 2010 we also made special cash dividend payments to stockholders of $6.00 and $3.00 per share, respectively.


We have a Rights Plan, which is intended to protect the interests of stockholders in the event of a hostile attempt to take over the Company.  The rights, which are not presently exercisable and do not have any voting powers, represent the right of our stockholders to purchase at a substantial discount, upon the occurrence of certain events, shares of our common stock or of an acquiring company involved in a business combination with us.  This plan, which was adopted in August 2006, expires in August 2016.

(8)   Stock Plans
 
At December 31, 2011, we had four stock-based compensation plans which are described more fully below. We account for our plans under ASC 718, and the disclosures that follow are based on applying ASC 718. ASC 718 requires that cash flows from the use of stock-based compensation resulting from tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation cost (excess tax benefits) be classified as financing cash flows. We recorded $79,000, $1,239,000 and $121,000 of such excess tax benefits as financing cash flows in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
Our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1997 Plan”) provides for the grant to key employees of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance shares.  In addition, under the 1997 Plan, outside directors (directors who are not employees of the Company or any subsidiary) each received automatic annual grants of nonqualified stock options to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock until 2005 when that plan was amended to provide that no additional stock options may be granted to outside directors thereunder.  Under the 1997 Plan, 624,425 shares, in the aggregate, of common stock were reserved for grants. The purchase price of shares issued on the exercise of incentive options was required to be at least equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant.  The purchase price for shares issued on the exercise of nonqualified options and restricted and performance shares was fixed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The options granted become exercisable as determined by the Compensation Committee and expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant.
 
Our Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) provides for the grant to key employees, non-employee directors and consultants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and other stock-based awards. Under the 2006 Plan, 200,000 shares, in the aggregate, of common stock have been reserved for awards. The purchase price of shares issued on the exercise of options must be at least equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant.  The purchase price for restricted and performance shares is fixed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The options granted become exercisable and expire as determined by the Compensation Committee except that incentive options expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant.
 
In May 2007, we adopted our Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and 2,500 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance thereunder. This plan, as amended (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), allows our non-employee directors to elect to receive stock units in lieu of all or part of the cash fees they are receiving for their services as directors.  On the first business day of each calendar year, each participating non-employee director is credited with a number of stock units equal to the cash fees such director has elected to forego for such year divided by the closing price of our common stock on the next preceding date on which shares of our stock were traded.  The stock units are converted to shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis at a future date as elected in advance by the director, but no later than the January following the year in which the director ceases to serve on the Board of Directors, and the shares are delivered to the director.
 
In May 2007, we also adopted our Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the “Director Stock Purchase Plan”) pursuant to which our non-employee directors may elect to receive on the first business day of the calendar year fully-vested stock and restricted stock in lieu of some or all of their fees payable to them during such year. The foregone fees are converted into shares of fully-vested stock and restricted stock on the first business day of such calendar year based on the closing price of our common stock on the next preceding date on which shares of our stock were traded. The restricted stock vests in equal amounts on the first day of the next three succeeding calendar quarters, provided the non-employee director is then serving on our Board of Directors. At the time the Director Stock Purchase Plan was adopted, 2,500 shares were reserved for the issuance thereunder. As of December 31, 2011, there remained 1,180 shares reserved for issuance under such plan.

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and a single option award approach. None of our grants includes performance-based or market-based vesting conditions.  The expected life represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The fair value of stock-based payments, funded with options, is valued using the Black-Scholes valuation method with a volatility factor based on our historical stock trading history. We base the risk-free interest rate using the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U. S. Treasury securities with an equivalent term. We base the dividend yield used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on our dividend history.

There were no options granted in 2010 and 2009.  The fair value for the options granted in 2011 was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2011:

The weighted average grant date fair value of the options granted in 2011 was $40.64. There were no options exercised in 2011.  The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2010 and 2009 were $7.5 million and $.6 million, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options outstanding and options currently exercisable at December 31, 2011, were $4.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively.


During each of 2010 and 2011, we made one award of restricted stock under the 2006 Plan.  Under the terms of the 2010 award, the restrictions lapse over a two-year period.  Under the terms of the 2011 award, the restrictions lapse over a five-year period. In both cases, during the vesting period, holders of restricted stock have voting rights and earn dividends, but the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. Unvested shares are generally forfeited on termination of employment unless otherwise provided in the participant’s employment agreement or, in certain instances, if the termination is in connection with a change in control.  Changes in restricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were as follows:

All shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding at December 31, 2011 are expected to vest. The total intrinsic value of unvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2,066,000, $664,000 and $934,000, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $481,000, $362,000 and $285,000, respectively.


During 2011 and 2009, restricted stock units were granted to certain employees under the 2006 Plan.  All of these stock units are convertible to shares of stock on a one-for-one basis when the restrictions lapse, which is generally after a five-year period. Unvested stock units are forfeited on termination of employment. During the vesting period, holders of all restricted stock units earn dividends as additional units. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain non-employee directors elected to receive stock units in lieu of cash fees for their services as members of the Board of Directors.  Changes in stock units for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:

All unvested restricted stock units at December 31, 2011 are expected to vest. No restricted stock units vested during 2011. The total intrinsic value of all outstanding stock units which were not convertible at December 31, 2011, including 254 stock units held for the accounts of non-employee directors, was $4,236,000. The total fair value of directors’ stock units that vested was $8,000, $9,000 and $8,000 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there remained 1,765 shares of common stock reserved for issuance at the end of deferral periods of stock units which may be credited in the future to non-employee directors.


Compensation related to stock options is based on the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and a single option award approach. Compensation related to restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of the grant. These fair values are then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the entire awards, which is generally the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded share-based compensation expense as a “General and Administrative expense” in the amount of $1,047,000, $606,000 and $668,000, respectively, for all of the above mentioned share-based compensation arrangements. The total tax benefit recognized in the income statement from share-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $359,000, $204,000 and $226,000, respectively.

(9)   Revenues From Major Customers

 
         We had one major customer which represented approximately $15.1 million (12.9 percent), $15.3 million (14.1 percent) and $15.1 million (15.0 percent) of our net revenues during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
(10) Industry Segment and Geographic Information


We operate in one reportable industry segment: developing and manufacturing products primarily for medical applications and have no foreign operating subsidiaries.  We have other product lines which include pressure relief valves and inflation systems, which are sold primarily to the aviation and marine industries. Due to the similarities in product technologies and manufacturing processes, these products are managed as part of our medical products segment. Our revenues from sales to customers outside the United States totaled approximately 42 percent, 40 percent and 39 percent of our net revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We have no assets located outside the United States.

(11) Employee Retirement and Benefit Plans
 
In September 2007, we terminated our pension plan that was maintained for all our regular employees except those of Quest Medical, Inc. and employees hired after May 2005.  Prior to termination, our funding policy was to make the annual contributions required by applicable regulations and recommended by our actuary.  We used a December 31 measurement date for the plan. Affected employees accrued pension benefits through December 31, 2007, but did not accrue any additional benefits under the plan after that date. However, participants continued to earn interest credits on their account balances until all our obligations to plan participants were settled in October 2009. A pension termination settlement charge of $989,000 was recorded as a general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 when all remaining plan obligations were settled.  All assets remaining in the plan after the settlement was completed were transferred to our 401(k) plan in December 2009.
 
The components of net periodic pension cost for 2009 were as follows (in thousands):

To determine the above net periodic pension cost, we used actuarial assumptions of 6% for discount rate and 5.25% for expected long-term return on assets.
 
Our expected long-term rate of return assumption was based upon the plan’s actual long-term investment results as well as the long-term outlook for investment returns in the marketplace at the time the assumption was made.
 
Our pension plan assets were invested during 2009 in a money market account so that the settlement of the termination obligations could be completed after regulatory approvals were received. Final settlement of the plan termination occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 when benefit distributions totaling $3.7 million were made to participants.  After all plan obligations were settled, the remaining plan assets of $263,000 were transferred to our 401(k) plan to be used for contributions and plan expenses.
 
We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan for all employees. Each participant may contribute certain amounts of eligible compensation. We make a matching contribution to the plan. Our contributions under this plan were $487,000, $482,000 and $499,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(12) Commitments and Contingencies



From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various claims, charges and litigation. In some cases, the claimants may seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue the estimated costs of settlement or damages when a loss is deemed probable and such costs are estimable, and accrue for legal costs associated with a loss contingency when a loss is probable and such amounts are estimable. Otherwise, these costs are expensed as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss or defense costs is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. As of December 31, 2011 we had accrued $109,000 for legal fees and expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the litigation or arbitration of two such matters.


We had a dispute which was favorably settled in the third quarter of 2007. This settlement was amended in December 2008.  The amended settlement agreement provides that we may receive annual payments from 2009 through 2024. We have not recorded $6.5 million in potential future payments under this settlement as of December 31, 2011 due to the uncertainty of payment.


We have arrangements with three of our executive officers pursuant to which the termination of their employment under certain circumstances would result in lump sum payments to them.  Termination under such circumstances at December 31, 2011 could have resulted in payments aggregating $4.6 million.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE



None.




ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2011. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were effective as of December 31, 2011. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING


Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. A system of internal control may become inadequate over time because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.


Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
 
Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Report and, as part of its audit, has issued the following attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
 
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Atrion Corporation


We have audited Atrion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Atrion Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Atrion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, Atrion Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Atrion Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated March 12, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
