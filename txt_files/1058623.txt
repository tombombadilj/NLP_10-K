Item 1.    Business 
Description of Certain Definitions and Data  In this annual report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K or this Report) the terms Company, Cumulus, we, us, and our
refer to Cumulus Media Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We use the term local marketing
agreement (LMA) in this Report. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during
that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. In addition to entering into LMAs, we from time to time enter into management or consulting agreements that provide us with the ability, as contractually specified,
to assist current owners in the management of radio station assets, subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval. In such arrangements, we generally receive a contractually specified management fee or consulting fee in
exchange for the services provided.  Unless otherwise indicated, as disclosed herein: 
 


 

 
 we obtained total radio industry listener and revenue levels from the Radio Advertising Bureau (the RAB); 
 


 

 
 we derived historical market revenue statistics and market revenue share percentages from data published by Miller Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP
(Miller Kaplan), a public accounting firm that specializes in serving the broadcasting industry and BIA Financial Network, Inc. (BIA), a media and telecommunications advisory services firm; 
 


 

 
 we derived all audience share data and audience rankings, including ranking by population, except where otherwise stated to the contrary, from
surveys of people ages 12 and over (Adults 12+), listening Monday through Sunday, 6 a.m. to 12 midnight, and based on, for an individual market, either the Arbitron Market Report (Arbitrons Market Report), or
the Nielsen Market Report (Nielsens Market Report); and   


 

 
 all dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest million.  Company Overview  We own and operate commercial radio
station clusters throughout the United States. We believe we are the largest pure-play radio broadcaster in the United States based on number of stations owned and operated. At December 31, 2011, we owned or operated approximately 570 radio
stations (including under LMAs) in 120 United States media markets and operated nationwide radio networks serving over 4,500 affiliates. At December 31, 2011, under LMAs, we provided sales and marketing services for seven radio stations in the
United States.  We are a Delaware corporation, organized in 2002, and successor by merger to an Illinois
corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1997.  Strategic Overview 
Our operating strategy is primarily focused on generating internal growth through improving the portfolio of stations we
own and operate, while enhancing our station portfolio and our business as a whole, through the acquisition of individual stations or clusters that satisfy our acquisition criteria. We further seek to use our national platform to develop new media
businesses that we believe are synergistic with radio broadcasting.

Table of Contents
Our Company was formed in 1997 with an initial strategic focus on mid-sized
markets throughout the United States. We historically focused on such markets because it was our belief that these markets, as compared to large markets, have been characterized by a higher ratio of local advertisers to national advertisers and a
larger number of smaller-dollar customers, both of which have historically led to lower volatility in the face of changing macroeconomic conditions. We believed that the attractive operating characteristics of mid-sized markets, together with the
relaxation of radio station ownership limits under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Telecom Act) and FCC rules, created significant opportunities for growth from the formation of groups of radio stations within these markets. We
focused on capitalizing on opportunities to acquire attractive markets at favorable purchase prices, taking advantage of the size and fragmented nature of ownership in those markets and to the greater attention historically given to the larger
markets by radio station acquirers.  Although our historical focus was on mid-sized radio markets in the
United States, we recognized that the large radio markets can provide an attractive combination of scale, stability and opportunity for future growth, particularly for emerging digital advertising initiatives. According to BIA, these markets
typically have per capita and household income, and expected household after-tax effective buying income growth, in excess of the national average, which we believe makes radio broadcasters in these markets attractive to a broad base of radio
advertisers, and allows a radio broadcaster to reduce its dependence on any one economic sector or specific advertiser. We also believe that having a national platform provides appropriate scale and additional opportunities to launch new digital
media businesses and partner with other national media companies when appropriate. In furtherance of this strategy, in 2011, we completed our previously announced acquisition of the remaining 75.0% of the equity interests of Cumulus Media Partners,
LLC (CMP) that we did not already own (the CMP Acquisition) and our previously announced acquisition (the Citadel Acquisition) of Citadel Broadcasting Corporation (Citadel), each as described in more
detail below.  2011 Developments in our Business  CMP Acquisition  In October 2005, we announced the
formation of CMP, a private partnership that we formed with affiliates of Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group L.P. and Thomas H. Lee Partners, in connection with the acquisition of the radio broadcasting business of Susquehanna
Pfaltzgraff Corp. CMP, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CMP Susquehanna Radio Holdings Corp., owned 32 radio stations in nine markets, including San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Kansas City at the
time of the CMP Acquisition. We completed the CMP Acquisition on August 1, 2011, pursuant to which CMP became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
Pursuant to a management agreement, we had operated CMPs business since 2006. In connection with the CMP
Acquisition, we issued 9.9 million shares of our common stock to affiliates of the three private equity firms that had collectively owned the 75.0% of CMP not owned by Cumulus (the CMP Sellers). Also in connection with the CMP
Acquisition, the 3.7 million outstanding warrants to purchase stock of a subsidiary of CMP were amended and restated to become exercisable for up to 8.3 million shares of our common stock. For additional information regarding the CMP
Acquisition, see Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions. 
Citadel Acquisition and Related Financing Transactions 
We completed the Citadel Acquisition on September 16, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$2.3 billion, consisting of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, the issuance of 23.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A common stock), including 0.9 million
restricted shares, warrants to purchase 47.6 million shares of Class A common stock, 2.4 million warrants held in reserve for potential future issuance related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims
arising from Citadels emergence from bankruptcy, and the consideration to repay the outstanding debt of Citadel. As a result of the Citadel Acquisition, Citadel became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cumulus. At the time of the Citadel
Acquisition, Citadel owned and operated 225 radio stations located in over 50 markets across the United States and a radio network, which produced and distributed a variety of radio programming and formats syndicated across approximately 4,000
station affiliates and 9,000 program affiliations.  Also on September 16, 2011 and in connection with the
Citadel Acquisition, we issued and sold 51.8 million shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock to an affiliate of Crestview Partners II, L.P. (Crestview),
125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to an affiliate of Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (Macquarie), and 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 24.1 million shares of
Class A common stock to UBS Securities LLC (UBS) and certain other entities.  In connection
with the closing of the Citadel Acquisition and the completion of our previously announced related global refinancing (the Global Refinancing), on September 16, 2011, we repaid approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding senior
or subordinated indebtedness and other obligations of (a) Cumulus, (b) certain of our other wholly-owned subsidiaries, and (c) Citadel. This Global Refinancing, and the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel
Acquisition, were funded with (i) $1.325 billion in

borrowings under a new first lien term loan, $200.0 million in borrowings under a new first lien revolving credit facility and $790.0 million in borrowings under a new second lien term
loan, all as described in more detail in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, and (ii) proceeds from the sale of $475.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors (the
Equity Investment) in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). The $610.0 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 7.75% Senior
Notes) issued by us in May 2011 remained outstanding (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions).  Also in connection with the Citadel Acquisition and as part of the transactions contemplated by the Global Refinancing, the Company completed an internal restructuring into a holding company structure,
which included transferring the remaining assets and operations held directly or indirectly by us, other than the equity interests of our direct wholly-owned subsidiary Cumulus Media Holdings Inc. (Cumulus Holdings), to Cumulus Holdings
(the Internal Restructuring). In connection with the Internal Restructuring, all obligations under the 7.75% Senior Notes were assigned to and assumed by Cumulus Holdings, which was substituted for us as the issuer and primary obligor
thereunder, and we provided a guarantee of all such obligations of Cumulus Holdings.  Industry Overview 
The primary source of revenues for radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national spot
advertisers and national network advertisers. National spot advertisers assist advertisers in placing their advertisements in a specific market. National network advertisers place advertisements on a national network show and such advertisements
will air in each market where the network has an affiliate. Over the past ten years, radio advertising revenue has represented a relatively stable 7.0% to 10.0% of the overall United States advertising market, and typically follows macroeconomic
growth trends. In 2011, radio advertising revenues reached $17.4 billion.  Generally, radio is considered an
efficient, cost-effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups. Stations are typically classified by their on-air format, such as country, rock, adult contemporary, oldies and news/talk. A stations format and style of
presentation enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic features. By capturing a specific share of a markets radio listening audience with particular concentration in a targeted demographic, a station is
able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience. Advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services, such as Nielsen Media Research, to estimate how many people within particular
geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations.  The number of advertisements that can be
broadcast by a station without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment. Although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given
time period may vary, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year.  A stations local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses. To generate national
advertising sales, a station usually will engage a firm that specializes in soliciting radio-advertising sales on a national level. National sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the
stations market and receive commissions based on the revenue from the advertising they obtain.  Our
stations compete for advertising revenue with other broadcast radio stations in the market (including low power FM (LPFM) radio stations that are required to operate on a noncommercial basis) as well as other media, including newspapers,
broadcast television, cable television, magazines, direct mail, coupons and outdoor advertising. In addition, the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from services that use new media technologies that are being developed or have
already been introduced, such as the Internet and satellite-based digital radio services. Such services reach nationwide and regional audiences with multi-channel, multi-format, digital radio services that have a sound quality equivalent to that of
compact discs. Competition among broadcast radio stations has also been heightened by the introduction of broadcast digital audio broadcasting (which is digital audio broadcasting delivered through earth-based equipment rather than satellites). See
 Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting  New Services.  We cannot predict how
existing, new or any future generated sources of competition will affect our performance and results of operations. The radio broadcasting industry historically has grown over the long term despite the introduction of new technologies for the
delivery of entertainment and information, such as television broadcasting, cable television, audio tapes, compact discs and iPods. We believe population growth and greater availability of radios, particularly car and portable radios when combined
with increased travel and commuting time, have contributed to this growth. There can be no assurance, however, that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting
industry in general or our stations in particular.

Advertising Sales 
Virtually all of our revenue is generated from the sale of local, regional, and national advertising for broadcast on our
radio stations. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 72.6%, 84.5% and 89.5%, respectively, of our net broadcasting revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising. Additional broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of
national advertising. The major categories of our advertisers consist of:   








 Amusement and recreation
  
Banking and mortgage
  
Furniture and home furnishings

 Arts and entertainment
  
Food and beverage services
  
Healthcare services

 Automotive dealers
  
Food and beverage stores
  
Telecommunications
 Each stations local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local
advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency. We employ a tiered commission structure to focus our individual sales staffs on new business development. Consistent with our operating strategy of dedicated sales forces for each of our
stations, we have also increased the number of salespeople per station. We believe that we can outperform the traditional growth rates of our markets by (1) expanding our base of advertisers, (2) training newly hired sales people and
(3) providing a higher level of service to our existing customer base. This requires a larger sales staff than most of the stations employed at the time we acquired them. We support our strategy of building local direct accounts by employing
personnel in each of our markets to produce custom commercials that respond to the needs of our advertisers. In addition, in-house production provides advertisers greater flexibility in changing their commercial messages with minimal lead-time.
 Our national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level, in
exchange for a commission that is based on the gross revenue from the advertising obtained. Regional sales, which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to buyers that advertise in our markets, are generally made by our local sales
staff and market managers. Whereas we seek to grow our local sales through larger and more customer-focused sales staffs, we seek to grow our national and regional sales by offering to key national and regional advertisers groups of stations within
specific markets and regions that make our stations more attractive. Many of these large accounts have previously been reluctant to advertise in these markets because of the logistics involved in buying advertising from individual stations. Certain
of our stations had no national representation before we acquired them.  Each of our stations has a general
target level of on-air inventory available for advertising. This target level of inventory for sale may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time. Our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on-air
inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand. We seek to broaden our advertiser base in each market by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our cluster of stations, thereby
providing potential advertisers with an effective means to reach a targeted demographic group. Our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our radio stations on-air inventory and, in general, we respond to this demand by varying
prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station. Most changes in revenue are explained by some combination of demand-driven pricing changes and changes in inventory utilization rather than by changes in the
available inventory. Advertising rates charged by radio stations, which are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours, are based primarily on:   


 

 
 a stations share of audiences and on the demographic groups targeted by advertisers (as measured by ratings surveys);
  


 

 
 the supply and demand for radio advertising time and for time targeted at particular demographic groups; and 
 


 

 
 certain additional qualitative factors.  A stations listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned into the station, and the time they spend listening. Each stations ratings are used by its
advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by Cumulus to chart audience growth, set advertising rates and adjust programming.  Competition  The radio broadcasting industry is very
competitive. The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it can charge for its advertising, the number of local advertising competitors, and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. These conditions may
fluctuate and are highly susceptible to macroeconomic conditions. Any adverse change in a particular market affecting 
  6 


Table of Contents

advertising expenditures or any adverse change in the relative market share of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our radio
stations located in that market. There can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share. 
Our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective
markets, as well as with other advertising media as discussed below. Additionally, new online music services have begun selling advertising locally, creating additional competition for both listeners and advertisers. Radio stations compete for
listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group. By building a strong brand identity with a targeted listener base consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets, we are able to
attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners. Companies that operate radio stations must be alert to the possibility of another station changing its format to compete directly for listeners and advertisers. Another stations decision to
convert to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area or to launch an aggressive promotional campaign may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue, increased promotion and other expenses and,
consequently, lower our station Adjusted EBITDA (as defined under  Advertising Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA).  Factors that affect a radio stations competitive position include station brand identity and loyalty, management experience, the stations local audience rank in its market, transmitter power
and location, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position in each
market by extensively researching and improving our stations programming, by implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and by managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of
advertising dollars for each station individually. However, we compete with some organizations that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do. 
Under federal laws and FCC rules, a single party can own and operate a number of stations in a local market, subject to
certain limitations described below. We believe that companies that form groups of commonly owned stations or joint arrangements, such as LMAs, in a particular market may, in certain circumstances, have lower operating costs and may be able to offer
advertisers in those markets more attractive rates and services. Although we currently operate multiple stations in each of our markets and intend to pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups in particular markets, our competitors in
certain markets include other parties that own and operate as many or more stations than we do. We may also compete with those other parties or broadcast groups for the purchase of additional stations in those markets or new markets. Some of those
other parties and groups are owned or operated by companies that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do.  A radio stations competitive position can be enhanced by a variety of factors, including changes in the stations format and an upgrade of the stations authorized power. However, the
competitive position of existing radio stations is protected to some extent by certain regulatory barriers to new entrants. The operation of a radio broadcast station requires an FCC license, and the number of radio stations that an entity can
operate in a given market is limited under FCC rules that became effective in 2004. The number of radio stations that a party can own in a particular market is dictated largely by whether the station is in a defined Arbitron Metro (a
designation designed by a private party for use in advertising matters), and, if so, the number of stations included in that Arbitron Metro. In those markets that are not in an Arbitron Metro, the number of stations a party can own in the particular
market is dictated by the number of AM and FM signals that together comprise that FCC-defined radio market. For a discussion of FCC regulation (including recent changes), see  Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting. 
We cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FCC or Congress, nor can we assess in
advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.  Employees 
At December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 6,323 people, 4,261 of whom are employed full time. As a result of
the Citadel Acquisition, we now have employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Overall, we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 
We employ various on-air personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets. On occasion, we enter into
employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one or more of these personalities could result in a short-term loss of audience share, but we do not believe
that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole.

Table of Contents
We generally employ one market manager for each radio market, or regional
radio market, in which we own or operate stations. Historically, a market manager was responsible for all employees of the market and for managing all aspects of the radio operations. As we have reengineered our local sales strategy over the past
year, the position of market manager has been significantly refocused on revenue achievement and many administrative functions are managed centrally by corporate employees. On occasion, we enter into employment agreements with market managers to
protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of a market manager could result in a short-term loss of performance in a market, but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole.  Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 
General  The ownership, operation and sale of radio broadcast stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended (the Communications Act). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Telecom Act) amended the Communications Act and directed the FCC to change certain of its broadcast rules. Among its other regulatory responsibilities,
the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power, and
other technical parameters of stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast
programming; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules.  The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, the Telecom Act, and related FCC rules and policies (collectively, the Communications Laws). This description
does not purport to be comprehensive, and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast
stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a short-term (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For
particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a stations license renewal application, revoke a stations license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties. 
License Grant and Renewal  Radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for additional terms of a maximum of eight years at a time. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC. Petitions to deny license
renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. While we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, there can be no assurance that all
of our licenses will be renewed for a full term.  Service Areas 
The area served by AM stations is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation, and
soil conductivity. To determine the effective service area of an AM station, the stations power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes are required. The area served by an FM station is determined by a
combination of effective radiated power (ERP), antenna height and terrain with stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters. 
Each class of FM radio station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of ERP from an antenna located at a
certain height above average terrain. The most powerful FM radio stations are Class C FM stations, which operate with up to the equivalent of 100 kilowatts (kW) of ERP at an antenna height of 1,968 feet above average terrain.
These stations typically provide service to a large area that covers one or more counties (which may or may not be in the same state). There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which operate with progressively less power
and/or antenna height above average terrain. Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kW ERP at an antenna height of 492 feet above average terrain. Class B stations can serve large metropolitan areas and their
outer suburban areas. There are also Class B1 stations that can operate with up to the equivalent of 25 kW ERP at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM stations operate with up to the equivalent of 6 kW ERP
at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain, and often (but not always) serve smaller cities or suburbs of larger cities.  The following table sets forth, as of March 2, 2012, the market, call letters, FCC license classification, antenna height above average terrain (for FM stations only), power and frequency of all our
owned and/or operated stations, all pending station acquisitions operated under an LMA, and all other announced pending station acquisitions:

*
 Represents stations for which a renewal application has been timely filed with the FCC and is currently pending before the FCC. The Communications
Act expressly provides that a radio station is authorized to continue to operate after the expiration date of its existing license until the FCC acts on a pending renewal application. 
Regulatory Approvals  The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or
transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including
(1) compliance with various rules limiting common ownership or control of media properties, (2) the financial and character qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an
attributable interest in the assignee or transferee), (3) compliance with the Communications Acts foreign ownership restrictions, and (4) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to programming
and filing requirements.  As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed
assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See  Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations. 
In connection the Citadel Acquisition, we agreed to divest certain stations to comply with FCC ownership limits. These
stations were assigned to a trustee under divestiture trusts that comply with FCC rules. The trust agreements stipulate that we must fund any operating shortfalls from the activities of the stations in the trusts, and any excess cash flow generated
by such stations will be distributed to us. For additional information see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions.  As a component of the CMP Acquisition, we acquired CMP KC, LLC (KC LLC), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of CMP. On February 2, 2011, the direct parent company of KC LLC entered
into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) regarding the restructuring of KC LLCs debt with the lenders under KC LLCs credit facilities (the Restructuring). As part of the Restructuring,
KC LLC was renamed AR Broadcasting. The Restructuring was completed in February 2012. As a result of the completion of the Restructuring, we no longer have an ownership interest in AR Broadcasting. However, we have entered into a management
agreement, similar to an LMA, pursuant to which we will provide corporate management and other services to AR Broadcasting and its subsidiaries, on a basis that is renewable annually by the owner. For additional information see Note 2,
Acquisitions and Dispositions.

Ownership Matters 
The Communications Act restricts us from having more than one-fourth of our capital stock owned or voted by
non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations. We are required to take steps to monitor the citizenship of our stockholders periodically through representative samplings of stockholder citizenship or other appropriate
means to establish a reasonable basis for certifying compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions of the Communications Act.  The Communications Laws also generally restrict (1) the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market, (2) the common ownership, operation or
control of radio broadcast stations and television broadcast stations serving the same local market, and (3) the common ownership, operation or control of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market.
 None of these multiple and cross ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio
broadcast stations or precludes consummation of our pending acquisitions. The Communications Laws limits the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets. 
Because of these multiple and cross ownership rules, a purchaser of our voting stock who acquires an
attributable interest in us (as discussed below) may violate the Communications Laws if such purchaser also has an attributable interest in other radio or television stations, or in daily newspapers, depending on the number and location
of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest. If one of our attributable
stockholders violates any of these ownership rules, we may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct our radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 
The FCC generally applies its television/radio/newspaper cross-ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules
by considering the attributable or cognizable interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station, television station or daily newspaper if the
person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that station or newspaper. Whether that interest is attributable and thus subject to the FCCs multiple
ownership rules, is determined by the FCCs attribution rules. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity that holds that interest as the owner of the radio station, television station or daily newspaper in
question, and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the FCCs ownership rules.  With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5% or more of the corporations voting stock (20% or more of such stock in the case of
insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations, television stations
and daily newspapers owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a joint sales agreement (JSA) also may result in an attributable interest. See  Local Marketing Agreements. 
With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is
attributable. The following interests generally are not attributable: (1) debt instruments, non-voting stock, options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests, or membership interests that have not yet been exercised;
(2) limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not materially involved in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and
(b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly insulates the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified in FCC rules; and (3) holders of
less than 5% of an entitys voting stock. Non-voting equity and debt interests which, in the aggregate, constitute more than 33% of a stations enterprise value, which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization, are
considered attributable in certain circumstances.  On June 2, 2003, the FCC adopted new rules and
policies (the New Rules) which modified the ownership rules and policies then in effect (the Existing Rules). Among other changes, the New Rules (1) changed the methodology used to determine the boundaries of radio
markets, (2) required that JSAs involving radio stations (but not television stations) be deemed to be an attributable ownership interest under certain circumstances, (3) authorized the common ownership of radio stations and daily
newspapers under certain specified circumstances, and (4) eliminated the procedural policy of flagging assignment or transfer of control applications that raised potential anticompetitive concerns (namely, those applications that
would permit the buyer to control 50% or more of the radio advertising dollars in the market, or would permit two entities (including the buyer), collectively, to control 70% or more of the radio advertising dollars in the market). Certain private
parties challenged the New Rules in court, and the court issued an order which 
  21 


Table of Contents

prevented the New Rules from going into effect until the court issued a decision on the challenges. On June 24, 2004, the court issued a decision which upheld some of the FCCs New
Rules (for the most part, those that relate to radio) and concluded that other New Rules (for the most part, those that relate to television and newspapers) required further explanation or modification. The court left in place, however, the order
which precluded all of the New Rules from going into effect. On September 3, 2004, the court issued a further order which granted the FCCs request to allow certain New Rules relating to radio to go into effect. The New Rules that became
effective (1) changed the definition of the radio market for those markets that are rated by Arbitron Inc. (Arbitron), (2) modified the Existing Rules methodology for defining a radio market in those markets
that are not rated by Arbitron, and (3) made JSAs an attributable ownership interest under certain circumstances.  On February 4, 2008, the FCC issued a Report and Order on Reconsideration in conjunction with the quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership rules mandated by the Telecom Act and changed
FCC rules to allow common ownership of a radio station or a television station and a daily newspaper in the top 20 Designated Market Areas (DMAs) and to consider waivers to allow cross-ownership of a radio or television station with a
daily newspaper in other DMAs. The FCC retained all other rules related to radio ownership without change. On July 7, 2011, the same court which overturned the New Rules issued a decision vacating the relaxation of the
radio/television-newspaper cross-ownership rule because the FCC had failed to permit public comment on the change as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. At the same time, the court voided a portion of another FCC order which continued to
use the Small Business Administrations definition of eligible entity to identify minorities and women who could be entitled to certain benefits under FCC broadcast ownership rules that would not be available to other parties. The
court concluded that the FCC had not demonstrated a sufficient link between the use of that term and its stated goal of increasing minority and female ownership of broadcast properties. 
On December 22, 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking based on its 2010 quadrennial review of
broadcast ownership rules. The FCC tentatively concluded that (1) the existing limitations on the number of radio stations a party can own in a particular market remain necessary to serve the public interest, (2) it should retain the AM/FM
subcaps which limit the number of radio stations a single party can own in a particular service (AM or FM) in an individual market, (3) it should reinstate a rule adopted in 2008 to relax the radio/television-newspaper cross-ownership rule in
the top 20 DMAs under certain conditions, and (4) it should repeal the radio-television cross ownership rule which restricted a partys ability to own radio and television stations in the same market. In each case, the FCC requested
comment on these tentative conclusions, and, more specifically, whether the change in the competitive landscape over the last fifteen years  including the advent of satellite radio, the Internet, and radios use of digital technology
 warranted different conclusions and changes to its broadcast ownership rules. The FCC also requested comments concerning the impact of its local radio ownership rule on minority and female broadcast ownership. We cannot predict the timing or
outcome of this proceeding or whether any new rules adopted by the FCC will have a material adverse effect on us. 
Programming and Operation  The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. To satisfy that obligation broadcasters are required by FCC rules and policies to present programming that is
responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. FCC rules require that each radio broadcaster place a list in its public inspection file at the end of each quarter which
identifies important community issues and the programs the radio broadcaster used in the prior quarter to address those issues. The FCC adopted rules for television broadcasters in 2008 which require the use of a standard form in providing similar
information and also require that a television stations public inspection file be made available on the internet. That proposal is being challenged in court. On October 27, 2011, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration and Further
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which it concluded that there were some radio-specific concerns that needed to be addressed prior to implementing the online public file requirements for radio stations. We cannot predict at this time
to what extent, if any, the FCCs proposals will be adopted or the impact which adoption of any one or more of those proposals will have on the Company.  Complaints from listeners concerning a stations programming may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensees
renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities (EEO) in the hiring of new personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information
available on employment opportunities on their website (if they have one), and maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensees failure to abide
by the EEO rule but also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees compliance with EEO rules. We have been subject to numerous EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse
effect on our operations. Stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, the
broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radio frequency radiation). We are and have been subject to listener complaints from time to time, and, while none of them has had a material adverse effect our
operations as a whole to date, we cannot predict whether any future complaint might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

On January 24, 2008, the FCC proposed the adoption of certain rules and
other measures that the FCC said were designed to enhance the ability of radio and television stations to provide programming responsive to the needs and interests of their respective communities. The measures proposed include the creation of
community advisory boards, requiring a broadcaster to maintain a main studio in the community of license of each station it owns, and the establishment of processing guidelines in FCC rules to evaluate the nature and quantity of non-entertainment
programming provided by the broadcaster. Those proposals generated considerable public comment and are still pending before the FCC.  Local Marketing Agreements  A number of radio
stations, including certain of our stations, have entered into LMAs. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be
broadcast during that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. LMAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain
independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the station receiving programming from another
station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws.  A station that brokers more than 15% of the weekly programming hours on another station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of
the FCCs ownership rules. As a result, a radio station may not enter into an LMA that allows it to program more than 15% of the weekly programming hours of another station in the same market that it could not own under the FCCs multiple
ownership rules.  Joint Sales Agreements 
From time to time, radio stations enter into JSAs. A typical JSA authorizes one station to sell another stations
advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime. A typical JSA is an agreement that authorizes one party or station to sell another stations advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime in
exchange for a periodic payment to the station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue collected from the sale of airtime). Like LMAs, JSAs are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the Communications Laws,
including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the
licensee of the station whose time is being sold by another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws. 
Under the FCCs New Rules, a radio station that sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time of another radio
station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station. In that situation, a radio station cannot have a JSA with another radio station in the same market if the FCCs ownership rules would otherwise prohibit
that common ownership.  New Services 
Digital technology also may be used by radio stations on their existing frequencies. In October 2002,
the FCC released a Report and Order in which it selected in-band, on channel (IBOC) as the technology that will permit radio stations to introduce digital operations. The FCC now permits operating radio stations to commence
digital operation immediately on an interim basis using the IBOC systems developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation (iBiquity), called HD RadioTM. In March 2004, the FCC (1) approved an FM radio stations use of two separate antennas (as opposed to a
single hybrid antenna) to provide both analog and digital signals if the FM owner secured Special Temporary Authorization (STA) from the FCC and (2) released a Public Notice seeking comment on a proposal by the National Association
of Broadcasters to allow all AM stations with nighttime service to provide digital service at night. In April 2004, the FCC inaugurated a rule making proceeding to establish technical, service, and licensing rules for digital broadcasting. On
May 31, 2007, the FCC released a Second Report and Order which authorized AM stations to use an IBOC system at night, authorized FM radio stations to use separate antennas without the need for an STA, and established certain technical
and service rules for digital service. The FCC also released another rulemaking notice to address other related issues. On January 29, 2010, the FCC released another Order which authorized FM radio stations to increase the power of their
digital signal to 10% of the ERP of the analog signal. That Order became effective in March 2010. The inauguration of digital broadcasts by FM and perhaps AM stations 
  23 


Table of Contents

requires us to make additional expenditures. On December 21, 2004, we entered into an agreement with iBiquity pursuant to which we committed to implement HD RadioTM systems on 240 of our stations by June, 2012. In exchange for
reduced license fees and other consideration, we, along with other broadcasters, purchased perpetual licenses to utilize iBiquitys HD RadioTM technology. On March 5, 2009, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with iBiquity to reduce the number of
planned conversion, extend the build-out schedule, and increase the license fees to be paid for each converted station. At this juncture, we cannot predict how successful our implementation of HD RadioTM technology within our platform will be, or how that implementation
will affect our competitive position.  In January 2000, the FCC released a Report and Order adopting
rules for a new LPFM radio service consisting of two classes of stations, one with a maximum power of 100 watts and the other with a maximum power of 10 watts. On December 11, 2007, the FCC released a Report and Order which made changes
in the rules and provided further protection for LPFM radio stations and, in certain circumstances, required full power stations (like the ones we own) to provide assistance to LPFM stations in the event they are subject to interference or required
to relocate their facilities to accommodate the inauguration of new or modified service by a full power radio station. The FCC has limited ownership and operation of LPFM stations to persons and entities that do not currently have an attributable
interest in any FM station and has required that LPFM stations be operated on a non-commercial educational basis. The FCC has granted numerous construction permits for LPFM stations and many LPFM stations are now operating around the country. To
date, LPFM radio stations have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. On January 5, 2011, the President signed into law the Local Radio Community Act of 2010 which, among other changes, requires the FCC to (1) modify its
rules to authorize LPFM stations to operate on second-adjacent channels to full-power radio stations, and (2) waive second-adjacent channel separation requirements if the proposed operation of an LPFM station would not cause interference to any
authorized full-power station. The new law required the FCC to complete a study within one year of enactment to assess the economic impact that LPFM stations have on full-power radio stations like the stations we own. In compliance with the new law,
the FCC issued a Report on January 5, 2012 in which it found that LPFM stations generally serve areas that are substantially smaller in size and population than those served by full-service commercial radio stations, that LPFM stations
generally have not been operating as long as full-power commercial stations, that LPFM stations have less of an Internet presence than full-power stations, that LPFM stations offer program formats different than full-power stations, and that the
average LPFM station located in an Arbitron market has negligible ratings and a significantly smaller audience than most full-power stations in the same market. 
Despite the FCCs findings, the new law could increase the number of LPFM stations in markets where we have
stations, and that increase could increase interference from LPFM stations to our stations. We cannot predict at this time whether the new law will have a material adverse impact on our operations in the future. Nor can we predict whether LPFM
service could increase competition for listeners and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operations.  In April 2009, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed a number of changes in the FCCs policies for allocating radio stations to particular markets and preferences that would be
accorded to applicants to implement the command of Section 307(b) of the Communications Act that radio services be distributed fairly throughout the country. One set of proposals would limit the ability of companies like ours to relocate a
radio station from a rural community to a community closer to or in an urban area. The FCC did not address that latter issue when it released its First Report and Order on February 3, 2010. Instead, that report and order only concerned
(1) a priority to be given to American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages and their members in any auction or other distribution of radio stations to serve tribal lands and (2) certain technical changes in the processing of
applications for AM radio stations. Those changes have not had a material adverse effect on our operations, and we do not expect any of those changes to have any material adverse impact on us in the future. 
On March 3, 2011, the FCC issued a new order in that same rulemaking proceeding establishing a rebuttable
presumption that would limit the ability of a broadcaster to move a radio station from one community to another. The FCC created a presumption that, when a proposed community is located in an urbanized area or when the broadcaster could cover more
than 50 percent of an urbanized area by filing a minor modification application, the broadcaster intends to serve the entire urbanized area rather than the specified community and, therefore, would not be able to relocate the station to a community
closer to the urban area. To overcome the presumption, a broadcaster would have to present a compelling showing that (1) the proposed community is truly independent of the urbanized area, (2) the proposed community has a
specific need for an outlet for local expression separate from the urbanized area, and (3) the station would be able to serve the communitys need for a local outlet. The compelling showing may be based on an existing three-pronged test
provided for by an FCC decision; however, the factors in that test will be subject to more rigorous scrutiny than they have been in the past. The FCC announced (1) that in no event would it approve any proposal that would create an area that
had no access to radio services or access to only one radio service, and (2) that the FCC would strongly disfavor any community change that would result in the loss of third, fourth or fifth radio service to more than 15 percent of
the population within a stations existing service area or that would deprive any community of substantial size (meaning a community with a population of 7,500 or greater) of its second local service. The FCCs adoption of
these proposals, as well as other proposals in that rulemaking proceeding, could limit our options in relocating or acquiring ratio stations and, to that extent, may have an adverse impact on our operations.

In addition, from time to time Congress and the FCC have considered, and may
in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience
share and advertising revenues for our radio stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions.  Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations 
Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting
periods and possible review under the HSR Act, by the DOJ or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal
antitrust laws. Transactions are subject to the HSR Act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the stations to be acquired is $68.2 million or more. Historically, most of our acquisitions have not met this threshold. Acquisitions
that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC
could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous potential radio station
acquisitions where an operator proposed to acquire additional stations in its existing markets or multiple stations in new markets, and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring
the sale of certain stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the DOJ has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of 35% of local radio advertising revenues, depending
on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other
criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35% share of radio advertising revenues in many of our markets. 
We are aware that the DOJ commenced, and subsequently discontinued, investigations of several of our prior acquisitions.
The DOJ can be expected to continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this manner, and there can be no assurance that one or more of our pending or future acquisitions are not or will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by
the DOJ or the FTC. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC will not prohibit such acquisitions, require that they be restructured, or in appropriate cases, require that we divest stations we already own in a particular
market. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws.  As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered
into in connection with radio station ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, we
will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under an LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated.  Executive Officers of the Company  The following table

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Many statements contained in this Report are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on our current plans,
intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those specifically identified below.  Risks Related
to Our Business  Our results of operations have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected
by the recent downturn in the U.S. economy and in the local economies of the markets in which we operate.  Revenue generated by our radio stations depends primarily upon the sale of advertising. Advertising expenditures, which we believe to be largely a discretionary business expense, declined significantly
during the recent economic recession, and have only recently begun to improve, partially in light of continued economic uncertainty. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate
advertising revenue in specific markets is directly affected by local or regional 
  26 


Table of Contents

economic conditions, many of which have not returned to pre-recessionary levels. Consequently, the recent recession in the national economy and continued uncertainty in the economies of several
individual geographic markets in which we own or operate stations continue to adversely affect our advertising revenue and, therefore, our results of operations. 
In light of the limited and ongoing recovery from the recent recession, certain individual business sectors that may have
historically spent more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce their advertising expenditures or not return them to pre-recessionary levels if that sector fails to recover on pace with the overall economy. If that sectors
spending would otherwise have represented a significant portion of our advertising revenues, any reduction in its expenditures may adversely affect our revenue.  We operate in a very competitive business environment and a decrease in our ratings or market share would adversely affect our revenues. 
The radio broadcasting industry is very competitive. The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it
can charge for its advertising, the number of local advertising competitors, and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. These conditions are subject to change and highly susceptible to macroeconomic conditions. Any
adverse change in a particular market affecting advertising expenditures, or any adverse change in the relative market share of the stations located in a particular market, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our radio stations
located in that market. There can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share.  Audience ratings and market shares fluctuate, and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of stations located in that market. While we already compete
with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets, any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses, and, consequently, could have a lower
Adjusted EBITDA, if:   


 

 
 another radio station in the market was to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional
campaigns;   


 

 
 a new station were to adopt a competitive format; 
 


 

 
 there is a shift in population, demographics, audience tastes or other factors beyond our control; or 
 


 

 
 an existing competitor was to strengthen its operations. 
The Telecom Act allows for the consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in the markets in which we
operate or may operate in the future. Some competing consolidated owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do. In addition, increased consolidation in our target markets may result in greater competition
for acquisition candidates and a corresponding increase in purchase prices we pay for these acquisitions, which would adversely impact our ability to complete or profit from acquisitions. 
The loss of affiliation agreements by our radio networks could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.  Our radio networks have approximately 4,500 station affiliates and 9,000 program
affiliations. They receive advertising inventory from their affiliated stations, either in the form of stand-alone advertising time within a specified time period or commercials inserted by our radio networks into their programming. In addition,
primarily with respect to satellite radio providers, we receive a fee for providing such programming. The loss of network affiliation agreements by our radio networks could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our
network programming and, therefore, their attractiveness to advertisers. Renewals of such agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations through reduction of advertising revenue. 
We must respond to the rapid changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain
competitive.  The radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry
standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services. In some cases, our ability to compete will be dependent on our acquisition of new technologies and our provision of new services, and there can be no assurance that we will have the
resources to acquire those new technologies or provide 
  27 


Table of Contents

those new services; in other cases, the introduction of new technologies and services, including online music services, could increase competition and have an adverse effect on our revenue.
Recent new media technologies and services include the following:   


 

 
 audio programming by cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, Internet content providers (both landline and wireless),
Internet-based audio radio services, smart phone and other mobile applications, satellite delivered digital audio radio service and other digital audio broadcast formats; 
 


 

 
 HD
RadioTM digital radio, which could provide multi-channel,
multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services; and   


 

 
 LPFM radio, which could result in additional FM radio broadcast stations in markets where we have stations. 
In the future, there may be additional technologies or services developed that compete with radio broadcasting, and that
could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. We also cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to have the resources to acquire any necessary new technologies or to introduce new services that could
compete with any new technologies. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our business. 
We have written off, and could in the future be required to write off, a significant portion of the fair market value of our FCC
broadcast licenses and goodwill, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2011, our FCC licenses and goodwill comprised 73.0% of our assets. Each year, and on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic
350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), to assess the fair market value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill to determine whether the carrying value of those assets is impaired. During the year ended December 31,
2011 we did not have any impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 we recorded impairment charges of approximately $0.7 million, and $175.0 million, respectively, in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast
licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values. Our future impairment reviews could result in additional impairment charges. Such additional impairment charges would reduce our reported earnings for the periods in which they are
recorded.  There are risks associated with our acquisition strategy. 
We intend to continue to grow by acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations in the future. We cannot
predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions would be. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates. Consummation of
any acquisitions would be subject to various conditions, such as compliance with FCC and antitrust regulatory requirements. The FCC requirements include:   


 

 
 approval of license assignments and transfers;   


 

 
 limits on the number of stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market; and 
 


 

 
 other rules or policies, such as the ownership attribution rules, that could limit our ability to acquire stations in certain markets where one or
more of our stockholders, officers or directors has other media interests.  The antitrust
regulatory requirements currently include:   


 

 
 filings with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act, where applicable; 
 


 

 
 expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; and 
 


 

 
 possible review by the United States DOJ or the FTC of antitrust issues under the HSR Act or otherwise. 
We cannot be certain that any of these conditions will be satisfied, the timing thereof or the potential impact that any
such conditions may have on us. In addition, the FCC has in the past asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process, even where proposed assignments would comply with the
numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the FCCs rules and the Communications Act. 
  28 


Table of Contents
Our acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks
associated with:   


 

 
 identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms; 
 


 

 
 integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations; 
 


 

 
 diverting our managements attention from other business concerns; 
 


 

 
 potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; 
 


 

 
 potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any
proposed acquisitions; and   


 

 
 a diminishing number of properties available for sale in appropriately sized and located markets. 
We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions or manage the resulting business
effectively, or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate. In addition, we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions. Depending upon the nature,
size and timing of potential future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions. We cannot assure you that our debt agreements, as may be in place at any time, will permit us to
consummate an acquisition or access the necessary additional financing because of certain covenant restrictions or that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, that financing would be on terms acceptable to our management.
 We are required to obtain prior Federal approval for each radio station acquisition, which approvals may be subject to
our compliance with certain conditions possibly including asset divestitures, which may be material. 
Acquisitions have been, and may continue to be, a critical component of our overall strategy. The acquisition of a radio
station requires the prior approval of the FCC and may require approvals by other governmental agencies, such as the DOJ or the FTC. To obtain that approval, a proposed acquirer is required to file a transfer of control or assignment application
with the FCC. The Communications Act and FCC rules allow members of the public and other interested parties to file petitions to deny or other objections to the FCC with respect to the grant of any transfer or assignment application. The FCC could
rely on those objections or its own initiative to deny a transfer or assignment application or to require changes in the transaction, including the divestiture of radio stations and other assets that we already own or propose to acquire, as a
condition to having the application granted. The FCC could also change its existing rules and policies to reduce the number of stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets. For these and other reasons, there can be no assurance
that the FCC will approve potential future acquisitions that we deem material to our business.  Disruptions in the
capital and credit markets could restrict our ability to access further financing.  We rely in
significant part on the capital and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds from operations are not sufficient for these purposes. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, such as have
been experienced over the past several years, could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities or access capital. Access to funds under credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our lenders to meet their funding
commitments. Those lenders may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from their borrowers within a short period of time.
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets have also resulted in increased costs associated with bank credit facilities. Continued disruptions could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our results of operations. 
Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation,
reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions, could adversely affect our access to financing. Any such disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit
arrangements or other funding can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future uses of cash, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Table of Contents
We are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened
during periods when economic conditions worsen.  Our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, which risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen, there can be no assurance such procedures will
effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.  Counterparties to derivative transactions we enter into may not be able to perform their obligations under such transactions. 
Although we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into
agreements from time to time with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed, there can be no assurances that such counterparties will be able to perform their obligations under the relevant agreements. If our
counterparties fail to perform their obligations, we may not be able to receive the expected benefits from such derivative transactions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
We are dependent on key personnel. 
Our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel, and our loss of one or more of these
individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee
base. Although we have entered into employment agreements with some of our key management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances, we cannot assure you that all of those
restrictions would be enforced if challenged in court.  We also employ several on-air personalities with large
loyal audiences in their individual markets. On occasion, we enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one or more of these personalities
could result in losses of audience share in that particular market which, in turn, could adversely affect revenues in that particular market.  The broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing Federal regulation.  The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our stations. Licenses are normally
granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, we cannot assure you that the FCC will grant our existing or future renewal applications or that the renewals will
not include conditions out of the ordinary course of our operations. The non-renewal, or renewal with conditions, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us. 
We must also comply with the extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations.
FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations that could be material to our overall financial performance or our financial performance in a
particular market.  The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to
limit interference between two or more radio stations. Despite those limitations, a dispute could arise whether another station is improperly interfering with the operation of one of our stations or another radio licensee could complain to the FCC
that one our stations is improperly interfering with that licensees station. There can be no assurance as to how the FCC might resolve that dispute. These FCC regulations and others may change over time, and we cannot assure that those changes
would not have a material adverse effect on us.  The FCC has been vigorous in its enforcement of its indecency rules
against the broadcast industry, a violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time, and indecent material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC has increased its
enforcement efforts over the last few years with respect to these regulations. The FCC regulatory oversight has been augmented by legislation that substantially increased the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming (up to $325,000 for each
incident), and subjected broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings under certain circumstances in the event that they broadcast indecent or obscene material. However, the FCC has

  30 


Table of Contents

refrained from processing and disposing of thousands of complaints that have been filed because of uncertainty concerning the validity of prior FCC rulings, which are now being challenged in
various courts. It is impossible to predict when courts will finally resolve outstanding issues and what, if any, impact those judicial decisions will have on any complaints that have been or may be filed against our stations. Whatever the impact of
those judicial decisions, we may in the future become subject to new FCC inquiries or proceedings related to our stations broadcast of allegedly indecent or obscene material. To the extent that such an inquiry or proceeding results in the
imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected. 
Proposed legislation requires radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists. 
We currently pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music Inc., the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers and SESAC, Inc. Congress has been considering legislation which would change the copyright fees and the procedures by which the fees are determined. The legislation has been the subject of considerable debate and
activity by the broadcast industry and other parties affected by the legislation. It cannot be predicted whether any proposed legislation will become law or what impact it would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial position.
 We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.
 We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our
investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be subject to restrictions on
dividends or other payment restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds
from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. 
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness  The level of our outstanding debt may make it more difficult to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments, including the financial covenants in our First Lien Facility (as defined below),
which could cause a default or an event of default under such debt instruments and could result in the loss of our sources of liquidity, acceleration of our indebtedness and, in some instances, the foreclosure on some or all of our assets, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The
instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness contain restrictive covenants. In addition, our First Lien Credit Agreement (the First Lien Facility), dated as of September 16, 2011, among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as
Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (JPMorgan), UBS, Macquarie, Royal Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents, and U.S. Bank National Association and Fifth Third Bank, as
Co-Documentation Agents, subjects us to a financial covenant if any amounts are outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) or any letters of credit are outstanding that have not been collateralized by cash. As of December 31,
2011, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and, as result, were subject to the financial covenant. Our ability to comply with the covenants in the (i) indenture governing the 7.75% Senior Notes (the
Indenture), (ii) First Lien Facility and (iii) Second Lien Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Facility and, together with the First Lien Facility, the 2011 Credit Facilities), dated as of September 16,
2011, among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan, as Administrative Agent, and UBS, Macquarie, Royal Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents will depend upon our future performance and various
other factors, such as business, competitive, technological, legislative and regulatory factors, some of which are beyond our control. As of December 31, 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants required under our debt obligations,
including the financial covenant under our First Lien Facility. We may not be able to maintain compliance with all of our covenants in the future. In that event, we would need to seek an amendment or waiver to the applicable agreement, or a
refinancing of such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able obtain any amendment or waiver of any such facilities and, even if so, it is likely that such relief would only last for a specified period, potentially necessitating
additional amendments, waivers or refinancings in the future.  In the event that we do not maintain compliance
with the covenants under the 2011 Credit Facilities, lenders could declare an event of default, subject to applicable notice and cure provisions, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial position. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, lenders under any of our indebtedness to
which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies may then be entitled to take certain similar actions. In the event any of our lenders or noteholders, accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to
repay such indebtedness. 
  31 


Table of Contents
The lenders under the 2011 Credit Facilities have taken security interests
in substantially all of our consolidated assets, and we have pledged the stock of certain of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under the 2011 Credit Facilities. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may be forced to liquidate
certain assets to repay all or part of such borrowings, and we cannot assure you that sufficient assets will remain after we have paid all of the borrowings under such 2011 Credit Facilities. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders
could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our ability to liquidate assets could also be affected by the regulatory restrictions associated with radio
stations, including FCC licensing, which may make the market for these assets less liquid and increase the chances that these assets will be liquidated at a significant loss. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our
indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from
operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity
problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect
any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The 2011 Credit Facilities restrict our ability to dispose
of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain proceeds in an
amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.  Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may
still be able to incur additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.  We may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities contain, and credit facilities we enter into in the future may contain, restrictions on
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and any additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be material. These restrictions also will
not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2011, we had borrowing availability of $650.0 million remaining under the 2011 Credit Facilities, $150.0 million under our revolver and $500.0
million under our incremental term loan facility.  Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk,
which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.  Borrowings under the First
Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed
remained the same, and our net income would decrease. As a result, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  The terms of the Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. 
The Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating
and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:   


 

 
 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; 
 


 

 
 pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; 
 


 

 
 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;   


 

 
 issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; 
  32 


Table of Contents


 

 
 make loans and investments;   


 

 
 sell assets;   


 

 
 incur liens;   


 

 
 enter into transactions with affiliates;   


 

 
 alter the businesses we conduct;   


 

 
 enter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; and 
 


 

 
 consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
In addition, the restrictive covenants in the 2011 Credit Facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified
financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Under the First Lien Facility, Cumulus Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries were required to maintain compliance with a consolidated total net leverage ratio no higher than 7.75 to 1
as of December 31, 2011 (with stepdowns beginning in the quarter ending June 30, 2012, if amounts remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility). Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events
beyond our control. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Indenture or the 2011 Credit Facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related
debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the 2011 Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under those facilities to
terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the 2011 Credit Facilities, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to
secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. 
As a result of these restrictions, we may be: 
 


 

 
 limited in how we conduct our business;   


 

 
 unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or 
 


 

 
 unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 
These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate our current and planned business, or make certain changes
in our business and to respond to changing circumstances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our financial results, our indebtedness and our credit ratings could
adversely affect the availability and terms of any financing.  Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 
The public market for our Class A Common Stock may be volatile. 
We cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not decline and the market price could
be subject to wide fluctuations in response to such factors as:   


 

 
 conditions and trends in the radio broadcasting industry; 
 


 

 
 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;
  


 

 
 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 
 


 

 
 technological innovations; 
  33 


Table of Contents


 

 
 competitive developments;   


 

 
 adoption of new accounting standards affecting companies in general or affecting companies in the radio broadcasting industry in
particular; and   


 

 
 general market conditions and other factors. 
Further, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the market on which our Class A
common stock is listed, from time to time have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were not necessarily related or proportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. In addition, general economic, political and
market conditions such as recessions, interest rate movements or international currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.  Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have, and will have, the right to appoint members to our board of directors and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us.
 As of December 31, 2011, and after giving effect to the exercise of all of their respective
options exercisable within 60 days of that date, Lewis W. Dickey, Jr., our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director, his brother, John W. Dickey, our Executive Vice President, and their father, Lewis W. Dickey, Sr., together with
members of their family (collectively, the Dickeys), collectively beneficially owned shares representing approximately 16.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. 
Also as of December 31, 2011, Crestview was our largest shareholder and, according to a Schedule 13D/A filed on
November 22, 2011, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 43.8% of our common stock.  In
addition, in connection with the Equity Investment, on September 16, 2011, the Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) with BA Capital Company, L.P. and Banc of America Capital Investors
SBIC, L.P. (together, the BofA Stockholders), Blackstone, the Dickeys, Crestview, Macquarie and UBS. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the size of the Companys Board was increased to seven members, and the two vacancies on the
Board created thereby were filled by individuals designated by Crestview. In accordance with the Stockholders Agreement, Crestview maintains the right to designate two individuals for nomination to the Board, and each of the Dickeys, the BofA
Stockholders and Blackstone maintains the right to designate one individual for nomination to the Board. The Stockholders Agreement provides that the other two positions on the Board will be filled by the Companys remaining two directors, both
of whom are independent, or their successors, who shall meet applicable independence criteria. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that, for so long as Crestview is the Companys largest stockholder, it will have the right to have one of
its designees, who shall meet the definition of an independent director and who is elected to the Board, and is selected by it, appointed as the lead director of the Board. Further, the parties to the Stockholders Agreement (other than
the Company) have agreed to support such directors (or others as may be designated by the relevant stockholders) as nominees to be presented to the Companys stockholders for approval at subsequent stockholder meetings for the term set out in
the Stockholders Agreement. Each stockholder partys respective director nomination rights will generally survive for so long as it continues to own a specified percentage of the Companys stock, subject to certain exceptions. 
As a result of these significant stockholdings, and their right to designate members of our board, these stockholders are
expected to be able to continue to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our best interests.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
Not applicable. 
Item 2. Properties 
  35 


Table of Contents
The types of properties required to support each of our radio stations
include offices, studios, transmitter sites and antenna sites. A stations studios are generally housed with its offices in business districts of the stations community of license or largest nearby community. The transmitter sites and
antenna sites are generally located so as to provide maximum market coverage.  At December 31, 2011, we
owned studio facilities in 59 of our 115 markets and we owned transmitter and antenna sites in 112 of our 115 markets. We lease additional studio and office facilities in 78 markets and additional transmitter and antenna sites in 48 markets and
lease office space in New York, New York and Dallas, Texas for the production and distribution of our radio network. In addition, we lease corporate office space in Atlanta, Georgia. We do not anticipate any difficulties in renewing any facility
leases or in leasing alternative or additional space, if required. We own or lease substantially all of our other equipment, consisting principally of transmitting antennae, transmitters, studio equipment and general office equipment. 
No single property is material to our operations. We believe that our properties are generally in good condition and
suitable for our operations; however, we continually look for opportunities to upgrade our studios, office space and transmission facilities. 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
In August 2005, we and certain other radio broadcasting companies were subpoenaed by the Office of the Attorney
General of the State of New York in connection with the New York Attorney Generals investigation of promotional practices related to record companies dealings with radio stations broadcasting in New York. We are cooperating with the
Attorney General in this investigation. It is not possible to reasonably estimate what our loss exposure, if any, could be related to this investigation, but we do not currently anticipate that any exposure would materially adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  On December 11, 2008, Qantum filed a
counterclaim in a foreclosure action we initiated in the Okaloosa County, Florida Circuit Court. Our action was designed to collect a debt owed to the Company by Star, which then owned radio station WTKE-FM in Holt, Florida. In its counterclaim,
Qantum alleged that the Company tortiously interfered with Qantums contract to acquire radio station WTKE from Star by entering into an agreement to buy WTKE after Star had represented to the Company that its contract with Qantum had been
terminated (and that Star was therefore free to enter into the new agreement with the Company). On February 27, 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with Star. In connection with this settlement we paid $7.8 million in costs in
2011.  On January 21, 2010, a former employee of CMP Susquehanna Corp. (CMPSC) (which became
a subsidiary of Cumulus upon completion of the CMP Acquisition on August 1, 2011) filed a purported class action lawsuit, pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division (the
Court), against CMPSC claiming (i) unlawful failure to pay required overtime wages; (ii) late pay and waiting time penalties; (iii) failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements; (iv) failure to indemnify for
necessary expenses and losses; and (v) unfair trade practices under Californias Unfair Competition Act.  On September 2, 2011, CMPSC and this former employee entered into a Joint Stipulation re: Settlement and Release of Class Action Claims (the Settlement) with respect to such lawsuit. The
Settlement was preliminarily approved by the Court on February 6, 2012 and provides for the payment by CMPSC of a maximum of $0.9 million in full and final settlement of all of the claims made in the lawsuit. 
In March 2011, we and certain of our subsidiaries were named as defendants along with other radio companies,
including Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., CBS Radio, Inc., Entercom Communications, Greater Media, Inc. and Townsquare Media, LLC in a patent infringement suit. The case, Mission Abstract Data L.L.C., d/b/a Digimedia v. Beasley Broadcast Group,
Inc., et. al., Civil Action Case No: 1:99-mc-09999, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (filed March 1, 2011), alleges that the defendants are infringing or have infringed plaintiffs patents entitled Selection and
Retrieval of Music from a Digital Database. Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit and are not yet able to determine what effect the lawsuit will have, if any, on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  We are currently, and expect that from time to time in the
future will be, party to, or a defendant in, various claims or lawsuits that are generally incidental to its business. We expect that we will vigorously contest any such claims or lawsuits and believe that the ultimate resolution of any known claim
or lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Holders  As of March 2, 2012, there were approximately 1,261 holders of record of our Class A common stock, 16 holders of record of our Class B common stock and one holder of record of our
Class C common stock. The number of holders of our Class A common stock does not include an estimate of the number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms or clearing agencies. 
Dividends  We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend
to retain future earnings for use in our business. We are currently subject to restrictions under the terms of the 2011 Credit Facilities that limit the amount of dividends that we may pay on our common stock. For a more detailed discussion of the
restrictions in our 2011 Credit Facilities, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 2011 Refinancing TransactionsFirst and Second Lien Credit Facilities. 
Dividends on the Series A preferred stock accrue at a rate of 10.0% per annum for the first six months from
issuance, and 14.0% per annum for the period commencing on March 16, 2012 and ending on September 15, 2013, with additional increases for every two-year period thereafter. The dividends are payable in cash, except that, at the option
of the Company, up to 50.0% of the dividends for any period may be paid through the issuance of additional shares of Series A preferred stock. Payment of dividends on the Series A preferred stock is in preference and prior to any dividends payable
on any class of the Companys common stock and, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to the liquidation value thereof prior to, and in preference of, payment
of any amounts to holders of any class of the Companys common stock.  After payment of dividends to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Companys common stock share ratably in any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors of the Company. 
The Company accrued $3.6 million in dividends, paid $0.5 million in cash dividends and accreted $2.7 million on the
Series A Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company paid approximately $3.1 million in cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2012, in accordance with the terms described above.

Primarily as a result of our completion of a number of significant
transactions, including acquisitions and dispositions in any period, we believe that our results of operations for the any period, and our financial condition at any date provide only limited comparability to other periods. You are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on any such comparison.  The selected historical consolidated financial information
presented below does not contain all of the information you should consider when evaluating Cumulus, and should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, beginning on page F-1 of this Report. Various factors are expected to have an effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future, including the ongoing integration of
acquired businesses. You should also read this selected historical consolidated financial information in conjunction with the information under Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Report.

 Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income before depreciation and amortization, LMA fees, acquisition costs, non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
gain or loss on the exchange of assets or stations, realized gain or loss on derivative instruments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, interest expense, net loss on the early extinguishment of debt, other income or expense, gain on
equity investment in CMP, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for a quantitative and qualitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  The following Managements Discussion and Analysis is intended to
provide the reader with an overall understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Operating results attributable
to CMP and Citadel as of August 1 and September 16, 2011, respectively, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2011. This section also includes general information about our
business and a discussion of our managements analysis of certain trends, risks and opportunities in our industry. We also provide a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates as well as a description of
certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results. You should read the following information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated
financial statements beginning on page F-1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the information set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Business  We own and operate commercial radio station
clusters throughout the United States. We believe we are the largest pure-play radio broadcaster in the United States based on number of stations owned and operated. At December 31, 2011, we owned or operated approximately 570 radio stations
(including under LMAs) in 120 United States media markets and operated nationwide radio networks serving over 4,500 affiliates. At December 31, 2011, under LMAs, we provided sales and marketing services for seven radio stations in the United
States.  We are a Delaware corporation, organized in 2002, and successor by merger to an Illinois corporation
with the same name that had been organized in 1997.  2011 Operating Overview and Highlights 
We believe that by completing the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition we have created a leading radio
broadcasting company with a true national platform and with an opportunity to further leverage and expand upon our strengths, market presence and programming. Specifically, with the completion of these acquisitions, we now have an extensive radio
station portfolio consisting of approximately 570 radio stations, including a presence in eight of the top 10 markets, and broad diversity in format, listener base, geography, advertiser base and revenue stream, all of which are designed to reduce
dependence on any single demographic, region or industry. We believe our increased scale will allow larger, more significant investments in the local digital media marketplace and allow our local digital platforms and strategies, including our
social commerce initiatives, to be applied across significant additional markets. Furthermore, the acquisition of Citadels nationwide radio networks, consisting of approximately 4,500 station affiliates and 9,000 program affiliates, which
reach approximately 107 million listeners weekly, are intended to create a national network platform for the syndication of our fully-distributed content and technology assets. 
Cumulus believes that the capital structure resulting from the completion of the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel
Acquisition, and our related financing transactions, will provide increased liquidity and scale for Cumulus to pursue and finance strategic acquisitions in the future. We also believe that we have substantially completed our integration that will
enable us to realize synergies of $51.9 million on an annualized basis resulting from the integration of Citadels historical operations, which when combined with the expected incremental revenues therefrom and the other expected benefits from
the foregoing transactions, should strongly position Cumulus for future growth in what we believe is still a highly fragmented industry.  As we entered 2011, we forecasted that advertising revenues in our markets would experience only modest growth in certain categories, offset by the absence of robust political spending throughout 2011.
Our principal focus for potential revenue growth in 2011 was primarily on local advertising expected to be fueled largely by the continued recovery of the automotive advertising sector. Looking back on our results for 2011, we believe our actual
experience and results were generally consistent with that forecast.  Certain key operating and financial
highlights in 2011, both of which are discussed in more detail below, are as follows:   


 

 
 throughout 2011, we experienced a generally stable operating environment, overcoming the short-term negative macroeconomic impacts of the March 2011
Japanese tsunami and related events that temporarily disrupted the automobile industry, our largest advertising category and the financial market disruptions associated with the U.S. debt ceiling debates. As a result, our operating income decreased;

 in connection with the completion of the Citadel Acquisition, we completed our previously announced Global Refinancing.
 Acquisition of CMP 
We completed the CMP Acquisition on August 1, 2011. As a result of the CMP Acquisition, CMP became an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. CMPs operating results have been included in Cumulus accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of the completion of the CMP Acquisition. Pursuant to a management agreement, we
had operated CMPs business since 2006. In connection with the CMP Acquisition, we issued 9.9 million shares of our common stock to the CMP Sellers. Also in connection with the CMP Acquisition, the 3.7 million outstanding warrants to
purchase stock of a subsidiary of CMP were amended and restated to become exercisable for up to 8.3 million shares of our common stock. For additional information regarding the CMP Acquisition, see Note 1, Description of Business, Basis
of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions. 
Acquisition of Citadel and Related Financing Transactions 
We completed the Citadel Acquisition on September 16, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.3
billion, consisting of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, the issuance of 23.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, including 0.9 million restricted shares, warrants to purchase 47.6 million shares of Class A common
stock, 2.4 million warrants held in reserve for potential future issuance related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims arising from Citadels emergence from bankruptcy, and the consideration to repay the
outstanding debt of Citadel. As a result of the Citadel Acquisition, Citadel became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cumulus. Citadels operating results have been included in Cumulus accompanying audited consolidated financial
statements since the date of the completion of the Citadel Acquisition (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions).  Also on September 16, 2011 and in connection with the Citadel Acquisition, we issued and sold 51.8 million shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of
Class A common stock to an affiliate of Crestview, 125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to an affiliate of Macquarie, and 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase
24.1 million shares of Class A common stock to UBS and certain other entities.  In connection with
the closing of the Citadel Acquisition and the completion of our previously announced Global Refinancing, on September 16, 2011, we repaid approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding senior or subordinated indebtedness and other obligations of
(a) the Company, (b) certain of our other wholly-owned subsidiaries, and (c) Citadel. This Global Refinancing, and the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel Acquisition, were funded with (i) $1.325 billion in
borrowings under a new first lien term loan, $200.0 million in borrowings under a new first lien revolving credit facility and $790.0 million in borrowings under a new second lien term loan, all as described in more detail in Note 8, Long-Term
Debt, and (ii) proceeds from the sale of $475.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities
Act. The $610.0 million of 7.75% Senior Notes issued by us in May 2011 remain outstanding (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions).  Also in connection with the Citadel Acquisition and as part of the transactions contemplated by the Global Refinancing, the Company completed an internal restructuring into a holding company structure,
which included transferring the remaining assets and operations held directly or indirectly by us, other than the equity interests of our direct wholly-owned subsidiary Cumulus Holdings, to Cumulus Holdings. In connection with the Internal
Restructuring, all obligations under the Indenture were assigned to and assumed by Cumulus Holdings, which was substituted for us as the issuer and primary obligor thereunder, and we provided a guarantee of all such obligations of Cumulus Holdings.

Liquidity Considerations 
Historically, our principal needs for funds have been for acquisitions of radio stations, expenses associated with our
station and corporate operations, capital expenditures, and interest and debt service payments. We believe that our funding needs in the future will be for substantially similar matters including, but not limited to, expected capital expenditures
associated with implementing HD Radio technology, as well as expenses relating to the ongoing integration of Citadel and CMP into our Company and additional expenses incurred in connection with those operations, including the operations of our
acquired radio network.  Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flow from operations and
borrowings under credit facilities in existence from time to time. Our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, or audience tastes, and fluctuations in preferred advertising
media. In addition, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, which risks may be exacerbated in challenging economic periods. In recent periods, management has taken steps to mitigate this
risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancements to our credit approval process, although no assurances as to the longer-term success of these efforts can be provided. In addition, we believe the acquisition of the broad diversity in
format, listener base, geography, advertiser base and revenue stream that accompanied the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition should help us reduce dependence on any single demographic, region or industry. 
On September 16, 2011 in connection with the closing of the Citadel Acquisition and in order to complete the Global
Refinancing, the Company entered into the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility. The First Lien Facility consists of a $1.325 billion first lien term loan facility, net of an original issue discount of $13.5 million, maturing in September
2018 (the First Lien Term Loan) and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), and matures in September 2016. The Second Lien Facility consists of a $790.0 million second lien term loan net of
an original discount of $12.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan), and matures in September 2019. On that date and also in connection therewith, the Company used borrowings of $1.325 billion under the First Lien Term Loan, $200.0 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility and $790.0 million under the Second Lien Term Loan, along with proceeds from the Equity Investment, to (i) fund the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel Acquisition; (ii) repay in full
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our then-existing credit agreement (the Terminated Credit Agreement); (iii) repay all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of CMPSC; (iv) redeem
CMPSCs outstanding 9.875% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and variable rate senior secured notes due 2014; (v) redeem in accordance with their terms all outstanding shares of preferred stock of CMP Susquehanna Radio Holdings Corp.
(Radio Holdings); and (vi) repay all amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and the premiums thereon, under Citadels pre-existing credit agreement and to redeem Citadels senior notes due 2018. The $610.0
million of 7.75% Senior Notes issued by the Company in May 2011 remain outstanding, with Cumulus Holdings substituted as the issuer thereunder pursuant to the Internal Restructuring. 
Pursuant to the Equity Investment, on September 16, 2011, the Company issued and sold (i) 51.8 million
shares of Class A common stock to Crestview; (ii) 125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to Macquarie; and (iii) 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase
24.1 million shares of its Class A common stock to UBS and certain other investors. Also pursuant thereto, the Company issued the Crestview warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock, at an exercise price of
$4.34 per share. Dividends on the Series A preferred stock accrue at a rate of 10.0% per annum for the first six months from issuance, and 14.0% per annum for the period commencing on March 16, 2012 and ending on September 15,
2013, with additional increases for every two-year period thereafter. The dividends are payable in cash, except that, at the option of the Company, up to 50.0% of the dividends for any period may be paid through the issuance of additional shares of
Series A preferred stock. Payment of dividends on the Series A preferred stock is in preference and prior to any dividends payable on any class of the Companys common stock and, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to the liquidation value thereof prior to, and in preference of, payment of any amounts to holders of any class of the Companys common stock. 
We have assessed the current and expected implications of our business climate, our current and expected needs for funds
and our current and expected sources of funds and determined, based on our financial condition as of December 31, 2011, that cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from operating activities and borrowing availability under the Revolving
Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and debt service payments, and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations through December 31, 2012.

Advertising Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA 
Our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations. Our sales of advertising time are
primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local, regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations. Advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a stations ability to attract
audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers, as measured principally by various ratings agencies on a periodic basis. We endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty and we believe that the diversification of formats on our
stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format. In addition, we believe that the radio station portfolio that we own and operate as a result of the CMP
Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, which has increased diversity in terms of format, listener base, geography, advertiser base and revenue stream, will further reduce our revenue dependence on any single demographic, region or industry.
 Our radio stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on-air inventory of advertising time and
adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand. The optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the programming format of a particular station. Each of our stations has a general target level of on-air inventory available
for advertising. This target level of inventory for sale may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time. We seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic
segments across our cluster of stations, thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group. In the broadcasting industry, radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements
that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging, instead of for cash. Trade revenue totaled $21.2 million, $16.7 million and $16.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our
advertising contracts are generally short-term. We generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising, which is sold primarily by a stations sales staff. Local and regional advertising represented approximately 72.6%, 84.5% and
89.5% of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Our
recently acquired radio networks generate substantially all of their revenue from the sale of advertising time accumulated from their affiliate stations. Typically, in exchange for the right to broadcast radio network programming, its affiliates
remit a portion of their advertising time, which is then aggregated into packages focused on specific demographic groups and sold by our radio networks to our advertiser clients that want to reach the listeners who comprise those demographic groups
on a national basis. Our radio networks generate advertising revenue by embedding a defined number of advertising units in their syndicated programs, which they sell to advertisers at premium prices. 
Our advertising revenues vary by quarter throughout the year. As is typical in the radio broadcasting industry, our first
calendar quarter produces the lowest revenues during the last twelve month period, as advertising generally declines following the winter holidays. The second and fourth calendar quarters typically produce the highest revenues for the year. Our
operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods, if at all. We continually evaluate opportunities to increase
revenues through new platforms, including technology-based initiatives.  Adjusted EBITDA is the financial
metric utilized by management to analyze the cash flow generated by the Companys business. This measure isolates the amount of income generated by its radio stations after the incurrence of corporate general and administrative expenses.
Management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of the Companys radio station portfolio, including the corporate resources employed to manage the portfolio, to the funding of its other operating expenses and to the funding of
debt service and acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our First Lien Facility. 
In deriving this measure, management excludes depreciation, amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense
from the measure, as these do not represent cash payments for activities related to the operation of the radio stations. In addition, we also exclude LMA fees from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, even though such fees require a cash settlement,
because they are excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA contained in our First Lien Facility. Management excludes any gain or loss on the exchange of radio stations as it does not represent a cash transaction. Management also excludes any
realized gain or loss on derivative instruments as it does not represent a cash transaction nor is it associated with radio station operations. Management excludes impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as it does not require a cash outlay.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, nevertheless is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a radio company. Management
has also observed that Adjusted EBITDA is routinely employed to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for radio broadcasting companies, and is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining compliance with certain covenants
in our First Lien Facility. Given the relevance to the overall value of the Company, management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Companys operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
A quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
and presented in accordance with GAAP, follows in this section.  Results of Operations 
Primarily as a result of the completion of the significant transactions described above in 2011, Cumulus believes that
its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, and its financial condition at such date, will provide only limited comparability to prior periods. Investors are cautioned to not place undue reliance on any such comparison.
Revenues of $288.3 million attributable to the acquisitions of CMP and Citadel in 2011 are included in the Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Our managements discussion and analysis of results of operations for
the three years ended December 31, 2011, has been presented on a historical basis.  Year Ended December 31, 2011 compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2010  Net Revenues. Excluding the impact of net revenues as a result
of the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $2.1 million, or 0.8%, to $261.2 million compared to $263.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This
decrease was primarily attributable to reduced political advertising following the 2010 mid-term elections and a decrease in management fee income (which had been earned by us for services provided to CMP prior to the date of the CMP Acquisition),
partially offset by an increase in core advertising categories, particularly automotive and retail categories. 
Direct Operating Expenses, Excluding Depreciation, Amortization and LMA Fees. Excluding the impact of
direct operating expenses as a result of the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $7.9 million, or 4.9%, to $151.9 million compared to $159.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a reduction in fixed sales expenses and other operating costs.   Depreciation and Amortization. Excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization as a result of the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, depreciation and amortization for the
year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $2.1 million, or 23.1%, to $7.0 million compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully
depreciated.  LMA Fees. Excluding the impact of LMA fees as a result of the CMP
Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, LMA fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $0.2 million, or 9.5%, to $2.3 million compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses, Including Stock-based Compensation Expense. Corporate,
general and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation expense for year ended December 31, 2011, increased $72.3 million to $90.8 million, compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is
primarily comprised of $54.0 million in one-time costs associated with the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, additional personnel costs of $6.1 million as a result of the acquisitions, an increase of $8.3 million in stock-based
compensation expenses and increases in other corporate expense items.  Gain on Exchange of
Assets or Stations. During 2011, we completed an exchange transaction with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. (Clear Channel) to swap our Canton, Ohio station for eight of Clear Channels radio stations in the Ann Arbor and
Battle Creek, Michigan markets. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $15.3 million. We did not complete any similar transactions in 2010. 
Realized Loss on Derivative Instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and
2010, we recorded charges of $3.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to our recording of the fair market value of a put option (the Green Bay Option) that allows Clear Channel to require the Company to repurchase the five
Green Bay radio stations at any time during the two-month period commencing July 1, 2013 (or earlier if the LMA with Clear Channel relating to the Green Bay stations is terminated before this date) for $17.6 million (the fair value of the radio
stations as of April 10, 2009). We entered into the Green Bay Option in conjunction with an asset exchange in the second quarter of 2009.  Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We recorded approximately $0.7 million of charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill for the year ended
December 31, 2010. The impairment loss is related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded in conjunction with our annual impairment testing conducted during the fourth quarter (see Note 4, Intangible Assets and Goodwill
in the notes to the financial statements that accompany in this Report). There were no similar asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2011. 
Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2011
increased $56.7 million to $87.0 million compared to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest expense associated with outstanding debt increased by $57.8 million to $83.8 million as compared to
$26.0 million in the prior year period. Interest expense increased due to a higher average amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the Global Refinancing in the third quarter of 2011. The following summary details the components of
our interest expense, net of interest income (dollars in thousands):

 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31,
2011, we recorded $4.4 million in loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of our debt refinancing in May 2011. There was not a similar extinguishment of debt during 2010. 
Terminated Transaction (Expense) Income. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $7.8
million in costs, which were paid in 2011 and were associated with the settlement of litigation related to our since-terminated attempt to purchase radio station WTKE-FM in Holt, Florida (see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies in the
notes to the financial statements that accompany this report). We had no similar expense for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Gain on Equity Investment in CMP. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an $11.6 million gain on our equity investment in CMP due to the CMP Acquisition. There was not a
similar gain during the year ended December 31, 2010 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions).  Income Tax Benefit (Expense). We recorded an income tax benefit of $61.3 million as compared to a $3.8 million expense during the prior year. The income tax benefit for 2011 is
primarily due to a release of the valuation allowance as a result of the CMP Acquisition and Citadel Acquisition while the 2010 tax expense is primarily due to tax amortization of intangibles. 
Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2011 increased $43.7 million, or 50.0%, to $131.2 million compared to $87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. 
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income
(the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP) as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (dollars in thousands):

 Intangible Assets (including Goodwill), net. Intangible assets, net of
amortization, were $3,350.4 million and $217.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill. Intangible assets, net, increased from the
prior year due to the acquisitions of CMP and Citadel in 2011.  We continue to monitor whether any impairment
triggers are present and we may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods. Our impairment testing requires us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value, including assumptions about the cash flow growth of our
businesses. Additionally the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors, including market multiples at the time the impairments tests are performed. The following factors could adversely impact the current carrying value of our
broadcast licenses and goodwill: (a) sustained decline in the price of our common stock, (b) the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates, (c) a decline in our industry
forecasted operating profit margins, (d) the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations, or (e) the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations. 
Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 
Net Revenues. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $7.3 million, or 2.8%,
to $263.3 million compared to $256.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in national and political revenue which was offset by a decrease of $1.3 million spread over the remainder of
the revenue categories. We believe that advertising revenue in our markets will have modest growth through the first half of 2011 as the local advertising marketplace becomes more robust in conjunction with improved macroeconomic conditions. We
also believe we will see continued growth in national advertising spending, although at lower levels than we experienced in 2010. While we anticipate continued strength in our core advertising categories into the second half of 2011, we will
face a tougher comparison period due to the absence of cyclical political spending. Overall, we are experiencing a much more normalized marketplace than seen in recent years. 
Direct Operating Expenses, Excluding Depreciation, Amortization and LMA Fees. Direct operating expenses for
the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $5.9 million, or 3.5%, to $159.8 million compared to $165.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a $3.2 million decrease in programming expense and a $2.8
million decrease in sales expense. We will continue to monitor all our operating costs and to the extent we are able to identify any additional cost saving measures, we will implement them as needed to remain in compliance with current and future
debt covenant requirements.  Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and
amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $2.0 million, or 18.3%, to $9.1 million compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets
becoming fully depreciated coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures.

Table of Contents
LMA Fees. LMA fees for the year ended December 31, 2010
decreased $0.2 million to $2.1 million compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31 2009. LMA fees in 2010 were comprised primarily of fees associated with stations operated under LMAs in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Battle Creek, Michigan.  Corporate General and Administrative Expenses,
Including Non-cash Stock-based Compensation Expense. Corporate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $2.2 million, or 10.5%, to $18.5 million compared to $20.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009, primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring severance costs of $0.5 million, a decrease of $1.1 million in consulting and professional fees, with the remaining $0.6 million decrease attributable to miscellaneous
expenses.  Gain on Exchange of Assets or Stations. During 2009 we completed an
exchange transaction with Clear Channel to swap five of our radio stations in Green Bay, Wisconsin for two of Clear Channels radio stations located in Cincinnati, Ohio. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately
$7.2 million during 2009. We did not complete any similar transactions in 2010. 
Realized Loss on Derivative Instrument. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009 we recorded charges of $2.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively, related to our recording of the fair market value of the Green Bay Option. We entered into the Green Bay Option in conjunction with an asset exchange in 2009.
 Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We recorded approximately $0.7 million and
$175.0 million of charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The impairment loss is related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded in conjunction
with our annual impairment testing conducted during the fourth quarter (see Note 4, Intangible Assets and Goodwill in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this Report). 
Interest Expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased
$3.7 million, or 10.8%, to $30.3 million compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. While overall interest expense decreased, the interest expense associated with outstanding debt increased by $4.0 million to
$26.0 million as compared to $22.0 million in the prior years period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the borrowing base due to the pay-down of approximately
$43.1 million of debt compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, interest expense increased by $1.4 million related to the yield adjustment on the interest rate swap. These increases were offset by a
$9.1 million decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap/option agreement. The following summary details the components of our interest expense, net of interest income (dollars in thousands):

 Terminated Transaction (Expense) Income. For the year ended
December 31, 2010, we incurred $7.8 million in costs associated with a terminated transaction, which costs are payable in 2011, attributable to the settlement of litigation related to our since-terminated attempt to purchase radio station
WTKE-FM in Holt, Florida (see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this Report). We had no similar expense for the year ended December 31, 2009. 
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. We recorded an income tax expense of $3.8 million in 2010 as compared
with a $22.6 million benefit during the prior year. The income tax expense for 2010 is primarily due to tax amortization of intangible assets, while the 2009 benefit is primarily due to the impairment charge on intangible assets.
 Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2010 increased $14.9 million, or 20.5%, to $87.5 million compared to $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

 Intangible Assets (including Goodwill), net. Intangible assets, net of
amortization, were $217.0 million and $217.5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill. Intangible assets, net, decreased from the
prior year primarily due to a $0.7 million impairment charge taken for the year ended December 31, 2010, in connection with our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2010, which was offset by the purchase of $0.2 million of
intangible assets in 2010.  Seasonality and Cyclicality 
We expect that our operations and revenues will continue to be seasonal in nature, with generally lower revenue generated
in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year. The seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on
these formats with the retail cycle. This seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results. Such variations could have a material effect on the timing of our cash flows. 
In addition, our revenues tend to fluctuate between years, consistent with, among other things, increased advertising
expenditures in even-numbered years by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. This political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity Considerations

December 31, 2010, net cash used in financing activities decreased $18.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $16.0 million decrease in repayments of debt in 2010 as compared to 2009 and a
$2.8 million decrease related to fees paid directly to our lenders.  2011 Acquisitions 
For a detailed discussion of our material 2011 acquisitions, see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions in the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We did not complete any material dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2011.  2010 Acquisitions  We did not complete any material
acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2010.  2011 Refinancing Transactions
 First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities 
At December 31, 2011, there was $1,325.0 billion outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan,
$150.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $790.0 million outstanding under the Second Lien Term Loan. 
  50 


Table of Contents
Borrowings under the First Lien Facility bear interest, at the option of
Cumulus Holdings, based on the Base Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), in each case plus 4.5% on LIBOR-based borrowings and 3.5% on Base Rate-based borrowings. LIBOR-based borrowings are subject to a LIBOR floor of
1.25% for the First Lien Term Loan and 1.0% for the Revolving Credit Facility. Base Rate-based borrowings are subject to a Base Rate Floor of 2.25% for the First Lien Term Loan and 2.0% for the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien Term Loan
amortizes at a per annum rate of 1.0% of the original principal amount of the First Lien Term Loan, payable quarterly, commencing March 31, 2012, with the balance payable on the maturity date. Base Rate is defined, for any day, as the
fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1.0%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan, as established from time to time,
and (iii) 30 day LIBOR plus 1.0%.  Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility bear interest, at the option
of Cumulus Holdings, at either the Base Rate plus 5.0%, subject to a Base Rate floor of 2.5%, or LIBOR plus 6.0%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.5%.  Interest on Base Rate-based borrowings is due on the last day of each calendar quarter, except with respect to swingline loans, for which interest is due on the day that such swingline loan is required to
be repaid. Interest payments on loans whose interest rate is based upon LIBOR are due at maturity if the term is three months or less or every three months and at maturity if the term exceeds three months. 
At December 31, 2011, borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan bore interest at 5.75% per annum, borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 6.75% per annum and borrowings under the Second Lien Term Loan bore interest at 7.50% per annum. Effective December 8, 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with
JPMorgan with an aggregate notional amount of $71.3 million, which agreement caps the interest rate on an equivalent amount of the Companys LIBOR based term loans at a maximum of 3.0% per annum. The interest rate cap agreement matures on
December 8, 2015.  The representations, covenants and events of default in the 2011 Credit Facilities and
financial covenant in the First Lien Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events of default in the 2011 Credit Facilities include, among others, (a) the failure to pay when due the obligations owing under the credit
facilities; (b) the failure to comply with (and not timely remedy, if applicable) certain financial covenants (as required by the First Lien Facility); (c) certain cross defaults and cross accelerations; (d) the occurrence of
bankruptcy or insolvency events; (e) certain judgments against us or any of its restricted subsidiaries; (f) the loss, revocation or suspension of, or any material impairment in the ability to use one or more of, any material FCC licenses;
(g) any representation or warranty made, or report, certificate or financial statement delivered, to the lenders subsequently proven to have been incorrect in any material respect; and (h) the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined
in the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility, as applicable). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the First Lien Facility
and the Second Lien Facility, as applicable, and the ancillary loan documents as a secured party.  As a result
of amounts being outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2011, the First Lien Facility required compliance with a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 7.75 to 1.0 as of such date (and provides for reductions in
such ratio beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2012 if amounts are then-outstanding thereunder). 
The First Lien Facility also contains customary restrictive non-financial covenants, which, among other things, and with
certain exceptions, limit our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; consummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and pay dividends or repurchase stock. 
At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of the required covenants under the First Lien Facility. The
Second Lien Facility does not contain any financial covenants.  Certain mandatory prepayments on the First
Lien Term Loan, Second Lien Term Loan, and the preferred stock are required upon the occurrence of specified events, including upon the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, upon the sale of certain assets and upon the occurrence of certain
condemnation or casualty events, and from excess cash flow.  Our, Cumulus Holdings and our respective
restricted subsidiaries obligations under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are collateralized by a first priority lien and second priority lien, respectively, on substantially all of our, Cumulus Holdings and our
respective restricted subsidiaries assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted, including, without limitation, 
  51 


Table of Contents

intellectual property and substantially all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 66.0% of the capital stock of any future first-tier foreign subsidiaries. In
addition, Cumulus Holdings obligations under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are guaranteed by us and substantially all of our restricted subsidiaries, other than Cumulus Holdings. 
7.75% Senior Notes  On May 13, 2011, we issued $610.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Senior Notes. Proceeds from the sale of the 7.75% Senior Notes were used to, among other things, repay the
$575.8 million outstanding under the term loan facility under the Terminated Credit Agreement.  In
connection with the Internal Restructuring, on September 16, 2011, we and Cumulus Holdings entered into a supplemental indenture with the trustee under the indenture governing the 7.75% Senior Notes, which provided for, among other things, the
(i) assumption by Cumulus Holdings of all of our obligations; (ii) substitution of Cumulus Holdings for us as issuer; (iii) our release from all obligations as original issuer; and (iv) our guarantee of all of Cumulus
Holdings obligations, in each case under the indenture and the 7.75% Senior Notes.  Interest on the
7.75% Senior Notes is payable on each May 1 and November 1, commencing November 1, 2011. The 7.75% Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2019.  Cumulus Holdings, as issuer of the 7.75% Senior Notes, may redeem all or part of the 7.75% Senior Notes at any time on or after May 1, 2015. At any time prior to May 1, 2014, Cumulus Holdings
may also redeem up to 35.0% of the 7.75% Senior Notes using the proceeds from certain equity offerings. At any time prior to May 1, 2015, Cumulus Holdings may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus a make-whole premium. If Cumulus Holdings sells certain assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, it will be required to make an offer to purchase the 7.75% Senior Notes. 
In connection with the substitution of Cumulus Holdings as the issuer of the 7.75% Senior Notes, we have also guaranteed
the 7.75% Senior Notes. In addition, each existing and future domestic restricted subsidiary that guarantees our indebtedness, Cumulus Holdings indebtedness or indebtedness of our subsidiary guarantors (other than our subsidiaries that hold
the licenses for our radio stations) guarantees, and will guarantee, the 7.75% Senior Notes. The 7.75% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Cumulus Holdings and rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured
debt of Cumulus Holdings and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated debt of Cumulus Holdings. The 7.75% Senior Notes guarantees are our and the other guarantors senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment
to all of our and the other guarantors existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of our and the other guarantors future subordinated debt. The 7.75% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated
to any of Cumulus Holdings, our or the guarantors existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 7.75% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all
indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred stock, of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including all of our liabilities and the guarantors foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that hold the licenses for our radio stations.
 During the year ended December 31, 2011, we capitalized $58.9 million in deferred financing costs
and $25.5 million related to debt discount for fees paid directly to lenders.  For the year ended
December 31, 2011, we recorded $2.9 million and $1.5 million of amortization costs related to the credit facilities and 7.75% Senior Notes, respectively.  Terminated Credit Agreement  As described above,
all amounts outstanding under the Terminated Credit Agreement were repaid in full on September 16, 2011, and such facility was terminated. For a detailed discussion of the Terminated Credit Agreement, see Note 8, Long-Term Debt in
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, our management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of our Board, evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, intangible assets, self-insurance
liabilities, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast, subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists and collection is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast.

Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risks 
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on several factors including the length of time receivables are past due, trends and current economic factors. All
balances are reviewed and evaluated on a consolidated basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any
off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.  In the opinion of our management, credit risk
with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of our diversified customers and the geographic diversification of our customer base. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and believe that adequate allowances
for any uncollectible accounts receivable are maintained.  Intangible Assets 
We have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts. These intangible assets are comprised primarily of
broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations. We are required to review the carrying value of certain intangible assets and our goodwill annually for impairment, and more frequently if circumstances warrant, and
record any impairment to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair value. We did not have any impairment during the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended
December 31, 2010, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $0.7 million, to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair values. As of December 31, 2011, we had $3.0 billion in
intangible assets and goodwill, which represented approximately 72.1% of our total assets.  We perform our
annual impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill during the fourth quarter. The impairment tests require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value, including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our
businesses. Additionally, the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors, including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed. More specifically, the following could adversely impact the current carrying
value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill: (a) sustained decline in the price of our common stock, (b) the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates, (c) a decline in our
industry forecasted operating profit margins, (d) the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations, or (e) the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations. The
calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach and discounted cash flow methodology. As part of our overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill, we have determined that our geographic markets
are the appropriate unit of accounting.  The assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the reporting
units are based on currently available data and managements best estimates and, accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values. 
We generally conducted our impairment tests as follows: 
Step 1 Goodwill Test  In performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill, the fair value of each market was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, an income approach. The discounted cash flow approach requires
the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate. We used an approximate five-year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market
participant view. We made certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data and historical performance. We then projected future operating expenses in order to derive operating profits, which we combined with working
capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows.  For our annual impairment test,
we performed the Step 1 goodwill test (the Step 1 test) and compared the fair value of each market to the carrying value of its net assets as of December 31, 2011. This test was used to determine if any of our markets have an
indicator of impairment (i.e. the market net asset carrying value was greater than the calculated fair value of the market).  Our analysis determined that, based on our Step 1 test, the fair value of all our markets containing goodwill balances were above their carrying value. Since no impairment indicator existed in Step 1, we
determined goodwill was appropriately stated as of December 31, 2011. 
  54 


Table of Contents
The discount rate employed in the fair value calculations of our markets was
10.0% for our Step 1 test. We believe this discount rate was appropriate and reasonable for estimating the fair value of the markets.  For periods after 2011, we projected annual revenue growth based on industry data and historical performance. We derived projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical financial
performance and expected growth. Our projections were based on then-current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the markets.  To validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of our assumptions, we conducted an overall check of our fair value calculations by comparing the implied fair value of our markets, in
aggregate, to our market capitalization as of December 31, 2011. As compared with the market capitalization value of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately $4.2 billion was
approximately $477.8 million, or 12.9%, higher than the market capitalization.  Key data points included in
the market capitalization calculations were as follows:   


 

 
 shares outstanding, including certain warrants, of 216.0 million as of December 31, 2011; 
 


 

 
 closing price of our Class A common stock for December 31, 2011 of $3.34 per share; and 
 


 

 
 total debt, including preferred equity, of $2,995.5 million, on December 31, 2011. 
Utilizing the above analysis and data points, we concluded the fair values of our markets, as calculated, are appropriate
and reasonable.  The table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the
carrying value of 73 different reporting units under the Step 1 test as of December 31, 2011. Managements opinion is that the summary form of this table is more meaningful to the reader than presenting each reporting unit separately in
assessing the recoverability of the reporting unit, including goodwill.

 Step 2 Goodwill Test 
We did not perform a Step 2 test since the Step 1 test did not indicate a potential impairment. 
Indefinite Lived Intangibles (FCC Licenses) 
We perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles (our FCC licenses) during the fourth quarter and
on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. We have combined all of our broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes. As
part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite-lived intangibles test, we determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing. 
As a result of the annual impairment test, we determined that no impairment charge existed for the FCC licenses.
 For the annual impairment test of our FCC licenses, including both AM and FM licenses, we utilized the income
approach, specifically the Greenfield Method, with the exception of two stations which were not operating as of the valuation date. A minimum value of $50,000 was estimated for the FCC licenses of these two non-operating stations. In completing the
appraisals, we conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued. 
  55 


Table of Contents
The income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject
property, which is then analyzed and projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value. The Greenfield Method isolates cash flows attributable to the subject asset using a hypothetical
start-up approach.  The estimated fair values of our FCC licenses represent the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The estimated fair value also assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use
of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.  A basic assumption in
our valuation of these FCC licenses was that these radio stations were new radio stations, signing on-the-air as of the date of the valuation. We assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date, except that these
stations were just beginning operations. In doing so, we bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired, and strictly valued the FCC licenses. 
In estimating the value of the AM and FM licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis we began with market revenue
projections. Next, we estimated the percentage of the markets total revenue, or market share, that market participants could reasonably expect an average start-up station to attain, as well as the duration (in years) required to reach the
average market share. The estimated average market share was computed based on market share data, by type (i.e., AM and FM).  After market revenue and market shares have been estimated, operating expenses, including depreciation based on assumed investment in fixed assets and future capital expenditures, of a start-up station or
operation are similarly estimated based on industry-average cost data. Appropriate income taxes are then subtracted, depreciation added back, estimated capital expenditures subtracted, and working capital adjustments are made to calculate free cash
flow during the build-up period until a steady state or mature normalized operation is achieved. 
We discounted the net free cash flows using an after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.0%, and then calculated
the total discounted net free cash flows. For net free cash flows beyond the projection period, we estimated a perpetuity value, and then discounted the amounts to present values. 
In order to estimate what listening audience share would be expected for each station by market, we analyzed the average
local commercial share garnered by similar AM and FM stations competing in those radio markets. Often we made adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on the stations signal coverage of the market and the surrounding area
population as compared to the other stations in the market. Based on our knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets, we determined that approximately three years would be required for the stations to reach maturity. We also
incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model:   


 

 
 the projected operating revenues and expenses through 2015; 
 


 

 
 the estimation of initial and on-going capital expenditures (based on market size); 
 


 

 
 depreciation on initial and on-going capital expenditures (we calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines over
five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on-the-air);   


 

 
 the estimation of working capital requirements (based on working capital requirements for comparable companies); 
 


 

 
 the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital; and 
 


 

 
 amortization of the intangible assetthe FCC license (we calculated amortization on a straight line basis over 15 years).
 The table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the
carrying value of radio broadcasting licenses for 111 geographical markets under the Step 1 test as of December 31, 2011. Managements opinion is that the summary form of this table is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the
recoverability of the broadcasting licenses.

 Valuation Allowance on Deferred Taxes 
In connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of ASC 350, the reversal of
our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry-forward period. We have a valuation allowance of approximately $201.2 million as of December 31, 2011 based on our
assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carry-forwards (and certain other deferred tax assets) will be realized. Should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of
these net deferred tax assets in the future, reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made  Stock-based Compensation Expense  Stock-based
compensation expense recognized under ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Share-Based Payment (ASC 718), for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.9 million
respectively, before income taxes, including $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the modified liability awards further discussed at Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Upon adopting ASC 718, for
awards with service conditions, a one-time election was made to recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For options with service conditions only, we utilized the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued. For restricted stock awards with service conditions, we utilized the intrinsic value method. For restricted stock awards with performance conditions, we have evaluated the
probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and have adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment. The fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. If
other reasonable assumptions were used, the results could differ.  Trade Transactions 
We provide advertising time in exchange for certain products, supplies and services. We include the value of such
exchanges in both station revenues and station operating expenses. Trade valuation is based upon our managements estimate of the fair value of the products, supplies and services received. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, amounts reflected under trade transactions were: (1) trade revenues of $21.2 million, $16.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively; and (2) trade expenses of $20.8 million, $16.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  ASU 2010-28. In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) provided additional guidance for performing Step 1 of the test for goodwill impairment when an entity
has reporting units with zero or negative carrying values. This Accounting Standards Update (ASU) updates ASC 350 to amend the criteria for performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
carrying amounts and requires performing Step 2 if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The Company adopted this guidance effective on January 1, 2011. The update did not have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2010-29. In
December 2010, the FASB issued clarification of the accounting guidance related to disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occur in the current reporting period. The guidance requires companies to present pro forma
information in their comparative financial statements as if the acquisition date for any business combination that occurred in the current reporting period had occurred at the beginning of the prior year reporting period. The Company adopted this
guidance effective January 1, 2011. ASU 2010-29 is a disclosure only clarification and its adoption had no impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operation. The Company has included the disclosures required pursuant to
this guidance in this Report. 
  57 


Table of Contents
ASU 2011-04. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, which
amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This standard gives
clarification for the highest and best use valuation concepts. The ASU also provides guidance on fair value measurements relating to instruments classified in stockholders equity and instruments managed within a portfolio. Further, ASU 2011-04
clarifies disclosures for financial instruments categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy that require companies to provide quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, the sensitivity of the measurement to changes in those
inputs, and the valuation processes used by the reporting entity. The Company is currently evaluating the newly prescribed disclosures but does not expect they will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
ASU 2011-05. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, which amends the guidance in Topic 220,
Comprehensive Income, by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of stockholders equity. Instead, the guidance now requires entities to present all non-owner
changes in stockholders equity either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The components of OCI have not changed nor has the guidance on
when OCI items are reclassified to net income. Similarly, ASU 2011-05 does not change the guidance to disclose OCI components gross or net of the effect of income taxes, provided that the tax effects are presented on the face of the statement in
which OCI is presented, or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements.  ASU 2011-8. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-8, which amends ASC
350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The amendments in this ASU give companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50.0%) that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, a company is not required to perform this two-step test. Under the amendments in this
ASU, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company adopted this guidance effective
January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2011-11. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11. The amendments in this ASU require companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its
financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The ASU is required to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented and is effective for annual periods for fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
Interest Rate Risk  As of December 31, 2011, 76.3% of our long-term debt, or $2.3 billion, bore interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our earnings and after-tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates.
Assuming the level of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011 at variable interest rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the 2011 average interest rate payable on these borrowings, it is estimated that our 2011 interest
expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by $28.8 million. As part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk, in December 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with JPMorgan that effectively fixed the
interest rate, based on LIBOR, on $71.3 million of our variable rate borrowings. The agreement caps the LIBOR-based variable interest rate component of our long-term debt at a maximum of 3.0% on an equivalent amount of our term loans. This agreement
is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes. After giving effect to the impact of this agreement, we had $2.2 billion of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011 that
were not subject to the interest rate cap. Assuming a one percentage point change in the 2011 average interest rate payable on these borrowings, it is estimated that our 2011 interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased
by $0.7 million.  In certain prior periods, we managed our interest rate risk on a portion of our variable
rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements in which we received payments based on variable interest rates and made payments based on a fixed interest rate. These swap agreements expired on March 13, 2011. In the event of an
adverse change in interest rates, our management would likely take actions, in addition to the interest rate cap agreement discussed above, to mitigate our exposure. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, additional analysis is not possible at this time.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange
Act designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (the principal executive and principal financial officers, respectively), as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. At the end of the period covered by this Report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and, while our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under
circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any
control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.  (b) Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management has excluded Citadel from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because
this company was acquired by Cumulus in a purchase business combination in September 2011 Citadel is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately $558.0 million and $212.4 million, respectively, of the
related consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cumulus Media Inc.: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations, of stockholders deficit and comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cumulus Media Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Citadel
from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in September 2011. We have also excluded Citadel from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Citadel is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose total assets and total revenues represented $558.0 million and $212.4 million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of
the year ended December 31, 2011.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

CUMULUS MEDIA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
1. Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
Description of Business 
Cumulus Media Inc. (and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as the context may otherwise require, Cumulus,
Cumulus Media, we, us, our, or the Company) is a Delaware corporation, organized in 2002, and successor by merger to an Illinois corporation with the same name that had been organized in
1997.  On August 1, 2011, Cumulus completed its previously announced acquisition of the remaining 75.0%
of the equity interests of CMP that it did not already own (the CMP Acquisition). As a result of the CMP Acquisition, CMP became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CMPs operating results have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of the completion of the CMP Acquisition. Prior to the completion of the CMP Acquisition, Cumulus had operated CMPs business pursuant to a management agreement since 2006. In
connection with the CMP Acquisition, Cumulus issued 9.9 million shares of its common stock to affiliates of the three private equity firms that collectively owned the 75.0% of CMP not then-owned by Cumulus. Also in connection with the CMP
Acquisition, 3.7 million outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock of a subsidiary of CMP were amended to instead become exercisable for up to 8.3 million shares of Class B common stock of Cumulus (see Note 9,
Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).  On September 16, 2011, Cumulus completed its
previously announced acquisition of Citadel (the Citadel Acquisition) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, consisting of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, the issuance of 23.6 million shares of
the Companys Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A common stock), including 0.9 million restricted shares, warrants to purchase 47.6 million shares of Class A common stock,
2.4 million warrants held in reserve for potential future issuance related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims arising from Citadels emergence from bankruptcy, and the consideration to settle the debt
of Citadel. As a result of the Citadel Acquisition, Citadel became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Citadels operating results have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of the
completion of the Citadel Acquisition (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions).  Also on
September 16, 2011 and in connection with the Citadel Acquisition, the Company issued and sold 51.8 million shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock to Crestview,
125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to Macquarie, and 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 24.1 million shares of Class A common stock to UBS and certain other
entities.  In connection with the closing of the Citadel Acquisition and the completion of the Companys
previously announced related global refinancing (the Global Refinancing), on September 16, 2011, the Company repaid approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding senior or subordinated indebtedness and other obligations of
(a) the Company, (b) certain of the Companys other wholly-owned subsidiaries, and (c) Citadel. This Global Refinancing, and the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel Acquisition, were funded with
(i) $1.325 billion in borrowings under a new first lien term loan, $200.0 million in borrowings under a new first lien revolving credit facility and $790.0 million in borrowings under a new second lien term loan, all as described
in more detail in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, and (ii) proceeds from the sale of $475.0 million of Cumulus Medias common stock, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors (the Equity
Investment) in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). The $610.0 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 7.75% Senior Notes) issued
by the Company in May 2011 remain outstanding (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions). 
Also in connection with the Citadel Acquisition and as part of the transactions contemplated by the Global Refinancing,
during the three months ended September 30, 2011, the Company completed an internal restructuring into a holding company structure, which included transferring the remaining assets and operations held directly or indirectly by the Company,
other than the equity interests of its direct wholly-owned subsidiary Cumulus Media Holdings Inc. (Cumulus Holdings), to Cumulus Holdings (the Internal Restructuring). In connection with the Internal Restructuring, all
obligations under the 7.75% Senior Notes were assigned to and assumed by Cumulus Holdings, which was substituted for the Company as the issuer and primary obligor thereunder, and the Company provided a guarantee of all such obligations of Cumulus
Holdings.

Table of Contents
CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
Each of the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition has been
accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the respective purchase prices were allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. For additional information on the allocation of the purchase price related to each such acquisition (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions). 
Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Reportable Segment  The Company operates under one reportable business segment, radio broadcasting, for which segment disclosure is consistent with the management decision-making process that determines the allocation of
resources and the measuring of performance.  Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, intangible assets, derivative financial instruments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, restructuring and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risks  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
Companys existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on several factors including the length of time receivables are past due, trends and current economic factors. All balances are reviewed and evaluated on a
consolidated basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related
to its customers.  In the opinion of management, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited
due to the large number of customers and the geographic diversification of the Companys customer base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and believes that adequate allowances for any uncollectible accounts
receivable are maintained.  Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property and equipment acquired in business combinations are recorded at their
estimated fair values on the date of acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. 
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Equipment held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. Depreciation of construction in
progress is not recorded until the assets are placed into service.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets.  Intangible Assets and Goodwill  The Companys
intangible assets are comprised of broadcast licenses, certain other intangible assets and goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a business
combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life, which include the Companys broadcast licenses, are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment.  In determining that the Companys broadcast licenses qualified as indefinite lived intangibles, management considered a variety of factors including the Federal Communications Commissions
(FCC) historical record of renewing broadcast licenses, the very low cost to the Company of renewing such licenses, the relative stability and predictability of the radio industry and the relatively low level of capital investment
required to maintain the physical plant of a radio station. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite-lived assets, which include broadcasting licenses, goodwill, deferred charges, and other assets, using judgments and estimates.
Future events may impact these judgments and estimates. If events or changes in circumstances were to indicate that an assets carrying value is not recoverable, a write-down of the asset would be recorded through a charge to operations.
 Debt Issuance Costs  The costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized using the effective interest method to interest expense over the life of the related debt. 
Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company recognizes all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Fair value changes are recorded in income for any contracts not classified as qualifying hedging instruments. For
derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedge instruments, the effective portion of the derivative fair value change is recorded through other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity (deficit). 
Revenue Recognition  Revenue is derived primarily from the sale of commercial airtime to local and national advertisers. Revenue is recognized as commercials are broadcast. Revenues presented in the financial statements are
reflected on a net basis, after the deduction of advertising agency fees by the advertising agencies, usually at a rate of 15.0%.  Local Marketing Agreements  In certain
circumstances, the Company enters into a local marketing agreement (LMA) or time brokerage agreement with a FCC licensee of a radio station. In a typical LMA, the licensee of the station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its station
to a party, which supplies programming to be broadcast on that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. Revenues earned and LMA fees incurred pursuant to local marketing agreements or time brokerage agreements
are recognized at their gross amounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
As of December 31, 2011, the Company owned or operated 32 radio
stations under LMAs. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company operated 12 radio stations under LMAs. The stations operated under LMAs contributed $4.1 million, $10.6 million, and $9.2 million, in years 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively, to the consolidated net revenues of the Company.  Stock-based Compensation Expense 
Stock-based compensation expense recognized under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718,
Compensation  Share-Based Payment (ASC 718), for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.9 million respectively, before income taxes, including $4.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the modified liability awards further discussed at Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Upon adopting ASC 718 for awards with service conditions, a one-time election was made to
recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For options with service conditions only, the Company utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value
of options issued. For restricted stock awards with service conditions, the Company utilized the intrinsic value method. For restricted stock awards with performance conditions, the Company evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each
reporting period and adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment. The fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. If other assumptions were used, the results could
differ.  Trade Transactions 
The Company provides commercial airtime in exchange for goods and services used principally for promotional, sales and
other business activities. An asset and liability is recorded at the fair market value of the goods or services received. Trade revenue is recorded and the liability is relieved when commercials are broadcast and trade expense is recorded and the
asset relieved when goods or services are consumed. Trade valuation is based upon managements estimate of the fair value of the products, supplies and services received. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, amounts
reflected under trade transactions were: (1) trade revenues of $21.2 million, $16.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively; and (2) trade expenses of $20.8 million, $16.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively. 
Income Taxes  The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of the
Companys assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded for a net deferred tax asset balance
when it is more likely than not that the benefits of the tax asset will not be realized. The Company continues to assess the need for its deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Any adjustment to the
deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement of the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. See Note 12, Income Taxes for further discussion. 
Earnings per Share  Basic income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The Company allocates undistributed net income after any allocations for preferred stock
dividends between each class of common stock on an equal basis in accordance with the terms of the Companys third amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Third Amended and Restated Charter). 
Non-vested restricted shares of Class A common stock and the Company Warrants are considered participating
securities for purposes of calculating basic weighted average common shares outstanding in periods in which the Company records net income. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings per share after assuming issuance
of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent shares, which includes stock options and certain warrants to purchase common stock. Antidilutive instruments are not considered in this calculation. Under the two-class method, net income is
allocated to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security may share in earnings, as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. Earnings are allocated to each participating security and common share
equally, after deducting dividends declared or accreted on preferred stock.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments (See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements).  Accounting for National
Advertising Agency Contract  The Company has engaged Katz Media Group, Inc. (Katz) as its
national advertising sales agent. The Companys contract with Katz has several economic elements that principally reduce the overall expected commission rate below the stated base rate. The Company estimates the overall expected commission rate
over the entire contract period and applies that rate to commissionable revenue throughout the contract period with the goal of estimating and recording a stable commission rate over the life of the contract. 
The potential commission adjustments are estimated and combined in the consolidated balance sheets with the contractual
termination liability. That liability is accreted to commission expense to effectuate the stable commission rate over the term of the Katz contract.  The Companys accounting for and calculation of commission expense to be realized over the life of the Katz contract requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts
of commission expense. Actual results may differ from managements estimates. Over the term of the contract with Katz, management will continually update its assessment of the effective commission expense attributable to national sales in an
effort to record a consistent commission rate in each period.  Variable Interest Entities 
The Company accounts for entities qualifying as variable interest entities (VIEs) in accordance with ASC
Topic 810, Consolidation (ASC 810). VIEs are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the variable interest entity. A VIE
is an entity for which the primary beneficiarys interest in the entity can change with changes in factors other than the amount of investment in the entity. From time to time, the Company enters into LMAs in connection with pending
acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations and the requirements of ASC 810 may apply, depending on the facts and circumstances related to each transaction. As of December 31, 2011, ASC 810 did not apply to any LMAs. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  ASU 2010-28. In December 2010, the FASB provided additional guidance for performing Step 1 of the test for goodwill impairment when an entity has reporting units with zero or negative carrying
values. This Accounting Standards Update (ASU) updates ASC Topic 350 to amend the criteria for performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing Step 2 of
the test if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The Company adopted this guidance effective on January 1, 2011. The update did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2010-29. In December 2010, the FASB issued clarification
of the accounting guidance related to disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occur in the current reporting period. The guidance requires companies to present pro forma information in their comparative financial
statements as if the acquisition date for any business combination that occurred in the current reporting period had occurred at the beginning of the prior year reporting period. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2011 and
have included required disclosures in Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions.  ASU 2011-04.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, which amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). This standard gives clarification for the highest and best use valuation concepts. The ASU also provides guidance on fair value measurements relating to instruments classified in stockholders equity and
instruments managed within a portfolio. Further, ASU 2011-04 clarifies disclosures for financial instruments categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy that require companies to provide quantitative information about unobservable inputs
used, the sensitivity of the measurement to changes in those inputs, and the valuation processes used by the reporting entity. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2012. The Company is
currently evaluating the newly prescribed disclosures but does not expect they will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
ASU 2011-05. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, which
amends the guidance in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of stockholders equity. Instead, the new guidance now
requires entities to present all non-owner changes in stockholders equity either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The components of OCI
have not changed nor has the guidance on when OCI items are reclassified to net income. Similarly, ASU 2011-05 does not change the guidance to disclose OCI components gross or net of the effect of income taxes, provided that the tax effects are
presented on the face of the statement in which OCI is presented, or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2011-8. In September 2011, the FASB issued
ASU 2011-8, which amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The amendments in this ASU give companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than
50.0%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, a company is not required to perform this two-step test.
Under the amendments in this ASU, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company adopted this
guidance effective January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2011-11. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11. The amendments in this ASU require companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its
financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The ASU is required to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented and is effective for annual periods for fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
2. Acquisitions and Dispositions 
2011 Acquisitions  Ann Arbor, Battle Creek and Canton Asset Exchange 
On February 18, 2011, the Company completed an asset exchange with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. (Clear
Channel). As part of the asset exchange, Cumulus acquired eight of Clear Channels radio stations located in Ann Arbor and Battle Creek, Michigan in exchange for its radio station in Canton, Ohio. The Company disposed of two of the Battle
Creek stations simultaneously with the closing of the transaction to comply with FCC broadcast ownership limits. The asset exchange was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with FASBs guidance. The fair value of the assets
acquired in the asset exchange was $17.4 million. The Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in acquisition costs related to this transaction and expensed them as incurred through earnings within corporate, general and administrative
expense. The $4.3 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations for the Ann Arbor and Battle Creek stations acquired, which were not material, have been included in our statements of operations since
2007 when the Company entered into an LMA with Clear Channel to manage the stations. Prior to the asset exchange, the Company did not have any preexisting relationship with Clear Channel with regard to the Canton, Ohio market. 
In conjunction with this asset exchange, the Company recorded a net gain of $15.3 million, which is included in gain
on exchange of assets or stations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  The table below summarizes the final purchase

CMP Acquisition 
On August 1, 2011, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of the remaining 75.0% of the equity
interests of CMP that it did not already own. The Company had owned 25.0% of CMPs equity interests since it, together with Bain Capital Partners, LLC (Bain), The Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone) and Thomas H. Lee
Partners, L.P. (THL, and together with Bain and Blackstone, the CMP Sellers), formed CMP in 2005. Pursuant to a management agreement, the Company had been operating CMPs business since 2006. This management agreement
was terminated in connection with the completion of the CMP Acquisition. In connection with the CMP Acquisition, the Company issued 9.9 million shares of its common stock to affiliates of the CMP Sellers. Blackstone received 3.3 million
shares of the Companys Class A common stock and, in accordance with FCC broadcast ownership rules, Bain and THL each received 3.3 million shares of a newly authorized Class D non-voting common stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the Class D common stock). This Class D common stock was subsequently converted into an equivalent number of shares of the Companys Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class B common
stock), with substantially identical terms, pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Charter filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and effective upon the effectiveness of the Citadel Acquisition (discussed
below). Also in connection with the CMP Acquisition, outstanding warrants to purchase 3.7 million shares of common stock of Radio Holdings (the CMP Restated Warrants) were amended to instead become exercisable for up to
8.3 million shares of the Companys common stock.  As a component of the CMP Acquisition, the
Company acquired an interest in the San Francisco Baseball Associates L.P. The fair value of the investment as of the acquisition date was $9.8 million. The investment is included in other long-term assets on the Companys consolidated balance
sheet and is carried under the cost method.  As another component of the CMP Acquisition, the Company acquired
CMP KC, LLC (KC LLC), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of CMP. On February 2, 2011, the direct parent company of KC LLC entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) regarding the
restructuring of KC LLCs debt with the lenders under KC LLCs credit facilities (the Restructuring). As part of the Restructuring, KC LLC was renamed AR Broadcasting, LLC (AR Broadcasting). The Restructuring was
completed in February 2012. As a result of the completion of the Restructuring, the Company no longer has an ownership interest in AR Broadcasting. However, the Company has entered into a management agreement, similar to an LMA, pursuant to which
the Company will provide corporate management and other services to AR Broadcasting and its subsidiaries. The Company has determined that Cumulus is not the primary beneficiary of AR Broadcasting and Cumulus did not consolidate AR Broadcasting, in
accordance with the guidance for VIEs.  Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations,
a preliminary purchase price for the CMP Acquisition has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill as of the acquisition date was
measured as the excess of consideration over the net acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represent managements estimates based on
information available as of the date of acquisition. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets and residual goodwill Management
expects to continue to obtain information to assist in finalizing these preliminary valuations during the measurement period. The Company fair valued its historical 25.0% equity interest in CMP and recorded a gain of $11.6 million, the difference
between the fair value at acquisition and the carrying value, which was zero, given CMPs historical losses. With respect to certain outstanding preferred stock of CMP, the Company recorded $0.5 million in dividends for the period from
August 1, 2011, the acquisition date, to September 16, 2011. This preferred stock was redeemed on September 16, 2011 for approximately $41.6 million. 
Revenues of $75.9 million attributable to CMP since August 1, 2011 are included in our accompanying
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price in the CMP
Acquisition is as follows (dollars in thousands):

and liabilities. $403.9 million of the acquired goodwill balance is non-deductible for tax purposes. Among the factors considered by management that contributed to the purchase price allocation resulting in the recognition of goodwill were
CMPs high operating margins, strong sales force and employee base, and its overall market presence.  The
indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in the CMP Acquisition consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill. The definite-lived intangible assets acquired in the CMP Acquisition are being amortized in relation to the economic benefits of such

 Citadel Acquisition 
The Company completed the Citadel Acquisition on September 16, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$2.3 billion, consisting of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, the issuance of 23.6 million shares of the Companys Class A common stock, including 0.9 million restricted shares, warrants to purchase 47.6 million shares of
Class A common stock, 2.4 million warrants held in reserve for potential future issuance related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims arising from Citadels emergence from bankruptcy, and the
consideration to repay the outstanding debt of Citadel. As a result of the Citadel Acquisition, Citadel became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Citadels operating results have been included in Cumulus accompanying
audited consolidated financial statements since the date of the completion of the Citadel Acquisition.  Also
on September 16, 2011 and in connection with the Citadel Acquisition, the Company issued and sold 51.8 million shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock to an
affiliate of Crestview, 125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to an affiliate of Macquarie, and 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 24.1 million shares of Class A
common stock to UBS and certain other entities.

In connection with the closing of the Citadel Acquisition and the
completion of the Companys previously announced Global Refinancing, on September 16, 2011, the Company repaid approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding senior or subordinated indebtedness and other obligations of (a) the Company,
(b) certain of our other wholly-owned subsidiaries, and (c) Citadel. This Global Refinancing, and the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel Acquisition, were funded with (i) $1.325 billion in borrowings under a new
first lien term loan, $200.0 million in borrowings under a new first lien revolving credit facility and $790.0 million in borrowings under a new second lien term loan, all as described in more detail in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, and
(ii) proceeds from the sale of $475.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The $610.0
million of 7.75% Senior Notes issued by us in May 2011 remained outstanding.  In connection with the closing
of, and in order to fund a portion of the purchase price payable in the Citadel Acquisition, the Company entered into and completed the transactions contemplated by the Equity Investment (see Note 9, Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).
Also in connection therewith, the Company completed its previously announced Internal Restructuring (see Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
In connection with the Citadel Acquisition, the Company agreed that it would divest certain stations to comply with FCC
ownership limits. These stations were assigned to a trustee under divestiture trusts that comply with FCC rules. The trust agreements stipulate that the Company must fund any operating shortfalls of the activities of the stations in the trusts, and
any excess cash flow generated by such stations will be distributed to the Company. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the trusts and consolidates the trusts accordingly. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, a preliminary purchase price has been allocated to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the
acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represent managements estimates based on information available as of the date of acquisition. The
primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets and residual goodwill Management expects to continue to obtain information to assist in
finalizing these preliminary valuations during the measurement period.  Revenues of $212.4 million
attributable to Citadel since September 16, 2011 are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price in the Citadel Acquisition is as follows (dollars in thousands):

 The following pro forma information assumes the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel
Acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the prior years reporting period. The pro forma financial information also includes the business combination accounting effects from the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition, including
Cumuluss amortization expense resulting from acquired intangible assets, the elimination of certain intangible asset amortization expense incurred by CMP and Citadel, adjustments to interest expense for certain borrowings, adjustments for

 The Company has significant intangible assets recorded and these intangible assets are
comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations. The Company reviews the carrying value of its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually for impairment. If the
carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value, the Company calculates the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its estimated fair value and charges the impairment to results of operations. 
Total amortization expense related to the Companys intangible assets was $37.9 million, $0.0 million and $0.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, estimated future amortization expenses related to the intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (dollars in millions):

 Goodwill  2011 Impairment Testing  The Company performs its
annual impairment testing of goodwill during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach
and discounted cash flow methodology. As part of its overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill, the Company determined that its geographic markets are the appropriate reporting unit. 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company performed its annual impairment test. The assumptions used in estimating
the fair values of reporting units are based on currently available data at the time the test is conducted and managements best estimates and accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the
estimated values.  Step 1 Goodwill Test 
The Company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis, an income
approach. The discounted cash flow approach requires the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate. The Company used an approximate five-year projection period to
derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view. The Company made certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data and historical performance. The Company then projected future operating
expenses in order to derive operating profits, which the Company combined with working capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
The Company performed the Step 1 test and compared the fair value of
each market to the carrying value of its net assets as of December 31, 2011. This test was used to determine if any of the Companys markets have an indicator of impairment (i.e. the market net asset carrying value was greater than
the calculated fair value of the market).  The Companys analysis determined that, based on the Step 1
test, the fair value of all the Companys markets containing goodwill balances was above their carrying value. Since no impairment indicator existed in Step 1, the Company determined goodwill was appropriately stated as of December 31,
2011.  The discount rate employed in the fair value calculations in the Step 1 test in the Companys
markets was 10.0%. The Company believes this discount rate was appropriate and reasonable for estimating the fair value of the markets.  For periods after 2011, the Company projected annual revenue growth based on industry data and historical performance. The Company projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical
financial performance and expected growth. The Companys projections were based on then-current market and economic conditions and the Companys historical knowledge of the markets. 
To validate the Companys conclusions and determine the reasonableness of the Companys assumptions, the
Company conducted an overall check of the Companys fair value calculations by comparing the implied fair value of the Companys markets, in aggregate, to the Companys market capitalization as of December 31, 2011. As compared
with the market capitalization value of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately $4.2 billion was approximately $464.6 million, or 12.5%, higher than the market capitalization. 
Key data points included in the market capitalization calculation were as follows: 
 


 

 
 shares outstanding, including certain warrants, of 216.0 million as of December 31, 2011; 
 


 

 
 closing price of the Companys Class A common stock on December 30, 2011 of $3.34 per share; and 
 


 

 
 total debt, including preferred equity, of $2,995.5 million, on December 31, 2011. 
Utilizing the above analyses and data points, the Company concluded the fair values of the Companys markets, as
calculated, are appropriate and reasonable.  Step 2 Goodwill Test 
The Company did not need to perform a Step 2 test in 2011 since the Step 1 test did not indicate a potential impairment. 
Indefinite Lived Intangibles (FCC Licenses) 
The Company performs its annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles (the Companys FCC licenses)
during the fourth quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company has combined all of the Companys broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a
single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes. As part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite-lived intangibles test, the Company determined that the Companys geographic markets are the appropriate unit of
accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing.  For the annual impairment test of the Companys
FCC licenses, including both AM and FM licenses, the Company utilized the income approach, specifically the Greenfield Method, with the exception of two stations which the Company was not operating as of the valuation date. A minimum value of fifty
thousand dollars was estimated for the FCC licenses of these two non-operating stations. In completing the appraisals, the Company conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued. 
The income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject property, which is then analyzed and
projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value. The Greenfield Method isolates cash flows attributable to the subject asset using a hypothetical start-up approach. 
The estimated fair values of the Companys FCC licenses represent the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between the Company and willing market participants at the measurement date. The estimated fair value also assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering
the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
A basic assumption in the Companys valuation of these FCC licenses
was that these radio stations were new radio stations, signing on-the-air as of the date of the valuation. The Company assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date, except that these stations were just beginning
operations. In doing so, the Company bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired, and strictly valued the FCC licenses.  In estimating the value of the licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis the Company began with market revenue projections. Next, the Company estimated the percentage of the markets total
revenue, or market share, that market participants could reasonably expect an average start-up station to attain, as the well as the duration (in years) required to reach the average market share. The estimated average market share was computed
based on market share data, by type (i.e., AM and FM).  After market revenue and market shares have been
estimated, operating expenses, including depreciation based on assumed investment in fixed assets and future capital expenditures, of a start-up station or operation are similarly estimated based on industry-average cost data. Appropriate income
taxes are then subtracted, depreciation added back, estimated capital expenditures subtracted, and working capital adjustments are made to calculate free cash flow during the build-up period until a steady state or mature normalized
operation is achieved.  The Company discounted the net free cash flows using an after-tax the weighted average
cost of capital of 10.0%, and then calculated the total discounted net free cash flows. For net free cash flows beyond the projection period, the Company estimated a perpetuity value, and then discounted the amounts to present values. 
In order to estimate what listening audience share would be expected for each station by market, the Company analyzed the
average local commercial share garnered by similar AM and FM stations competing in those radio markets. The Company made any appropriate adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on the stations signal coverage of the market
and the surrounding area population as compared to the other stations in the market. Based on the Companys knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets, the Company determined that approximately three years would be required
for the stations to reach maturity. The Company also incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model:   


 

 
 the projected operating revenues and expenses through 2016; 
 


 

 
 the estimation of initial and on-going capital expenditures (based on market size); 
 


 

 
 depreciation on initial and on-going capital expenditures (the Company calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines
over five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on-the-air);   


 

 
 the estimation of working capital requirements (based on working capital requirements for comparable companies); 
 


 

 
 the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital; and 
 


 

 
 amortization of the intangible assetthe FCC license (the Company calculated amortization on a straight line basis over 15 years).
 As a result of the annual impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011, the
Company determined that no impairment existed for the FCC licenses.

6. Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of the following: 
May 2005 Swap  In May 2005, the Company entered into a forward-starting LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangement (the May 2005 Swap) to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest
rate risk attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR. The May 2005 Swap became effective as of March 13, 2006, the end of the term of the Companys prior swap. The May 2005 Swap expired on March 13,
2009, in accordance with the terms of the original agreement. Accordingly, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not record any interest expense related to the May 2005 Swap. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, the Company recorded interest income of $3.0 million from the May 2005 Swap.  The
May 2005 Swap changed the variable-rate cash flow exposure on $400.0 million of the Companys long-term bank borrowings to fixed-rate cash flows. Under the May 2005 Swap the Company received LIBOR-based variable interest rate
payments and made fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate long-term debt. The May 2005 Swap did not qualify as a cash flow hedging instrument for any period presented. Accordingly, the changes in its fair value were reflected
in the statement of operations instead of accumulated other comprehensive income.  May 2005 Option 
In May 2005, the Company also entered into an interest rate option agreement (the May 2005 Option),
that provided Bank of America, N.A. the right to enter into an underlying swap agreement with the Company for two years, from March 13, 2009 through March 13, 2011. 
The May 2005 Option was exercised effective March 11, 2009. This instrument was not highly effective in mitigating
the risks in the Companys cash flows, and therefore the Company deemed it speculative, and accounted for changes in the May 2005 Options value as interest expense. The May 2005 Option expired on March 31, 2011. The Companys
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflect current liabilities of $0.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, to include the fair value of the May 2005 Option. The Company reported interest income of $3.7 million
and $12.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and interest expense of $0.2 million, inclusive of the fair value adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2009.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
Interest Rate Cap 
On December 8, 2011, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with JPMorgan to limit the
Companys exposure to interest rate risk. The interest rate cap has an aggregate notional amount of $71.3 million. The agreement caps the LIBOR-based variable interest rate component of the Companys long-term debt at a maximum of 3.0% on
an equivalent amount of the Companys term loans. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 includes long-term assets of $0.4 million attributable to the fair value of the interest rate cap. The Company reported interest
expense of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, inclusive of the change in fair value adjustment. The interest rate cap matures on December 8, 2015. 
The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
Green Bay Option  On April 10, 2009, Clear Channel and the Company entered into an LMA whereby the Company is responsible for operating (i.e., programming, advertising, etc.) five Green Bay radio stations and must pay
Clear Channel a monthly fee of approximately $0.2 million over a five year term (expiring December 31, 2013), in exchange for the Company retaining the operating profits for managing the radio stations. Clear Channel also has a put option
(the Green Bay Option) that allows it to require the Company to repurchase the five Green Bay radio stations at any time during the two-month period commencing July 1, 2013 (or earlier if the LMA is terminated before this date) for
$17.6 million (the fair value of the radio stations as of April 10, 2009). The Company accounted for the Green Bay Option as a derivative contract. Accordingly, the fair value of the Green Bay Option was recorded as a liability offsetting
the gain at the acquisition date with subsequent changes in the fair value recorded through earnings. The fair value of the Green Bay Option was determined using inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (a Level 3
measurement). The fair value represents an estimate of the net amount that the Company would pay if the option was transferred to another party as of the date of the valuation. 
The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflect other long-term liabilities of
$11.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively to include the fair value of the Green Bay Option. Accordingly, the Company recorded $3.4 million and $2.0 million of expense in realized loss on derivative instruments associated with marking to
market the Green Bay Option to reflect the fair value of the option during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

7. Fair Value Measurements 
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy to be applied to financial instruments when determining
fair value are described below:  Level 1  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access;  Level 2 
Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities; and  Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  A financial
instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1)
 The Companys only derivative financial instrument is an interest rate cap pursuant to which the Company pays a fixed interest rate on a $71.3
million notional amount of its term loans. The fair value of the Companys interest rate cap is determined based on discounted cash flow analysis on the expected future cash flows using observable inputs, including interest rates and yield
curves. Derivative valuations incorporate adjustments that are necessary to reflect the credit risk.   


(2)
 The fair value of the Green Bay Option was determined using inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (a Level 3 measurement). The
fair value represents an estimate of the net amount that the Company would pay if the option was transferred to another party as of the date of the valuation. The option valuation incorporates a credit risk adjustment to reflect the probability of
default by the Company.  The assets associated with the Companys interest rate cap are
measured at Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of the interest rate cap, the Company used an industry standard cash valuation model, which utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, with all significant inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of the Companys interest rate cap was $0.4 million at December 31, 2011. The Company did not have a similar interest rate cap agreement in the year ended December 31,
2010.  The Company reported $3.4 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively, in realized loss on derivative instruments within the income statement related to fair value adjustment, representing the change in the fair value of the Green Bay Option.

 First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities 
On September 16, 2011 and in order to complete the Global Refinancing, the Company entered into a (i) First
Lien Credit Agreement (the First Lien Facility), among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan as Administrative Agent, UBS, Macquarie, Royal Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents, and
U.S. Bank National Association and Fifth Third Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents; and (ii) Second Lien Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Facility and, together with the First Lien Facility, the 2011 Credit Facilities),
among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan, as Administrative Agent, and UBS, Macquarie, Royal Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents. 
The First Lien Facility consists of a $1.325 billion first lien term loan facility, net of an original issue discount of
$13.5 million, maturing in September 2018 (the First Lien Term Loan), and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, maturing in September 2016 (the Revolving Credit Facility). Under the Revolving Credit Facility, up to
$30.0 million of availability may be drawn in the form of letters of credit and up to $30.0 million is available for swingline borrowings. The Second Lien Facility consists of a $790.0 million second lien term loan facility, net of an original issue
discount of $12.0 million, maturing in September 2019 (the Second Lien Term Loan).  At
December 31, 2011, there was $1.3 billion outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan, $150.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $790.0 million outstanding under the Second Lien Term Loan. 
Proceeds from borrowings under the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility were used, together with certain other
funds, to (i) fund the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the Citadel Acquisition; (ii) repay in full amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the Companys pre-existing credit agreement (the
Terminated Credit Agreement); (iii) repay all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of CMP Susquehanna Corporation (CMPSC), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CMP; (iv) redeem CMPSCs outstanding
9.875% senior subordinated notes due 2014 and variable rate senior secured notes due 2014; 
  F-25

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   

(v) redeem in accordance with their terms all outstanding shares of preferred stock of CMP Susquehanna Radio Holdings Corp., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CMP (Radio
Holdings) and the direct parent of CMPSC; and (vi) repay all amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and the premiums thereon, under Citadels pre-existing credit agreement and to redeem its 7.75% Senior Notes.
 Borrowings under the First Lien Facility bear interest, at the option of Cumulus Holdings, based on the Base
Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), in each case plus 4.5% on LIBOR-based borrowings and 3.5% on Base Rate-based borrowings. LIBOR-based borrowings are subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.25% for the First
Lien Term Loan and 1.0% for the Revolving Credit Facility. Base Rate-based borrowings are subject to a Base Rate Floor of 2.25% for the First Lien Term Loan and 2.0% for the Revolving Credit Facility. Base Rate is defined, for any day, as the
fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1.0%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan, as established from time to time,
and (iii) 30 day LIBOR plus 1.0%. The First Lien Term Loan amortizes at a per annum rate of 1.0% of the original principal amount of the First Lien Term Loan, payable quarterly, commencing March 31, 2012, with the balance payable on the
maturity date. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable on the maturity date.  Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility bear interest, at the option of Cumulus Holdings, at either the Base Rate plus 5.0%, subject to a Base Rate floor of 2.5%, or LIBOR plus 6.0%, subject to a LIBOR
floor of 1.5%.  Interest on Base Rate-based borrowings is due on the last day of each calendar quarter, except
with respect to swingline loans, for which interest is due on the day that such swingline loan is required to be repaid. Interest payments on loans whose interest rate is based upon LIBOR are due at maturity if the term is three months or less or
every three months and at maturity if the term exceeds three months.  At December 31, 2011, borrowings
under the First Lien Term Loan bore interest at 5.75% per annum, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 6.75% per annum and borrowings under the Second Lien Term Loan bore interest at 7.50% per annum.
Effective December 8, 2011, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with JPMorgan with an aggregate notional amount of $71.3 million, which agreement caps the interest rate on an equivalent amount of the Companys LIBOR
based term loans at a maximum of 3.0% per annum. The interest rate cap agreement matures on December 8, 2015. See Note 6, Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. 
The representations, covenants and events of default in the 2011 Credit Facilities and financial covenants in the First
Lien Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events of default in the 2011 Credit Facilities include, among others, (a) the failure to pay when due the obligations owing under the credit facilities; (b) the
failure to comply with (and not timely remedy, if applicable) certain financial covenants (as required by the First Lien Facility); (c) certain cross defaults and cross accelerations; (d) the occurrence of bankruptcy or insolvency events;
(e) certain judgments against the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries; (f) the loss, revocation or suspension of, or any material impairment in the ability to use one or more of, any material FCC licenses; (g) any
representation or warranty made, or report, certificate or financial statement delivered, to the lenders subsequently proven to have been incorrect in any material respect; and (h) the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the First
Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility, as applicable). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the First Lien Facility and the
Second Lien Facility, as applicable, and the ancillary loan documents as a secured party.  As a result of
amounts being outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2011, the First Lien Facility required compliance with a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 7.75 to 1.0 as of such date (and provides for reductions in such
ratio beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2012 if amounts remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility).  The First Lien Facility also requires our compliance with customary restrictive non-financial covenants, which, among other things, and with certain exceptions, limit the Companys ability to incur
or guarantee additional indebtedness; consummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and pay dividends or repurchase stock. 
At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of the required covenants under the First Lien
Facility. The Second Lien Facility does not contain any financial covenants.

Certain mandatory prepayments on the First Lien Term Loan and the Second
Lien Term Loan would be required upon the occurrence of specified events, including upon the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, upon the sale of certain assets and upon the occurrence of certain condemnation or casualty events, and from
excess cash flow.  The Companys, Cumulus Holdings and their respective restricted
subsidiaries obligations under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are collateralized by a first priority lien and second priority lien, respectively, on substantially all of the Companys, Cumulus Holdings and
their respective restricted subsidiaries assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted, including, without limitation, intellectual property and substantially all of the capital stock of the Companys direct and indirect
domestic subsidiaries and 66.0% of the capital stock of any future first-tier foreign subsidiaries. In addition, Cumulus Holdings obligations under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are guaranteed by the Company and
substantially all of its restricted subsidiaries, other than Cumulus Holdings.  7.75% Senior Notes 
On May 13, 2011, the Company issued $610.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Senior Notes. Proceeds
from the sale of the 7.75% Senior Notes were used to, among other things, repay the $575.8 million outstanding under the term loan facility under the Terminated Credit Agreement. 
In connection with the Internal Restructuring, on September 16, 2011, the Company and Cumulus Holdings entered into
a supplemental indenture with the trustee under the indenture governing the 7.75% Senior Notes which provided for, among other things, the (i) assumption by Cumulus Holdings of all obligations of the Company; (ii) substitution of Cumulus
Holdings for the Company as issuer; (iii) release of the Company from all obligations as original issuer; and (iv) Companys guarantee of all of Cumulus Holdings obligations, in each case under the indenture and the 7.75% Senior
Notes.  Interest on the 7.75% Senior Notes is payable on each May 1 and November 1, commencing
November 1, 2011. The 7.75% Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2019.  Cumulus Holdings, as issuer of the
7.75% Senior Notes, may redeem all or part of the 7.75% Senior Notes at any time on or after May 1, 2015. At any time prior to May 1, 2014, Cumulus Holdings may also redeem up to 35.0% of the 7.75% Senior Notes using the proceeds from
certain equity offerings. At any time prior to May 1, 2015, Cumulus Holdings may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium. If Cumulus Holdings sells
certain assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, it will be required to make an offer to purchase the 7.75% Senior Notes.  In connection with the substitution of Cumulus Holdings as the issuer of the 7.75% Senior Notes, the Company has also guaranteed the 7.75% Senior Notes. In addition, each existing and future domestic
restricted subsidiary that guarantees the Companys indebtedness, Cumulus Holdings indebtedness or indebtedness of the Companys subsidiary guarantors (other than the Companys subsidiaries that hold the licenses for the
Companys radio stations) guarantees, and will guarantee, the 7.75% Senior Notes. The 7.75% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Cumulus Holdings and rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured debt
of Cumulus Holdings and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated debt of Cumulus Holdings. The 7.75% Senior Notes guarantees are the Companys and the other guarantors senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of
payment to all of the Companys and the other guarantors existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the Companys and the other guarantors future subordinated debt. The 7.75% Senior Notes and the
guarantees are effectively subordinated to any of Cumulus Holdings, the Companys or the guarantors existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 7.75% Senior Notes
and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred stock, of the Companys non-guarantor subsidiaries, including all of the liabilities of the Companys and the guarantors
foreign subsidiaries and the Companys subsidiaries that hold the licenses for the Companys radio stations.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company capitalized $58.9 million in deferred financing costs for fees paid directly to lenders in connection with and recorded $25.5 million related to
debt discount on the issuance.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded an aggregate
of $4.4 million of amortization costs related to its First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities and 7.75% Senior Notes.

Terminated Credit Agreement 
As described above, all amounts outstanding under the Terminated Credit Agreement were repaid in full on
September 16, 2011, and such facility was terminated.  Previously, in connection with the completion of
the offering of the 7.75% Senior Notes and effective May 13, 2011 the Company entered into an amendment to the Terminated Credit Agreement. This amendment provided, among other things, the Company with the ability to complete the offering of
7.75% Senior Notes, provided that proceeds therefrom were used to repay in full the term loans then-outstanding under the Terminated Credit Agreement.  On July 23, 2010, the Company entered into an amendment to the Terminated Credit Agreement (the 2010 Amendment). Prior to entering into the 2010 Amendment, borrowings under the term loan
facility under the Terminated Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Companys option, at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.0% or the Alternate Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Wall Street Journals Prime Rate and the Federal Funds rate
plus 0.5%) plus 3.0%. In July 2010, the Company made aggregate principal payments of $32.5 million under the Terminated Credit Agreement in accordance with the Companys obligation to make such payments based on excess cash flow (as defined in
the Terminated Credit Agreement), which triggered a reduction in the Companys interest rate on borrowings thereunder to LIBOR plus 3.8% or the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.8%. At that time, the Terminated Credit Agreement also provided that once
the Company reduced the outstanding balance on the term loan thereunder by an aggregate of $50.0 million through further mandatory prepayments of excess cash flow, borrowings under the revolving credit facility would bear interest, at the
Companys option, at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.3% or the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.3%.  In connection
with the 2010 Amendment, the Company capitalized approximately $0.2 million in fees paid directly to the lenders under the Terminated Credit Agreement.  As of December 31, 2010, prior to giving effect to the May 2005 Swap, the effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Terminated Credit Agreement was approximately 4.0%. As of
December 31, 2010, the effective interest rate after giving effect to the May 2005 Swap was approximately 6.5%  On June 29, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to the Terminated Credit Agreement (the 2009 Amendment). The 2009 Amendment provided, among other things, additional operational
flexibility for the Company while maintaining the preexisting term loan facility thereunder of $750.0 million, which had an outstanding balance of approximately $647.9 million immediately after the closing of the 2009 Amendment, and reducing the
revolving credit facility availability from $100.0 million to $20.0 million.  In connection with the June 2009
Amendment the Company made a voluntary prepayment under the Terminated Credit Agreement of $32.5 million. The Company was also required to make quarterly mandatory prepayments of 100% of its excess cash flow through December 31, 2010 (while
maintaining a minimum balance of $7.5 million of cash on hand), before reverting to annual prepayments of a percentage of excess cash flow beginning in 2011.  Also in connection with the 2009 Amendment, the Company issued immediately exercisable warrants to the lenders that allow them to acquire up to 1.3 million shares of the Companys Class A common
stock at an exercise price of $1.17 per share (the 2009 Warrants. The 2009 Warrants have an expiration date of June 29, 2019.  The 2009 Amendment was accounted for as a loan modification and accordingly, the Company did not record a gain or a loss on the transaction. Also in connection therewith, the Company incurred
approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, based on the reduction of borrowing availability, and recorded $3.0 million of fees paid directly to the lenders as a debt discount, which fees were amortized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.  The Company also classified $0.8 million
related to the warrants as equity at fair value at the issuance date thereof. The fair value of the warrants was recorded as a debt discount and all fees were written off in conjunction with the 2011 Refinancing. 
9. Stockholders Equity (Deficit) 
The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 1,450,644,871 shares of stock divided into four
classes consisting of: (i) 750,000,000 shares designated as Class A common stock, (ii) 600,000,000 shares designated as Class B common stock, (iii) 644,871 shares designated as Class C common stock and
(iv) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $.01 per share (see Note 10, Redeemable Preferred Stock). Effective September 16, 2011, upon the filing of the Third Amended and Restated Charter, each
then-outstanding share of Class D common stock was converted to one share of Class B common stock.

As discussed in Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of
Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, the Company completed the CMP Acquisition on August 1, 2011. In connection with the CMP Acquisition, the Company issued

As also discussed in Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, and Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, the Company completed the Citadel Acquisition on September 16, 2011. In connection with the Citadel Acquisition, the Company issued 23.6 million shares of Class A
common stock, including 0.9 million restricted shares and warrants to purchase 47.6 million shares of Class A common stock (the Citadel Warrants) to holders of Citadels common stock and warrants. Additionally,
2.4 million warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims arising from Citadels emergence from bankruptcy in June 2010 are held in reserve
for potential future issuance by the Company.  On September 16, 2011, pursuant to the Equity Investment,
the Company issued and sold (i) 51.8 million shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock with an exercise price of $4.34 per share (the Crestview Warrants)
to an affiliate of Crestview; (ii) 125,000 shares of its newly created series of preferred stock to an affiliate of Macquarie (see Note 10, Redeemable Preferred Stock); and (iii) 4.7 million shares of Class A common
stock and warrants to purchase 24.1 million shares of Class A common stock (the UBS Warrants, and, together with the Citadel Warrants, the Company Warrants) to UBS and certain other investors to whom UBS syndicated
a portion of its investment commitment.  Gross proceeds from the September 16, 2011 issuances of equity
securities described above were $475.0 million. Direct issuance costs related to the issuances of the equity securities described above was $26.7 million, of which $16.2 million was paid as of December 31, 2011. 
Common Stock  Except with regard to voting and conversion rights, shares of Class A, Class B and Class C common stock are identical in all respects. The preferences, qualifications, limitations,
restrictions, and the special or relative rights in respect of the common stock and the various classes of common stock are as follows:   


 

 
 Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, and the holders of shares of Class C common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class C common stock held. Generally, the holders of shares of Class B common stock are not entitled to vote on any
matter. However, holders of Class B common stock and Class C common stock are entitled to a separate class vote on any amendment or modification of any specific rights or obligations of the holders of Class B common stock or
Class C common stock, respectively, that does not similarly affect the rights or obligations of the holders of Class A common stock. The holders of Class A common stock and of Class C common stock vote together, as a single


 
 Conversion. Each holder of Class B common stock and Class C common stock is entitled to convert at any time all or any part of such
holders shares into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock; provided, however, that to the extent that such conversion would result in the holder holding more than 4.99% of Class A common stock following such conversion,
the holder shall first deliver to the Company an ownership certification to enable the Company (a) to determine that such holder does not have an attributable interest in another entity that would cause the Company to violate applicable FCC
rules and regulations and (b) to obtain any necessary approvals from the FCC or the DOJ. 
After payment of any dividends to the holders of any stock entitled to payment in preference thereof (including the
Series A Preferred Stock (defined below)), the holders of the Companys common stock are entitled to share ratably in any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors of the Company. 
2009 Warrants  As described above, in June 2009, in connection with the execution of an amendment to the Terminated Credit Agreement, the Company issued the 2009 Warrants. The 2009 Warrants expire on June 29,
2019. Each 2009 Warrant is immediately exercisable to

purchase Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1.17 per share. The number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the 2009 Warrants is subject to adjustment
in certain circumstances, including upon the payment of a dividend in shares of Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 0.1 million 2009 Warrants were exercised and at December 31, 2011,
1.1 million 2009 Warrants remain outstanding.  CMP Restated Warrants 
As described above and in connection with the completion of the CMP Acquisition, Radio Holdings entered into an amended
and restated warrant agreement, dated as of August 1, 2011 (the Restated Warrant Agreement). Pursuant to the Restated Warrant Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the previously outstanding 3.7 million
Radio Holdings warrants were amended and restated to no longer be exercisable for shares of common stock of Radio Holdings but instead be exercisable, commencing on May 2, 2012 (the Exercise Date) at an exercise price of $.01 per
share, for an aggregate of 8.3 million shares of Class B common stock (subject to adjustments for rounding of fractional shares) (the CMP Restated Warrants). The CMP Restated Warrants expire upon the earlier of
(i) March 26, 2019 and (ii) the later of (A) the 30th day succeeding the redemption in full of all of Radio Holdings outstanding Series A preferred stock, and (b) the 90th day succeeding the Exercise Date.
 Equity Held in Reserve 
Citadel emerged from bankruptcy effective June 3, 2010 and, as of September 16, 2011, certain
bankruptcy-related claims against Citadel remained open for final resolution. As part of the Citadel Acquisition and as of December 31, 2011, warrants to purchase 2.4 million shares of the Companys common stock were reserved for
potential future issuance in connection with the settlement of these remaining allowed, disputed or unreconciled unsecured claims. If excess shares remain in reserve after resolution of all remaining allowed, disputed or unreconciled unsecured
claims, such shares will be distributed to the claimants with allowed unsecured claims pro-rata, based on the number of shares they received pursuant to the plan under which Citadel emerged from bankruptcy. This equity held in reserve is included in
additional paidin capital on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.  Company Warrants
 At the effective time of the Citadel Acquisition, the Company issued the Company Warrants. The
Company Warrants were issued under a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement), dated September 16, 2011, and the Company Warrants entitle the holders thereof to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock.
The Company Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to June 3, 2030 at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The exercise price of the Company Warrants is not subject to any anti-dilution protection, other than standard adjustments in the
case of stock splits, dividends and the like. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Warrant Agreement, upon the request of a holder, the Company has the discretion to issue, upon exercise of the Company Warrants, shares of Class B common
stock in lieu of an equal number of shares of Class A common stock and, upon request of a holder and at the Companys discretion, the Company has the right to exchange such warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of
Class B common stock for outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock. 
Conversion of the Company Warrants is subject to compliance with applicable FCC regulations, and the Company Warrants are
exercisable provided that ownership of the Companys securities by the holder does not cause the Company to violate applicable FCC rules and regulations relating to foreign ownership of broadcasting licenses. 
Holders of Company Warrants are entitled to participate ratably in any distributions on the Companys common stock
on an as-exercised basis. No distribution shall be made to holders of Company Warrants or common stock if (i) an FCC ruling, regulation or policy prohibits such distribution to holders of Company Warrants or (ii) the Companys FCC
counsel opines that such distribution is reasonably likely to cause (a) the Company to violate any applicable FCC rules or regulations or (b) any holder of Company Warrants to be deemed to hold an attributable interest in the Company.
 During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 17.6 million Company Warrants were converted
into shares of Class A common stock. At December 31, 2011, 54.1 million Company Warrants remained outstanding, including 30.0 million warrants issued to Citadel holders and 24.1 million warrants issued to UBS and certain
other entities.  Crestview Warrants 
Pursuant to the Equity Investment, but pursuant to a separate warrant agreement, the Company issued the Crestview
Warrants. The Crestview Warrants are exercisable until September 16, 2021 and the $4.34 per share exercise price is subject to standard weighted

average adjustments in the event that the Company issues additional shares of common stock or common stock derivatives for less than the fair market value per share as of the date of such
issuance. In addition, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Crestview Warrants, and the exercise price of the Crestview Warrants, are subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, dividends and the
like.  Share Repurchases 
On May 21, 2008, the Board of Directors of Cumulus (the Board) terminated all pre-existing repurchase
programs, and authorized the purchase, from time to time, of up to $75.0 million shares of Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made in the open market or through block trades, in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission
guidelines, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and various other factors, including compliance with the Companys 2011 Credit Facilities. Cumulus has no obligation to repurchase shares under the repurchase program, and
the timing, actual number and value of shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of the Companys stock price, general market conditions, and various other factors within the discretion of management. 
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its Class A
common stock under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased in the aggregate approximately 0.1 million shares of Class A common stock for approximately $0.2 million under this program.
 As of December 31, 2011, the Company had authority to repurchase an additional $68.3 million of its
Class A common stock under this program. 
10. Redeemable Preferred Stock 
The Company has designated 2,000,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series A
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (Series A Preferred Stock). As a part of the Equity Investment, the Company issued 125,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an
aggregate amount of $125.0 million. Net proceeds to the Company were $110.7 million, after deducting $14.3 million in fees. No other shares of Series A Preferred Stock are issuable in the future, except for such shares as may be
issued as dividends in lieu of any cash dividends in accordance with the terms thereof, and the Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to all common stock and each series of stock the Company may subsequently designate with respect to dividends,
redemption and distributions upon liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company.  The Series A
Preferred Stock has a perpetual term, a liquidation value equal to the amount invested therein plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, and dividend rights as described below. The Series A Preferred Stock generally does not have voting rights,
except with respect to any amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Charter that would adversely affect the rights, privileges or preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock. Although the shares of Series A Preferred Stock include a
mandatory redemption feature, there is no stated or probable date of redemption.  Holders of Series A
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive mandatory and cumulative dividends in an amount per annum equal to the dividend rate (described below) multiplied by the liquidation value, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, from the date of issuance,
whether or not declared. Dividends are payable in arrears in cash, except that, at the option of the Company, up to 50.0% of the dividends for any period may be paid through the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Payment
of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock is in preference and prior to any dividends payable on any class of the Companys common stock.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue at an annual rate as follows:   


 

 
 10.0% through March 15, 2012;   


 

 
 14.0% for the period commencing on March 16, 2012 and ending on September 15, 2013; 
 


 

 
 17.0% plus the increase in the 90-day LIBOR from September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2013 for the period commencing on September 16,
2013 and ending on September 15, 2015; and   


 

 
 20.0% plus the increase in the 90-day LIBOR from September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2015 for all periods commencing on or after
September 16, 2015, with an adjustment to the rate every two years thereafter.

The Company accrued $3.6 million in dividends, paid $0.5 million in
cash dividends and accreted $2.7 million on the Series A Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2011. The accretion of Series A Preferred Stock resulted in an equivalent reduction in additional paid-in capital on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011. The Company paid approximately $3.1 million in cash dividends in the first quarter of 2012, in accordance with the terms described above. 
In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Company whether voluntary or
involuntary, the holders of Series A preferred stock at the time shall be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount invested therein plus any accrued but
unpaid dividends, and dividend rights to the fullest extent permitted by law, before any distribution of assets is made to the holders of our common stock.  Additionally, upon receipt by the Company of net cash proceeds from (i) the issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of debt for borrowed money or (ii) the issuance by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries of equity, the Company shall redeem, for cash, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that number of shares of Series A preferred stock with an aggregate redemption price equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to
100% of such net cash proceeds and (2) the $125.0 million aggregate par value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus any accrued but unpaid dividends.  In conjunction with the CMP Acquisition, the Company assumed preferred stock of CMP with a fair value of $41.1 million as of August 1, 2011, which consisted of the par value of $32.7 million plus
cumulative undeclared dividends of $8.3 million as of the acquisition date. The Company recorded $0.5 million in dividends for the period from the date of the CMP Acquisition, August 1, 2011, to September 16, 2011. This preferred stock was
redeemed on September 16, 2011 for $41.6 million. 
11. Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
The Company uses the modified prospective method to account for compensation costs related to stock
options and restricted stock and uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant is affected by the Companys stock price,
historical stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. With respect to restricted stock awards, the Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period equal to the grant
date value of the shares awarded. To the extent non-vested restricted stock awards include performance or market conditions management examines the requisite service period to recognize the cost associated with the award on a case-by-case basis.
 Generally, the Companys grants of stock options that vest over four years and have a maximum
contractual term of ten years. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock by using a weighted average of historical stock price volatility over the expected term of the options. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate that it
uses in its option pricing model on United States Treasury issues with terms similar to the expected term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the class of stock subject to granted stock options in the
foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. The Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from estimates. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock-based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. 
On September 16, 2011, the Company issued stock options under the Cumulus Media Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan
(2011 Equity Incentive Plan) to certain of its officers for 17.7 million shares of Class A common stock with an aggregate grant date fair value of $23.4 million. The options have an exercise price of $4.34 per share, and
provide for vesting on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, with 30.0% of each award vesting on each of the first two anniversaries thereof, and 20.0% of each award vesting on each of the next two anniversaries thereof. The
fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: historical volatility of 77.3%, risk-free interest rate of approximately 0.9%, dividend yield of 0%, and an
expected term of 6.3 years. There were no grants of stock options in 2010 or 2009.  On September 16,
2011, in accordance with the terms of the Citadel Acquisition Agreement, each restricted stock award that was outstanding under Citadels 2010 Equity Incentive Plan immediately prior to the effective time of the Citadel Acquisition was deemed
to constitute, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the original award, an award of (i) cash consideration, (ii) stock consideration, or (iii) mixed consideration, as determined in accordance with the Citadel
Acquisition Agreement. This conversion resulted in the issuance of 0.9 million restricted shares of the Companys Class A common stock with an aggregate fair value of $2.2 million and payment of $17.6 million of cash
consideration, which the Company accounted for as a liability award (the 2011 Liability Award) in accordance with ASC 718, of which $5.4 million was recognized in conjunction with

the purchase price allocation for the portion of stock-based compensation expense related to the period prior to the Citadel Acquisition. The restricted shares will vest in full on the earliest
to occur of (i) June 3, 2012 (ii) upon a termination of the affected employee without cause by the Company, or (iii) for good reason by the affected employee, as defined under Citadels 2010 Equity Incentive Plan.
 The Company has issued restricted stock awards to members of the Board and certain key employees. Generally,
the restricted stock vests over a four-year period.  On May 12, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) granted 23,000 shares of time-vesting restricted Class A common stock, with an aggregate fair value on the date of grant of $0.1 million, or $4.43 per share, to the non-employee
directors of the Company.  On February 24, 2011, the Compensation Committee granted the Companys
chairman, president and chief executive officer (CEO), 160,000 shares of performance-vesting restricted Class A common stock and 160,000 shares of time-vesting restricted Class A common stock. The fair value on the date of
grant of both of these awards was $1.6 million, or $4.87 per share. Additionally, on February 24, 2011, 170,000 shares of time-vesting Class A common stock were granted to certain other officers of the Company, with an aggregate fair
value on the date of grant of $0.8 million, or $4.87 per share. Consistent with the terms of the awards, one-half of the shares granted with time-vesting conditions will vest after two years of continuous employment and one-fourth of the
restricted shares will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.  On
February 16, 2012, the Compensation Committee reviewed certain previously established performance criteria related to 800,000 outstanding shares of performance-vesting restricted stock granted to our CEO and determined that, in light of, among
other things, the significant transactions undertaken and successfully completed by the Company in 2011, including, but not limited to, the Citadel Acquisition and, CMP Acquisition and the Global Refinancing, such previously established performance
criteria were no longer applicable, and that it was appropriate to waive the remaining performance targets related to these awards, and such awards immediately vested. Approximately $1.1 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the
800,000 shares of performance-vesting restricted stock was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2011.  The
Compensation Committee granted 138,000 and 157,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock in 2010 and 2009, respectively, to certain officers and members of the Board. One-half of the shares granted will vest after two years of continuous
employment and one-fourth of the restricted shares will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The fair value at the date of grant of these awards was $0.5 million for the 2010 grant and $0.3 million for
the 2009 grant. Stock-based compensation expense for these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over each awards vesting period.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized approximately $5.8 million, $2.5 million and $2.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, respectively,
relating to grants of stock options and restricted shares, of which $1.6 million, $(0.3) million and $0.4 million, respectively, related to performance-vesting restricted shares. The associated tax benefits related to these non-cash stock-based
compensation awards for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $2.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, there was unrecognized compensation expense of approximately $25.0 million related to grants of restricted stock and stock options that is expected to be recognized over
a weighted average remaining life of 3.4 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized approximately $4.9 million in compensation expense related to the 2011 Liability Award, with an associated tax benefit of $1.9 million.
Unrecognized compensation costs for this award at December 31, 2011 were $7.1 million and are expected to be recognized over a remaining life of less than one year. 
As of December 31, 2011, the total number of shares of common stock that remain authorized, reserved and available
for issuance under any of the Companys equity incentive plans was approximately 16.4 million, not including shares underlying outstanding grants. The Company is only authorized to make additional award grants under the 2011 Equity
Incentive Plan.  The following tables summarize the Companys equity award activity for the year ended
December 31, 2011:

 Restricted common stock awards include 7,605 unvested warrants to purchase common stock. 
The total fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $5.6
million, of which $3.4 million was paid in cash. The total fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. 
2011 Equity Incentive Plan  The Board adopted the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan on July 8, 2011. Also, on July 8, 2011, stockholders owning a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company, upon the recommendation of
the Board, approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.  The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of
equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, performance units, and other awards for the purpose of providing
Cumulus Medias non-employee directors, consultants, officers and other employees incentives and rewards for superior performance.  The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. 
Total awards under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan are limited to 35,000,000 shares (the Authorized Plan
Aggregate) of Class A common stock. The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan also provides that: (i) the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock actually issued or transferred upon the exercise of incentive stock options
(ISOs) will not exceed 17,500,000 shares; (ii) the number 
  F-34

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   

of shares of Class A common stock issued as restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, performance units and other awards (after taking into account any forfeitures and cancellations) will
not, during the term of the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, in the aggregate exceed 12,000,000 shares of Class A common stock; (iii) no participant will be granted stock options or SARs, in the aggregate, for more than 11,500,000 shares of
Class A common stock during any calendar year; and no participant will be granted awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or other awards that are intended to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), in the aggregate, for more than 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock during any calendar year; and (iv) no participant during any calendar
year will be granted awards of performance units that are intended to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, in the aggregate, for more than a maximum value of $5,000,000 as of their
respective dates of grant.  The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan provides that only shares with respect to awards
that expire or are forfeited or cancelled, or shares that were covered by an award the benefit of which is paid in cash instead of shares, will again be available for issuance under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. The following shares will not be
added back to the Authorized Plan Aggregate: (i) shares tendered in payment of the option exercise price; (ii) shares withheld by the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligation; and (iii) shares that are repurchased by the
Company with stock option proceeds. Further, all shares covered by a SAR that is exercised and settled in shares, and whether or not all shares are actually issued to the participant upon exercise of the right, will be considered issued or
transferred pursuant to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.  The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan provides that
generally: (i) stock options and SARs may not become exercisable by the passage of time sooner than one-third per year over three years except in the event of retirement, death or disability of a participant or in the event of a change in
control (described below); (ii) stock options and SARs that become exercisable upon the achievement of Management Objectives (as defined below) cannot become exercisable sooner than one year from the date of grant except in the event of
retirement, death or disability of a participant or in the event of a change in control; (iii) restricted stock and RSUs may not become unrestricted by the passage of time sooner than one-third per year over three years unless restrictions
lapse sooner by virtue of retirement, death or disability of a participant or in the event of a change in control; (iv) the period of time within which Management Objectives relating to performance shares and performance units must be achieved
will be a minimum of one year, subject to earlier lapse or modification by virtue of retirement, death or disability of a participant or in the event of a change in control; (v) restricted stock and RSUs that vest upon the achievement of
Management Objectives cannot vest sooner than one year from the date of grant, but may be subject to earlier lapse or modification by virtue of retirement, death or disability of a participant or in the event of a change in control; and, as
described below, a limited number of awards, however, including restricted stock and RSUs granted to non-employee directors, may be granted without regard to the above minimum vesting periods. Repricing of options and SARs is prohibited without
stockholder approval under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.  In general, a change in control will be deemed to
have occurred if: (i) there is a consummation of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person or group; (ii) a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company is adopted; (iii) there is a consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation,
any purchase, sale, acquisition, disposition, merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person or group becomes the beneficial owner (excluding any options to purchase equity securities of the Company held by such person or group) of
more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company having the right to elect directors under ordinary circumstances; or (iv) a majority of the members of the Board are not Continuing Directors. For
purposes of this definition, a Continuing Director is, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board who (1) was a member of the Board on July 8, 2011 or (2) was nominated for election or elected to the Board
with the approval of either two-thirds of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board at the time of such nomination or election or two-thirds of those Company directors who were previously approved by Continuing Directors. 
The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan provides that dividends or other distributions on performance shares, restricted stock or
RSUs that are earned or that have restrictions that lapse as a result of the achievement of Management Objectives will be deferred until and paid contingent upon the achievement of the applicable Management Objectives. The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan
also provides that dividends and dividend equivalents will not be paid on stock options or SARs.  The 2011
Equity Incentive Plan provides that no stock options or SARs will be granted with an exercise or base price less than the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the date of grant. The 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is designed to allow
awards to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed by applying the Federal income and
estimated state tax rate in effect to the gross amounts of temporary differences and other tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry-forwards. In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers whether it is more
likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which these deductible temporary
differences reverse.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded deferred tax expense
of $16.7 million generated during the current year, resulting from amortization of broadcast licenses and goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes, but is not amortized in the financial statements. This charge was offset by a $76.7 million
deferred tax benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowance resulting from the CMP Acquisition and the Citadel Acquisition. Deferred tax liabilities other than those associated with indefinite lived intangible assets are considered a
source of future taxable income available to recover deferred tax assets. As such, the acquired deferred tax liabilities associated with the assets other than indefinite lived intangible assets allow for the Company to recognize a portion of
its pre acquisition deferred tax assets, resulting in a corresponding release of the valuation allowance into the income statement in 2011. Also during the year, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.5 million resulting from the
change in state tax rates and a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million from other miscellaneous adjustments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded
deferred tax expense of $3.6 million generated during the current year, resulting from amortization of broadcast licenses and goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes, but is not amortized in the financial statements. 
During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded deferred tax expense of $7.0 million resulting
from amortization of broadcast licenses and goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes, but is not amortized in the financial statements. This charge was offset by a $33.0 million deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of deferred
tax liabilities in connection with the impairment of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill and investment in affiliates. Also during the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded deferred tax expense of $3.2 million resulting from
the exchange of stations with Clear Channel.  At December 31, 2011, the Company has federal net operating
loss carry forwards available to offset future income of approximately $675.4 million which will expire in the years 2023 through 2031. A portion of these losses are subject to limitations due to ownership changes. 
At December 31, 2011, the Company has state net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future income of
approximately $624.7 million which will expire in the years 2012 through 2031. Of this amount, $191.8 million and $4.4 million were acquired in the Citadel Acquisition and the CMP Acquisition, respectively. A portion of these losses are subject to
limitations due to ownership changes.  In connection with the Citadel Acquisition, the Company acquired
federal net operating losses totaling approximately $247.0 million. Due to the change in control in Citadel, these net operating losses are subject to annual limitations on their usage will be between $50.0 and $92.0 million per year from 2012 to
2014. In addition, the Citadel Acquisition triggered a change in control for the Company that will result in the Companys net operating losses also being subject to annual limitations on their usage. The Company is currently evaluating the
extent of these annual limitations.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company continues to maintain a full
valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax
returns as well as future profitability. The Company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred
tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.  Applying
such standard as of December 31, 2011, the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized. In reaching this determination, the Company believes that its history of cumulative losses over the
past three calendar years outweighs other positive evidence that it is more likely than not that the Companys deferred tax assets will be recognized. Should the Companys experience of earning pre-tax book income over the past two
calendar years continue into the future, the Company may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance during 2012. The amount of the valuation allowance released would be reflected in earnings at such time. 
The Company continues to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in current income tax
expense. The total interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2011 was $1.1 million. The total unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2011 was $13.5 million. Of this total, $12.2 million
represents the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. Approximately $13.3 million relates to items which are not expected to change
significantly within the next 12 months. Substantially all federal, state, local and foreign income tax years have been closed for the tax years through 2007; however, the various tax jurisdictions may adjust the Companys net operating loss
carry forwards.  Additionally, during the year, the Company established unrecognized tax benefit liabilities
related to the Citadel Acquisition and the CMP Acquisition. The following table reconciles unrecognized tax benefits during the year:

13. Earnings per Share 
For all periods presented, the Company has disclosed basic and diluted earnings per common share
utilizing the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company allocates
undistributed net income after any allocations for preferred stock dividends between each class of common stock on an equal basis as the Third Amended and Restated Charter provides that the holders of each class of common stock have equal rights and
privileges, except with respect to voting on certain matters.  Non-vested restricted shares of Class A
common stock and the Company Warrants are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating basic weighted average common shares outstanding in periods in which the Company records net income. Diluted earnings per share is computed in
the same manner as basic earnings per share after assuming issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent shares, which includes stock options and certain warrants to purchase common stock. Antidilutive instruments are not
considered in this calculation. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security may share in earnings, as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed.
Earnings are allocated to each participating security and common share equally, after deducting dividends declared or accreted on preferred stock. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands).

14. Leases 
The Company has non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for land, tower space, office-space,
certain office equipment and vehicles. The operating leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to ten years and require the Company to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Rental expense for
operating leases was approximately $28.4 million, $9.8 million, and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of
one year) as of December 31, 2011 are as follows (in thousands):

15. Commitments and Contingencies 
Future Commitments 
Effective December 31, 2009, the Companys radio music license agreements with the two largest performance
rights organizations, The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), expired. Radio Music License Committee (RMLC), which negotiates music licensing fees for
most of the radio industry with ASCAP and BMI, had reached an agreement with these organizations on a temporary fee schedule that reflects a provisional discount of 7.0% against 2009 fee levels. The temporary fee reductions became effective in
January 2010. Absent an agreement on longer-term fees between the RMLC and ASCAP and BMI, the U.S. District Court in New York has the authority to make an interim and permanent fee ruling for the new contract period. In May 2010 and
June 2010, the U.S. District Courts judges charged with determining the license fees ruled to further reduce interim fees paid to ASCAP and BMI, respectively, down approximately another 11.0% from the previous temporary fees negotiated
with the RMLC. On January 27, 2012, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a settlement between the RMLC and ASCAP concerning the fees payable covering the period January 1, 2010 through December 31,
2016. Included in the agreement are a $75.0 million industry fee credit against 2010-2011 payments to be credited in equal annual installments over 2012-2016, a return to a gross revenue fee structure with standard deductions for terrestrial/analog,
HD multicasting broadcasts and new media uses and expanded rights coverage to accommodate the industrys developing new media platforms related to websites, smart phones and other wireless devices. 
The radio broadcast industrys principal ratings service is Arbitron, which publishes surveys for domestic radio
markets. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have agreements with Arbitron under which they receive programming ratings materials in a majority of their respective markets. The remaining aggregate obligation under the agreements with Arbitron
was $84.3 million as of December 31, 2011 and is expected to be paid in accordance with the agreements through June 2016.  The Company has engaged Katz Media Group, Inc. (Katz) as its national advertising sales agent. The Companys contract with Katz contains termination provisions that, if exercised by the
Company during the term of the contract, would obligate the Company to pay a termination fee to Katz, calculated based upon a formula set forth in the contract.  Legal Proceedings  In August 2005, the Company
and certain other radio broadcasting companies were subpoenaed by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York in connection with the New York Attorney Generals investigation of promotional practices related to record
companies dealings with radio stations broadcasting in New York. The Company is cooperating with the Attorney General in this investigation. It is not possible to reasonably estimate what the Companys loss exposure, if any, could be
related to this investigation, but the Company does not currently anticipate that any exposure would materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
On December 11, 2008, Qantum Communications (Qantum) filed a counterclaim in a foreclosure action the
Company initiated in the Okaloosa County, Florida Circuit Court. The Companys action was designed to collect a debt owed to the Company by Star Broadcasting, Inc. (Star), which then owned radio station WTKE-FM in Holt, Florida. In
its counterclaim, Qantum alleged that the Company tortiously interfered with Qantums contract to acquire radio station WTKE from Star by entering into an agreement to buy WTKE after Star had represented to the Company that its contract with
Qantum had been terminated (and that Star was therefore free to enter into the new agreement with the Company). On February 27, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Star. In connection with the settlement regarding the
since-terminated attempt to purchase WTKE, the Company recorded $7.8 million in costs associated with the terminated transaction in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, that were paid in 2011.
 On January 21, 2010, a former employee of CMP Susquehanna Corp. (CMPSC) (which became a
subsidiary of Cumulus upon completion of the CMP Acquisition on August 1, 2011) filed a purported class action lawsuit, pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division (the
Court), against CMPSC claiming (i) unlawful failure to pay required overtime wages; (ii) late pay and waiting time penalties; (iii) failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements; (iv) failure to indemnify for
necessary expenses and losses; and (v) unfair trade practices under Californias Unfair Competition Act.  On September 2, 2011, CMPSC and this former employee entered into a Joint Stipulation re: Settlement and Release of Class Action Claims (the Settlement) with respect to such lawsuit. The
Settlement was preliminarily approved by the Court on February 6, 2012 and provides for the payment by CMPSC of a maximum of $0.9 million in full and final settlement of all of the claims made in the lawsuit.

CUMULUS MEDIA INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Continued)   
In March 2011, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries were
named as defendants along with other radio companies, including Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., CBS Radio, Inc., Entercom Communications, Greater Media, Inc. and Townsquare Media, LLC in a patent infringement suit. The case, Mission Abstract Data
L.L.C., d/b/a Digimedia v. Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., et. al., Civil Action Case No: 1:99-mc-09999, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (filed March 1, 2011), alleges that the defendants are infringing or have infringed
plaintiffs patents entitled Selection and Retrieval of Music from a Digital Database. Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The Company is vigorously defending this lawsuit and is not yet able to determine
what effect the lawsuit will have, if any, on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
The Company is currently, and expects that from time to time in the future it will be, party to, or a defendant in,
various claims or lawsuits that are generally incidental to its business. The Company expects that it will vigorously contest any such claims or lawsuits and believes that the ultimate resolution of any known claim or lawsuit will not have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
16. Restricted Cash 
As of December 31, 2011, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included approximately
$3.8 million in restricted cash, of which $2.2 million relates to a cash reserve from the Citadel Acquisition. The reserve will be used to satisfy the remaining allowed, disputed or unreconciled unsecured claims related to Citadels prior
bankruptcy proceedings. $1.6 million of the restricted cash balance relates to securing the maximum exposure generated by automated clearing house transactions in the Companys operating bank accounts and is dictated by the Companys
banks internal policies with respect to cash. 
17. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)

18. Supplemental Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
At December 31, 2011 Cumulus and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the
Subsidiary Guarantors) provided guarantees of the obligations of Cumulus Holdings under the 7.75% Senior Notes. These guarantees are full and unconditional (subject to customary release provisions) as well as joint and several. Certain
of the Subsidiary Guarantors may be subject to restrictions on their respective ability to distribute earnings to Cumulus Holdings or the Parent Guarantor. Not all of the subsidiaries of Cumulus and Cumulus Holdings guarantee the 7.75% Senior Notes
(such non-guaranteeing subsidiaries, collectively, the Subsidiary Non-guarantors).
