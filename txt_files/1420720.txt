PART I
Item 1. Business
iBio, Inc. (iBio and the Company) is a biotechnology company
focused on commercializing its proprietary technologies, the iBioLaunch
platform for vaccines and therapeutic proteins, as well as the iBioModulator
platform for vaccine enhancement. Our strategy is to promote our technology,
through commercial product collaborations and license arrangements. We expect
to share in the increased value of our technology through upfront license fees,
milestone revenues, service revenues, and royalties on end products. We believe
our technology offers the opportunity to develop products that might not
otherwise be commercially feasible, and to work with both corporate and
government clients to reduce their costs during product development and meet
their needs for low cost, high quality biologics manufacturing systems and
vaccines with improved properties. Our near-term focus is to establish business
arrangements for use of our technology by licensees for the development and
production of products for both therapeutic and vaccine uses. 
Vaccine candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary platform
are applicable to newly emerging strains of H1N1 swine-like influenza, H5N1
avian influenza, yellow fever, and anthrax. 
Therapeutic candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary
platform include human alpha-galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry disease,
a modified version of human C-1 esterase inhibitor for the treatment of
hereditary angioedema and other diseases, human alpha-1 antitrypsin for
treatment of disorders caused by a lack or deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin,
and several other therapeutic protein targets including antibodies, for which
preliminary product feasibility has been demonstrated. 
In order to attract appropriate licensees and increase the value of our
share of such intended contractual arrangements, we engaged the Center for Molecular
Biotechnology of Fraunhofer USA, Inc. (FhCMB) in 2003 to perform research and
development activities to develop the iBioLaunch platform and to create our
first product candidate. We selected a plant-based influenza vaccine for human
use as the product candidate to exemplify the value of the platform. Based on
research conducted by FhCMB, our proprietary technology is applicable to the
production of vaccines for any strain of influenza including strains of H1N1
swine-like influenza. A Phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H1N1
influenza, based on iBios technology, was initiated in September 2010. We
announced positive interim results in June 2011 and successfully completed the
clinical trial in March 2012. The vaccine candidate demonstrated strong
induction of dose correlated immune responses, with or without adjuvant, as
assessed by virus microneutralization antibody assays and hemagglutination
inhibition (HAI) responses. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all
doses when administered with and without adjuvant.

In connection with the research and development
    agreement, FhCMB agreed to use its best efforts to obtain grants from governmental
    and non-governmental entities to fund additional development of our proprietary
    plant-based technology. Consequently, in addition to the funding we have
    provided through agreements to FhCMB, FhCMB has received funding from the
    Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation for development of various vaccines based upon our proprietary
technology including an experimental vaccine for H5N1 avian influenza. A Phase
1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H5N1 influenza, based on iBios
technology, was initiated in December 2010. We announced positive interim
results in June 2011 and successfully completed the clinical trial in March
2012.
In addition to the platform and product development engagements, in
2006, the Company engaged FhCMB to create a prototype production module for
products made through the use of the platform. The purpose of this engagement was
to demonstrate the ease and economy with which platform-based products could be
manufactured in order to attract potential licensees and increase the value of
our share of such business arrangements. The prototype design, which
encompasses the entire production process from seeding through pre-infiltration
plant growth, infiltration with agrobacteria, harvesting of plant tissue and
purification of target proteins, was completed in May 2008. A pilot plant based
upon this prototype was subsequently constructed in the FhCMB facility in
Newark, Delaware. This pilot plant, and the equipment in it, are owned by FhCMB
and have been validated for current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
production. It is expected to be used for cGMP production of protein targets
for clinical trials of product candidates utilizing our platform technology.
In January 2011, we announced the grant of a commercial,
royalty-bearing license to Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos (Fiocruz) of Brazil
to develop, manufacture and sell certain vaccines based upon our proprietary
technology. Fiocruz will invest $6.5 million to bring the first product
candidate, a yellow fever vaccine, through a Phase I clinical trial. The World
Health Organization has estimated that 200,000 unvaccinated people contract
yellow fever each year, and approximately 30,000 die from the disease. 
Development of the yellow fever vaccine candidate will be performed
through a commercial collaboration among the Company, Fiocruz and FhCMB. The
license covers the nations of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. The
Company retains the right to sell the products developed under the license and
collaboration agreement in any other territory with a royalty back to Fiocruz.
Bio-Manguinhos is a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a central agency of
the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos produces and develops
immunobiological items to respond to public health demands. Its product line
consists of vaccines, reagents and biopharmaceuticals. Fiocruz is a leading company
in the national export of human vaccines and a major participant in total
export sales of the Brazilian pharmaceutical sector. Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos is
one of the main producers of vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases
in Latin America. Fiocruz is a certified World Health Organization provider to
United Nations agencies, and is a leading world manufacturer of yellow fever
vaccine, which it has exported to over 60 countries. 
In February, May and June 2012, we announced the issuance or allowance
of U.S. patents for, and scientific progress with potential product
applications of our iBioModulator platform, also referred to as our lichenase
fusion-protein technology.
The Company established non-commercial arrangements among the Company,
certain government entities, a non-governmental organization (which we refer to
herein as a NGO) and FhCMB, pursuant to which the Company grants
non-commercial rights to use its platform for the development and production by
FhCMB of product candidates selected by the government entities and NGO, in
consideration for grants by the government entities and NGO directly to FhCMB
to fund such research and development. 
Through (i) the Company/FhCMB contracts and (ii)
    the non-commercial arrangements described above (which we refer to collectively
    as the business
structure), the Company retains ownership of the intellectual property
and exclusive worldwide commercial rights in the fields of human health and
veterinary influenza applications of the intellectual property. The Company
licenses or otherwise grants use rights (a) to government and NGO entities for
not-for-profit applications of the intellectual property for the development
or application for which they granted or were granted funding, and (b) to FhCMB
for research purposes and applications in other fields. At this time, the
Company is not pursuing development in the area of veterinary influenza. See
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
in connection with the Companys impairment charge of $87,000 and $586,000
taken during the fourth quarter for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
This business structure helps the Company to enhance
    the value of commercial rights and the scope of applications of its platform
    technology. It also helps the Company demonstrate the validity and apparent
    value of the platform to parties to whom it will offer licenses or other
    business opportunities. Outsourcing our research and development work allows
    us to develop our product candidates, and thereby promote the value of our
    platform for licensing and product development purposes, without bearing
    the full risk and expense of establishing and maintaining our own research
    and development staff and facilities. FhCMB is engaged to perform research
    and development for the yellow fever vaccine project based on its expertise.
    The contract with FhCMB is expected to be $6.5 million. Service revenues
    and research expense under this arrangement commenced in January 2011. The
    amount of revenues recorded under this agreement and related research and
    development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately
    $1,277,000 and $520,000, respectively. The Company invoices this only customer
    in US dollars and also receives collection of the outstanding receivable
    in US dollars. Therefore, there are no foreign currency exchange translation
    gains or losses involved with this customer. 
In July 2012 we announced a global alliance with GE Healthcare (GEHC)
to commercialize our plant-based technologies for the manufacture of
biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. The alliance is intended to build on the
existing development and marketing agreement between the two companies
announced in 2010 and to combine iBios proprietary iBioLaunch platform with GE
Healthcares capabilities in start-to-finish technologies for biopharmaceutical
manufacturing. Under the terms of the agreement, 
- 5 -


iBio will be the preferred provider
    of vaccine or therapeutic product manufacturing technology incorporating
    a plant based protein expression system, while GEHC will be the preferred
    provider of engineering services and bioprocess solutions, to any customers
    that may be interested in a bio-manufacturing facility incorporating a plant-based
    expression system. The agreement further specifies allocation of responsibilities
    for product development, process scale-up, facilities design and development,
    and technology transfer among iBio, FhCMB, and GEHC. The Agreement also sets
    forth the terms of a non-exclusive license to iBios
    technology that iBio has agreed to offer to any customer referred by GEHC
    pursuant to the Agreement.
The Companys platform technology is sometimes referred to as iBioLaunch
technology or the iBioLaunch platform, and the category of this technology
is sometimes referred to as plant-based technology or as a plant-based
platform.
The Company has exclusive control over, and the rights to ownership of,
the intellectual property related to all human health and veterinary influenza
applications of the plant-based technology developed by FhCMB. Current
development projects include conducting proof-of-principle preclinical studies
and conducting clinical studies of proprietary influenza vaccines.
Many biotech drugs have been on the market long
    enough for patents on them to expire. Emerging opportunities for biosimilars
    (also known as biogenerics or follow-on biologics) create potential for our
    platform technology to be used by potential licensees to enter the market
    utilizing what the Company expects to be an economical production system.
    The Company is seeking commercial partners for this category of products
    and is unlikely to develop products in this category without the financial
    and marketing support of a commercial partner.
Historically, in addition to the development of the platform technology
described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company has also generated sales of
nutritional supplements utilizing plants as sources of high-quality nutritional
minerals. The Company has a patented process for hydroponic growth of edible
plants that causes them to accumulate high levels of important nutritional
minerals such as chromium, selenium, iron and zinc. The Company utilized the
services of various wholly owned subsidiaries of our Former Parent company,
Integrated BioPharma, Inc. (Integrated BioPharma or Former Parent) to
support the production, marketing and sales of these phytomineral products.
Effective in April 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with IHT
Health Products, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Parent, (IHT)
wherein it granted an exclusive license to the Companys patented process in
consideration for a royalty of five percent (5%) of net sales and the
obligation of IHT to maintain in force and good standing the Companys patent
and related intellectual property. At the same time, rights under the existing
customer agreements were beneficially transferred to IHT. iBio receives royalty
income from the exclusive license to IHT.
In November 2007, the Board of Directors of our Former Parent approved
a plan to distribute its equity interests in the Company to its stockholders in
the form of a dividend. The record date of the dividend was August 12, 2008
with a distribution date of August 18, 2008. The stockholders of our Former
Parent received one share of the Companys common stock for each share of
common stock they owned of the Former Parent as of the record date. Immediately
following the spin-off, the Company became a public company with stock traded
on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol IBPM. The Companys stock was listed
for trading on the NYSE MKT in January 2011.
Our Business Structure
A key element of our business strategy is to establish business
arrangements with licensees to use our platform technology for manufacturing
vaccines and therapeutic proteins or for development and commercialization of
our product candidates. Thus, we may enter into agreements with other parties
to provide them with commercial rights to either our product candidates or with
commercial rights to our platform technology itself for manufacturing of their
own products. 
We believe we can achieve our corporate objectives without employing a
large staff, and anticipate maintaining our thinly staffed employment structure
with modest increases in staff as required to develop and support new business
relationships. As described above, FhCMB and the Company are currently working
within our business structure to develop product candidates based upon our
plant-based platform technology pursuant to an agreement that continues until
December 2014.
We have been relying upon FhCMB for support in advancing certain drug
candidates and intend to rely on FhCMB and other collaborators for additional
work during further development and testing of our product candidates. With
FhCMB we have been pursuing and obtaining non-dilutive government and
non-governmental organization funding directed through FhCMB to provide supplemental
funding for applications of our technology. To
date, FhCMB has been awarded a total of approximately $33 million in grants
from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for development of product
candidates based on the iBioLaunch platform and for research and development of
vaccines against influenza, malaria and African sleeping sickness
(trypanosomiasis).
To facilitate the grant and continuing support, we agreed to make our
platform technology available to various programs to complete development and
provide Global Access to vaccines against influenza, rabies virus, malaria
and trypanosomiasis, provided that if the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
and FhCMB do not pursue such programs to completion, the subject rights revert
to us. The term 
- 6 -


Global Access means access for people most in need within the
developing world in low income and lower-middle-income countries, as identified
by the World Bank. Because we have exclusive commercial rights to the
technology and these products for human health applications, this grant and any
further similar grants would benefit us by enabling FhCMB to enhance the
platform technology and expand the information about the technical performance
of product candidates derived from our technology. We may decide to
commercially license such technology to collaborators for advancement into
human clinical evaluation and eventual commercial development. 
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
    has also provided funding to FhCMB for advanced development of our technology
    platform and for preclinical and clinical studies for an anthrax-plague combination
    vaccine and for an H1N1 influenza vaccine project. Through June 30, 2012,
    FhCMB has received funding and funding commitments for these projects totaling
    approximately $34 million. This funding is similarly beneficial to us because
    we have retained the commercial rights to any technology improvements resulting
from those projects.
In summary, the advancement of our technology has indirectly benefited
from the funding and funding commitments of research and development activities
at FhCMB in recent years by U.S. government and non-governmental organizations
in amounts aggregating approximately $67 million.
Pursuant to the Technology Transfer Agreement (TTA) between our
company and FhCMB, effective in January 2004, we paid $3.6 million to FhCMB to
acquire the exclusive rights in intellectual property owned by FhCMB and to
obtain from FhCMB maintenance and support necessary to protect the intellectual
property through the preparation and filing of patent applications in the
United States and around the world. We currently hold eight U.S. patents and
three international patents. Additionally, we have fifteen U.S. and
thirty-eight international patent applications pending. The latter includes
numerous foreign countries including Australia, Brazil Canada, China, Hong
Kong, India, Japan, New Zealand, and several countries in Europe. We continue
to prepare patent applications relating to our expanding technology in the U.S.
and abroad.
Our intellectual property comprises the technology platform pursuant to
which hydroponically grown green plants can be used for the accelerated
development and manufacture of high-value proteins of interest as candidate
therapeutic products and vaccines applicable to a broad range of disease
agents. These include human alpha-galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry
disease, a modified human C-1 esterase inhibitor for the treatment of
hereditary angioedema and other diseases, human alpha-1 antitrypsin for
treatment of disorders caused by a lack or deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin;
and vaccines for influenza, sleeping sickness, anthrax, plague, and HPV. 
By certain subsequent agreements, we engaged FhCMB to perform certain
research activities for which we made payments when certain milestone tasks
were performed; such payments were conditioned only on the performance of the
task, not upon the success or value of what was determined or discovered.
At various times since January 2004, we have amended our agreements
with FhCMB. These amendments include a commitment by FhCMB to further develop
exclusively for and transfer to us rights to proprietary technology and
intellectual property rights in the fields defined in the agreements comprising
principally plant-based human vaccines, human antibodies, and human therapeutic
proteins and veterinary applications of plant-based influenza vaccines. For
these activities, we have committed to make non-refundable payments to FhCMB of $2
million per year for five years, aggregating to $10 million, since November
2009. FhCMB was required to expend an additional amount at least equal to the
amounts paid by us for the same purposes. 
In addition, we are required to make royalty payments to FhCMB equal to
1% of all receipts derived by us from sales of products utilizing the
proprietary technology and 15% of all receipts derived by us from licensing the
propriety technology to third parties for a period of fifteen years. Minimum
annual aggregate payments of $200,000 are required under the agreement beginning
in 2011. In turn, FhCMB is required to pay us royalty payments equal to 9% of
all receipts, if any, realized by FhCMB from sales, licensing or
commercialization of the intellectual property licensed from us.
We participated with FhCMB from May 2007 through June 2009 on a
contract from Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA) of the United States
Department of Defense for an $8.5 million project to further enhance our
plant-based technology platform for accelerated manufacture of vaccines and
antibodies. We served as a sub-contractor to FhCMB and derived revenues of
approximately $1,035,000 during that period. The contract facilitated
construction of a pilot manufacturing plant using our platform technology with
capacity to provide sufficient materials for clinical trials.
Our Product Candidates
We continue to demonstrate applicability and commercial value of our
platform technology and our pipeline of vaccine and therapeutic products
developed with the platform. 
We believe we have demonstrated the applicability
    of our platform technology to vaccines for influenza. In addition, in collaboration
    with FhCMB, we are also developing product candidates for the biodefense
    market, for infectious diseases important in the developing world such as
    human papilloma virus, and therapeutic protein candidates that address a
    variety of global markets.

Seasonal and H1N1 Influenza Vaccines. We
believe our technology is applicable to target vaccines directed against
seasonal influenza virus strains. Our vaccine candidates have shown significant
promise in preclinical efficacy studies in ferrets (the preferred animal model
for testing influenza products). In an evaluation of three vaccine candidate
formulations in groups of eight ferrets each along with both positive and negative
controls, no adverse events were seen in any animals receiving our vaccine
candidates. Only one animal receiving one of our vaccine candidates showed any
measurable virus shedding, which is an important measure of vaccine
effectiveness. These results were as good as the results obtained with positive
control animals. The immune responses and protective immunity induced by our
vaccine candidates in these animal tests are equivalent to results expected
from this type of test to indicate the probability of effectiveness in human
subjects. More detail on these tests is available in the scientific paper
published in 2008 in the journal Influenza
and Other Respiratory Viruses, Volume 2, pages 33-40. 
A Phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H1N1 influenza,
based on iBios technology, was initiated in September 2010. We announced
positive interim results in June 2011 and successful completion of the clinical
trial in March 2012. The vaccine candidate demonstrated strong induction of
dose correlated immune responses, with or without adjuvant, as assessed by
virus icroneutralization antibody assays and hemagglutination inhibition
(HAI) responses. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses when
administered with and without adjuvant.
We believe our technology is applicable to any influenza strains, and
we expect to modify our product development plans to incorporate appropriate
antigens into any new vaccine formulation we advance to clinical testing. We
currently have no specific plans to advance such a product into clinical
testing.
Unlike the most common method of producing vaccines against influenza,
our process does not rely on chicken eggs and does not require work with whole
influenza viruses. Rather, we produce subunit vaccines that are composed of
only parts of the protein components of the disease-causing viruses. We believe
our subunit vaccines are promising for prevention of influenza infection in
humans because they have been demonstrated to prevent influenza infections in
ferrets, the experimental model of choice for evaluating human influenza
vaccines.
Pandemic Avian Influenza Vaccine. Through
FhCMB and their funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we are
developing vaccine candidates targeting highly pathogenic avian influenza
(H5N1) viruses based upon the iBioLaunch Platform. These candidates have
demonstrated immunogenicity and have been successfully tested in mice and
ferrets for protective efficacy. Like our candidate vaccines for seasonal
influenza, our candidate vaccines for avian influenza are subunit vaccines.
Thus, we do not need to culture the intact avian influenza virus in order to
produce our candidate vaccines. 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed significant
funding to FhCMB for preclinical development and a Phase 1 human clinical trial
of this pandemic influenza vaccine candidate using our technology. A Phase 1
human clinical trial of an iBioLaunch-produced H5N1 influenza vaccine candidate
has been successfully completed and peer-reviewed results are expected to be
published in a scientific journal during 2012. Our longer-term goal, subject to
commercial partnering arrangements, is to develop a combined vaccine effective
for preventing both seasonal and pandemic influenza infections.
Therapeutic Vaccine for Human Papilloma Virus.
We have commercial rights to vaccine candidates developed pursuant to our
business structure based on fusing a protein component of Human Papilloma Virus
(HPV) called the E7 antigen, to the LicKM protein that is modified from a
protein of the bacterium Clostridium
thermocellum. Several of these candidate vaccine formulations have
demonstrated sufficient immune stimulation and protection from disease in mouse
experiments to justify further investment in its development as a potential
human therapeutic product. In experimental tests in mice, with each formulation
administered to ten mice, some candidates protected all of the mice from the
growth of tumors caused by the HPV virus. Additional detail on these experiments
was published in 2007 and 2009 in the scientific journal Vaccine, 2007; 25(16):3018-3021 and 2009;
27(25-26):3395-3397. 
Biodefense Products. We have commercial rights
to an oral anthrax booster vaccine candidate developed by FhCMB in
collaboration with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). Animal tests
have demonstrated safety and efficacy of this product candidate. We also have
commercial rights to candidate plague vaccines that FhCMB has demonstrated to
be effective in non-human primate tests in which four groups of two monkeys
each were inoculated and then challenged with plague infection. Detailed
results of these experiments were published in 2007 in the scientific journal Vaccine, 2007 Apr 20; 25(16):3014-7.
DoD has also provided funding to FhCMB for advanced
    development of the technology platform and for preclinical and clinical studies
    for an anthrax-plague combination vaccine and for an H1N1 influenza vaccine
    project. Through June 30, 2012 FhCMB has received funding and funding commitments
    for these projects totaling approximately $34 million. This funding is similarly
    beneficial to us because we have the commercial rights to any technology
    improvements resulting from those projects.
Vaccines for Developing Markets. Funding for
developing-world products comes primarily from FhCMBs collaborators,
especially the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and supplements the
research and development payments that we make to FhCMB to advance and expand
the technology to which we have exclusive commercial rights. This supplemental
funding provides significant benefits in technology optimization and is
synergistic with our product development programs. Through these developing
world programs positive preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy results have
been obtained for vaccines for HPV, trypanosomiasis and malaria. Results of
preclinical testing of an iBioLaunch-produced malaria vaccine candidate were
published in 2011 in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (August
2011, pages 13511357).

Therapeutic Protein Product Candidates. We
have tested the feasibility of developing and producing certain therapeutic
proteins using our technology including the following: Human
alpha-galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry disease, a modified human C-1
esterase inhibitor for the treatment of hereditary angioedema and other
diseases, and Human alpha-1 antitrypsin for treatment of disorders caused by a
lack or deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin. 
Target Markets
Based on scientific data produced by FhCMB, we believe that our
platform technology is well suited for application to both vaccines and
therapeutic proteins. Information on product markets of interest to us is
provided in the following paragraphs. 
Previously, our business focus was primarily on
    establishing the necessary capability, information, and data to support commercial
licensing of our platform technology for broad protein manufacturing purposes
as well as for specific vaccine and therapeutic product candidates. We have long
believed that the potential advantages of our technology will enable us to
compete effectively against other providers of technology for biotechnology
product manufacturing that may be slower, more capital intensive, or more
costly to operate. We have initiated a business development program focused on
this opportunity as our intellectual property includes proprietary product
candidates that may enhance our ability to participate profitably in certain
markets.
Vaccine Market. We believe our opportunities to
establish new commercial collaborations in vaccine markets will arise in two
categories: a) companies interested in traditional vaccine products well
established in clinical practice; and b) governments around the world
increasingly committed to achieving autonomy in manufacturing vaccines to
protect their citizens from natural outbreaks or deliberate infection. We
believe our platform, due to its product flexibility and projected advantages
in cost and time of implementation over traditional processes, will be an
attractive option for both commercial and government collaborators. The first
disease category in which we have focused on demonstrating the applicability of
our technology for vaccines is influenza.
Influenza Market. We believe that an attractive
business opportunity for us is to establish one or more commercial
collaborations for the use of our iBioLaunch platform technology in the
development of vaccines for prevention of influenza infections and to establish
validated technology for rapid response to the outbreak of new strains of
influenza. We have demonstrated the efficiencies of our iBioLaunch technology
at a laboratory level by producing candidate influenza vaccines in weeks versus
the months required for commercially used chicken egg methods. The yields we
have obtained in these laboratory experiments are high enough to be competitive
with other methods if we can achieve the same yields and the same time
efficiencies on a commercial scale. We have also demonstrated the safety and
immunogenicity of our iBioLaunch-produced influenza vaccine candidate in a
Phase 1 human clinical trial. We, however, have not yet tested our technology
at the scale that will be required for commercial use nor at a scale sufficient
to conclude what our commercial cost of goods will be.
Biodefense Vaccine Market. In collaboration
with FhCMB and future commercial partners, we expect to participate in the
introduction of important new prevention and treatment products as potential
countermeasures against bioterrorism threats and for use in the developing
world. We do not currently have any commercial partners.
Markets for Therapeutic Proteins. Our
technology is broadly applicable to the production of proteins ranging in size
and complexity from monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins such as
interferons, growth factors, and enzymes. The potential market for application
of our platform to therapeutic proteins is large and can be divided into three
types of opportunities: a) proteins for treatment of orphan diseases; and b)
proteins for bio-similar (bio-generic) products; and c) proteins for novel
proprietary products developed by our products. 
Treatment of Orphan Diseases. The worldwide
market for orphan disease therapy is estimated to be over $80 billion and
approximately half of that is addressed through biologic rather than chemical
drugs. Well-known products in this category include human enzymes for treatment
of lysosomal storage diseases, such as Fabry disease, and products for
treatment of less-common types of cancer. The incentives for companies to
invest in new treatments for smaller patient populations are substantial, both
due to tax incentives and also due to the profit margins that are typically
seen for these products. To date, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
has granted more than 2,000 orphan designations to products in various stages
of development. We expect to attract some commercial interest in our platform
for manufacturing certain orphan biologic drugs from companies that have not
yet committed to the more expensive traditional bioreactor alternatives. There
can be no assurance of how long it will take before a pharmaceutical or
biotechnology company will approach us for commercial interest. 
Bio-similar Products. The potential market for
bio-similar products is large and growing according to industry analysts.
Approximately $80 billion in biologics sales has been estimated by analysts to
be susceptible to biosimilar competition by 2013. Due to the efficiency of our
platform, we believe we will be able to establish commercial collaborations to
participate in this growing market segment.
Research and Development
Our iBioLaunch technology is a platform that uses green plants for the
accelerated development and manufacture of high value proteins of immediate
interest as product candidates. In addition to therapeutics, we believe that
our technology is applicable to vaccines for a broad range of disease agents,
based on laboratory experiments conducted to date. We believe we can target
rapidly
- 9 -


evolving disease agents and develop product candidates that will
demonstrate high safety, potency and efficacy. We believe that we will be able
to license our iBioLaunch technology to corporations and governments for
commercial application to pharmaceutical proteins and vaccines.
The iBioLaunch technology is used in a series of steps. First, normal
green plants are grown for a few weeks, and at the same time, genes of interest
are inserted into proprietary target DNA plasmids. A plasmid is a DNA molecule,
usually circular, that can replicate inside a cell, such as a bacterial cell.
These plasmids include sequences derived from plant viruses to enable easier
activation of genes of interest inside living green plant tissue and also
sequences derived from the bacterium, Agrobacterium
tumefaciens, to enable efficient transfer of the entire vehicle into
green plant tissue and activation of the genes once inside. Secondly, once both
the plants and the plasmids with the new gene or genes of interest are ready,
we transfer the engineered plasmids into plants by first putting them into
Agrobacteria and then infusing the living Agrobacteria into growing green
plants where the protein encoded by the new gene can be produced. After the
transfer of bacteria into plants, the plants are grown for approximately an
additional week and then the plant tissue is harvested and the desired protein
or vaccine molecules are extracted and purified.
Because this entire process uses commonly available materials, we are
not dependent on unique sources of raw material, nor are we limited to
purchasing from single suppliers. The process is fast enough and inexpensive
enough to enable more experiments to be conducted in a given period of time
than can usually be conducted with slower or more expensive technology such as
cultured animal cells and bioreactor methods. A more technically detailed
description of this technology and its use was published in 2007 in the
scientific journal Influenza and Other
Respiratory Viruses, volume 1, pages 19-25. Note that in this
publication, the term iBioLaunch is not used to describe the technology because
that commercial designation was created after the publication of these
scientific data.
Because our iBioLaunch technology has proven useful at a laboratory level
in the production of high value proteins of immediate interest as product
candidates, we believe it can be applied to commercial product development and
biologic pharmaceutical manufacturing. Advantages of our platform technology
include its short development time frame for the harvesting of the applicable
protein or vaccine molecules and applicability to a broad range of
pharmaceutical proteins.
The table below summarizes the results of tests conducted to date to
assess the breadth of applicability of our iBioLaunch platform technology.
Some, but not all, of the listed targets are currently being pursued as product
candidates by us to document the effectiveness of our platform technology.
However, this table is presented to illustrate the breadth of applicability of
our technology, rather than as a list of products under active development.

Our iBioModulator technology is based on a modified form of the
cellulose degrading enzyme lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic
and anaerobic bacterium. Previous work with lichenase (LicKM) has shown that it
is easily expressed in plants using the iBioLaunch expression platform, and
that it is a useful carrier molecule for vaccine antigens (either complete
proteins or peptide antigens). The modified lichenase molecule can accept up to
three vaccine antigens for presentation to the immune system, and has
previously been used to make vaccine candidates for plague, HPV, malaria,
yellow fever, and influenza.
Vaccines for HPV and malaria created as lichenase fusions have been
shown to have improved effectiveness over vaccines made by unfused HPV or
malaria proteins. In the case of HPV-lichenase fusions, greater protection from
HPV tumors were observed in mice and mice bearing HPV tumors showed
substantially improved survival when vaccinated with HPV-lichenase fusions when
compared to unfused vaccines. Malaria-lichenase antigen fusions showed higher
levels of induced malaria-specific antibodies and more long-lasting protection
when compared with unfused antigens. These results suggest that iBioModulator
lichense fusions could improve vaccine effectiveness by boosting antibody
levels, cellular immune responses, and prolonging the period of protection
offered by a vaccine.
- 10-


In order to extend this data, iBio, Inc. intends
    to further study the value of LicKM by developing other vaccines using the
    iBioModulator technology. Lichenase fusion vaccine candidates for other viral
    diseases will be created, and evaluated against non-fused antigens for protective
    immunoglobulin titers and for length of the protective immune response. In
    addition, we will run additional studies to extend the earlier data from
    HPV-lichenase vaccines, and continue to collect immunoglobulin titer and
    length of protective immunization of yellow fever and malaria vaccine candidates
compared to non-fused vaccines.
Because the iBioModulator platform is based upon a protein from a
thermophilic organism, it is likely that it has evolved to be highly
thermostable. It is possible that vaccine antigen made as fusions to LickM may
be more thermostable than their native conformation. A more thermostable
vaccine would potentially require less stringent handling requirements,
reducing or eliminating cold chain refrigeration or freezing requirements,
and thereby simplifying the distribution and access to critical vaccines. iBio,
Inc. intends to study the thermostability of vaccine antigens made as lichenase
fusions to evaluate whether this technology offers benefits in this area.
Throughout the course of these programs to validate the iBioModulator
fusion molecule, the Company intends to make periodic announcements of
scientific findings via publication in journals or direct public statements.
During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011,
    we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $4,981,000
    and $3,084,000, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We exclusively control intellectual property developed at FhCMB for
human health applications. We also exclusively control the veterinary field for
plant-made influenza vaccines. Our success will depend in part on our ability
to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products and
to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary
rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and
foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. 
We currently hold eight U.S. patents and three
    international patents. Additionally, we have fifteen U.S. and thirty-eight
    international patent applications pending. The latter includes numerous foreign
    countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan,
    New Zealand, and several countries in Europe. We continue to prepare patent
    applications relating to our expanding technology in the U.S. and abroad.

Sales and Marketing
We currently expect to obtain feasibility, IND-enabling, or Phase 1 or
equivalent human clinical data for each product produced with our platform
before negotiating license or marketing agreements for that candidate. In some
cases, by bearing the initial product development risk ourselves, we expect to
be able to negotiate more favorable terms with our partners, and to achieve a
higher return on investment than would be possible with commercial agreements
negotiated at an earlier stage of development. However, in other cases,
especially where clinical characteristics of a candidate product are well known
such as for a bio-similar candidate, we anticipate our commercial partner
bearing substantially all of the clinical development costs of the product
using our platform.
We believe our technology platform will be attractive to other parties
for vaccine and therapeutic protein manufacturing purposes. We are marketing
our technology for such purposes and plan to provide commercial technology
transfer services to such third-party licensees in some cases after negotiating
such arrangements. Our strategy is to enter important markets through license
agreements and commercial collaborations. This is supported by an internal
technical program in which individual products are developed on the iBioLaunch
platform in preparation for clinical trials and regulatory approval in order to
demonstrate their availability and thereby attract license and collaboration
arrangements on terms favorable to the Company. Each product is chosen on the
basis of its individual commercial value and as representative of a class of
products in an attractive market to stimulate interest in other products of the
same class. 
We expect revenue from the multiple product categories to which the
iBioLaunch technology applies in geographical territories throughout the world.
For example, in countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China where the
economies and middle classes are growing rapidly, the capital and cost
advantages of the iBioLaunch system are attractive for pure commercial and
geopolitical reasons to decision-makers focused on building a domestic
biologics infrastructure to service domestic demand. 
In all geographic regions, including the U.S. and Western Europe, the
robust ability of the iBioLaunch platform to favorably produce virtually all
biologics, including its ability to produce product candidates that are
otherwise not feasible to manufacture, offers us the opportunity to obtain
value through exclusive, individual product licenses which can be worldwide or
geographically limited. Contemplated deal structures are based on the value of
the product application and the competitive strength of the potential partner. 
The size and timing of license payments and completion of collaboration
agreements may vary over a wide range. We have begun discussions or
negotiations related to the commercialization of certain product targets
produced successfully using our platform. We believe we will be able to
establish collaboration and license agreements with other companies for the
commercialization of these product targets, which include: the iBioLaunch
platform-produced human plasma proteins, alpha-1 antitrypsin and C-1 esterase
inhibitor; our orphan drug designated human alpha-galactosidase A; certain
human monoclonal antibodies; and certain protein targets that are proprietary
to third parties. In addition, we expect to advance additional vaccine
candidates produced using our platform, if an equity funding is received and we
can adequately advance our current product pipeline. 
FhCMB has demonstrated efficacy of an anthrax vaccine candidate and an
anthrax-plague combination vaccine candidate in relevant animal model challenge
studies. With funding from government sources, preclinical studies required for
human safety evaluation are nearing completion. Our strategy for introduction
of these products into the market includes partnership with one or more firms
experienced in biodefense product commercialization and federal government
procurement. We have not yet begun negotiations to obtain such a partnership
arrangement. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by
rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on
proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources,
including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic
institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions.
Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer
side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators
may develop based on the use of our platform technology.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources
and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we
do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant
competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established
companies, and this may reduce the value of our platform technology for the purposes
of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete
with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management
personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for
clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses
complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for
support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional
work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product
candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting
multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the
subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not
preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different
- 12 -


approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any
of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug
candidate under development by a customer.
There are currently approved therapies for the
    diseases and conditions addressed by our vaccine and therapeutic protein
    candidates that are undergoing clinical trials and for the diseases and conditions
    that are the subjects of our platform validation and preclinical development
    programs. There are also a number of companies working to develop new drugs
    and other therapies for diseases of commercial interest to us that are undergoing
    various stages of testing including clinical trials. The key competitive
    factors affecting the success of our platform for commercial product candidates
    are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, price, and convenience.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S.
    and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing
    and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. All of the vaccine and
    therapeutic products developed from our platform technology will require
    regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization.
    In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous
    preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval
    requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In
    the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations,
    also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping
    and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking
    required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable
    statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources.
    Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates,
    may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses
    for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, approved drugs
    and manufacturers are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously
    unknown problems that may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale
    or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Please see Risk Factors for
    additional information on the regulatory risks we face in attempting to develop
    products for human use.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human
subjects in the U.S., we must satisfy stringent government requirements for
preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the
safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. In vitro refers to tests conducted with cells in culture
and in vivo refers to tests
conducted in animals. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in
several animal species, as well as data from in
vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an
Investigational New Drug application (IND) and are reviewed by the FDA prior
to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must
provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific
rationale for the initial trials in human volunteers. In the case of candidate
vaccine products, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must
establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be
beneficial when administered to humans.
In order to test a new biologic product or vaccine in humans in the
U.S., an IND must be filed with the FDA. The IND will become effective
automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concern
or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to
that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any
outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. For additional
information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and
therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at
http://www.fda.gov.
Any products we or a licensee manufactures or distributes
    under FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by
    the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences
    with the products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required
    to register with the FDA and, where appropriate, state agencies, and are
    subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies
    for compliance with current cGMPs, which are the
standards the FDA requires be met during the manufacturing of drugs and
biologic products, and which impose procedural and documentation requirements
upon us and any third party manufacturers we utilize.
We will also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations
governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates.
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the
comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained
prior to manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The
approval process varies from country to country and the time needed to secure
approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We
cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be
accepted by other countries or that approval in one country will result in
approval in any other country. The product testing and clinical trial
requirements that must be met before a product candidate can be marketed are
substantial, time-consuming, and require investments of millions of dollars per
product candidate. 
Product Liability
Our business involves exposure to potential product liability risks
that are inherent in the development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical
products. 
Prior to our spin-off from our Former Parent, we maintained product
liability insurance for sales of our phytomineral products through Integrated
BioPharmas product liability insurance policy at $5 million per occurrence
with a $5 million aggregate. Our sales of phytomineral products continued to be
covered under Integrated BioPharmas product liability policy through April 1,
2009 when, as previously discussed, we entered into an agreement with a
subsidiary of Integrated BioPharma wherein we granted an exclusive 
- 13 -


license to that subsidiary to manufacture and sell phytomineral
products produced using the our patented process in consideration for a royalty
of five percent (5%) of net sales. We will need to purchase our own product
liability insurance policy to cover any of our clinical trial and product
liability risks. We anticipate that our product liability coverage will be at
least comparable to our prior coverage. However,



 


 


 




 


o


We may not
 be able to obtain product liability insurance for future trials;




 


 


 




 


o


We may not
 be able to obtain product liability insurance for future products;




 


 


 




 


o


We may not
 be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms;




 


 


 




 


o


We may not
 be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of our
 technology proceeds; or




 


 


 




 


o


Our
 insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.



Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable
cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Defending
a lawsuit would be costly and significantly divert managements attention from
conducting our business. If third parties were to bring a successful product
liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in
excess of insured liability limits, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially harmed.
Employees
As of September 14, 2012, we had seven employees. Our employees are not
represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining
agreement. We believe that we have a good relationship with them and expect
their numbers to increase by two or three full-time employees during the next
twelve months as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to advance
our business interests if we complete an offering of our securities. Since our
business strategy is based on outsourcing our development and clinical trial
work to third parties, we believe this staffing level will be sufficient to
meet our needs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our past experience may not be indicative of future performance, and as
noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have included
forward-looking statements about our business, plans and prospects that are
subject to change. Forward-looking statements are particularly located in, but
not limited to, the sections Business and Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition to the
other risks or uncertainties contained in this report, the following risks may
affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If any of
these risks occur, either alone or in combination with other factors, our
business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.
Moreover, readers should note this is not an exhaustive list of the risks we
face; some risks are unknown or not quantifiable, and other risks that we
currently perceive as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than
expected. Statements about plans, predictions or expectations should not be
construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of
action.
Risks Relating
to our Business 
Our plant-based
technology platform has not previously been used by others to successfully
develop commercial products, and if we are not able to establish licenses of
the platform, we may not generate sufficient license revenues to fulfill our
business plan.
If we are unable to convince others to adopt the use of the platform in
addition to or instead of other methods to produce vaccines and therapeutic proteins,
we will not generate the revenues presently contemplated by our business plan
to support our continuing operations.
The majority of our
product candidates are in the preclinical stage of development, and if we or
our licensees are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them, we
may not generate sufficient revenues to fulfill our business plan.
- 14 -


We have internal product candidates and believe our technology to be
applicable to the product candidates of other companies. Our success in
establishing licenses to our platform will substantially depend on our or our
clients successful completion of clinical trials, and obtaining required
regulatory approvals for our product candidates alone or with other persons. If
the studies described above or any further studies fail, if we do not obtain
required regulatory approvals, or if we fail to commercialize any of our
product candidates alone or with licensees, we may be unable to generate
sufficient revenues to attain profitability or continue our business
operations, and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community
would likely be significantly damaged, each of which would cause our stock
price to decline and your holdings of our stock to lose most, if not all, of
their value.
Our licensees will
not be able to commercialize product candidates based on our platform
technology if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or clinical
trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.
Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and
implement, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome.
Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that
later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical
trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our licensees may experience
numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and
the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the commercialization of
product candidates based on our technology, including the following:



 


 


 




 


o


Our licensees preclinical or clinical
 trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require
 additional preclinical testing, or clinical trials or the abandonment of projects
 that we expect to be promising. For example, promising animal data may be
 obtained about the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate and then human tests
 may result in no or inadequate immune responses. In addition, unexpected
 safety concerns may be encountered that would require further testing even if
 the vaccine candidate produced a very significant immune response in human
 subjects




 


 


 




 


o


Initial clinical results may not be
 supported by further or more extensive clinical trials. For example, a
 licensee may obtain data that suggest a desirable immune response from a
 vaccine candidate in a small human study, but when tests are conducted on larger
 numbers of people, the same extent of immune response may not occur. If the
 immune response generated by a vaccine is too low or occurs in too few
 treated individuals, then the vaccine will have no commercial value.




 


 


 




 


o


Enrollment in our licensees clinical
 trials may be slower than projected, resulting in significant delays. The
 cost of conducting a clinical trial increases as the time required to enroll
 adequate numbers of human subjects to obtain meaningful results increases.
 Enrollment in a clinical trial can be a slower-than-anticipated process
 because of competition from other clinical trials, because the study is not
 of interest to qualified subjects, or because the stringency of requirements
 for enrollment limits the number of people who are eligible to participate in
 the clinical trial.




 


 


 




 


o


Our licensee might have to suspend or
 terminate clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to
 unacceptable health risks. Animal tests do not always adequately predict
 potential safety risks to human subjects. The risk of any candidate product
 is unknown until it is tested in human subjects, and if subjects experience
 adverse events during the clinical trial, the trial may have to be suspended
 and modified or terminated entirely.




 


 


 




 


o


Regulators or institutional review boards
 may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including
 noncompliance with regulatory requirements.




 


 


 




 


o


Any regulatory approval ultimately obtained
 may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that
 render the product not commercially viable.




 


 


 




 


o


The effects of our licensees product
 candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side
 effects.



Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring
products to market before our licensees do and impair our ability to
commercialize our technology platform or products or product candidates based
on our technology platform. Poor clinical trial results or delays may make it
impossible to license a product or so reduce its attractiveness to a licensing
partner that we will be unable to successfully commercialize a product.
We will need
substantial additional funding to shepherd our product candidates through the
clinical testing process and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which
would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs
or commercialization efforts.
Our research and development expenses may increase in connection with
our ongoing activities, particularly if the scope of the clinical trials that
we are conducting expands. In addition, if we choose to bring forward any of
our product candidates without funding from collaborators, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing,
manufacturing and distribution.
- 15 -


We would need substantial additional funding and might be unable to
raise capital when needed or might be unable to raise capital on attractive
terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and
development programs or commercialization efforts.
We believe that our existing cash of approximately $5,624,000 as of
June 30, 2012 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements
through the end of the second calendar quarter of 2013 without an equity or debt offering or
up front milestone receipts from licensing arrangements including royalties. Our future funding requirements will depend on
many factors, including: 



 


 


 




 


o


Our ability to advance product candidates based on our technology
 into development with licensees; 




 


 


 




 


o


The success of our anticipated commercial agreements with licensees;




 


 


 




 


o


Our ability to establish and maintain additional development
 agreements or other alternative arrangements; 




 


 


 




 


o


The timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory
 approvals; 




 


 


 




 


o


The cost of manufacturing activities; 




 


 


 




 


o


The cost of commercialization activities, including marketing, sales
 and distribution; 




 


 


 




 


o


The costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and
 enforcing patent claims and other patent-related costs, including, if
 necessary, litigation costs and the results of such litigation; and 




 


 


 




 


o


Potential acquisition or in-licensing of other products or
 technologies. 



If we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital or other
alternative financing, we might have to defer or abandon our efforts to
commercialize our intellectual property and decrease or even cease operations. 
We have a limited
operating history, which may limit the ability of investors to make an informed
investment decision. 
We are a
clinical stage biotechnology company. To date, we have not commercialized any
of our technologies or received any FDA or other approval to market any
product. The successful commercialization of our technologies will require us
to perform a variety of functions, including:



 


 


 




 


o


continuing to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials;




 


 


 




 


o


participating in regulatory approval processes;




 


 


 




 


o


formulating and manufacturing products; and




 


 


 




 


o


conducting sales and marketing activities.



Our operations have been limited to organizing
    and staffing our Company; acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary
    technology; and undertaking, through third parties, preclinical trials and
    clinical trials of our Technologies. To date, we have completed a Phase 1
    clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H1N1 influenza and a Phase 1 clinical
    trial of a vaccine candidate for H5N1 influenza. These operations provide
    a limited basis for investors to assess our ability to commercialize our
technologies and whether to invest in us. 
Our product
development and commercialization involve a number of uncertainties, and we may
never generate sufficient revenues from the sale of potential products to
become profitable. 
We have generated no significant revenues to date. To generate revenue
and to achieve profitability, we must successfully develop licenses for our
platform and/or clinically test, market and sell our potential products. Even
if we generate revenue and successfully achieve profitability, we cannot
predict the level of that profitability or whether it will be sustainable. We
expect that our operating results will fluctuate from period to period as a
result of differences in when we incur expenses and receive revenues from sales
of our potential products, business arrangements and other sources. Some of
these fluctuations may be significant.
Until we can generate a sufficient amount of license
    and/or product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through
    public or private equity offerings, debt financings and corporate product
    or technology development agreements and licensing arrangements. If we raise
    additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience
    dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
    Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms,
    such as liquidation and other preferences, that are not favorable to us or
    our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through development and licensing
    arrangements with third parties, it will be necessary to relinquish valuable
    rights to our technologies, research programs or product candidates or grant
    licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
Even if we or our
potential licensees successfully complete clinical trials for our product
candidates, there are no assurances that we will be able to submit, or obtain
FDA approval of, a new drug application or biologics license application. 
- 16 -


There can be no assurance that, if clinical trials
    for any product candidates are successfully completed, either we or our licensees
    will be able to submit a biologics license application (BLA)
    to the FDA or that any BLA submitted will be approved by the FDA in a timely
    manner, if at all. After completing clinical trials for a product candidate
    in humans, a dossier is prepared and submitted to the FDA as a BLA, and includes
    all preclinical and clinical trial data that clearly establish both short-term
    and long-term safety for a product candidate, and data that establishes the
    statistically significant efficacy of a product candidate, in order to allow
    the FDA to review such dossier and to consider a product candidate for approval
    for commercialization in the United States. If we are unable to submit a
    BLA with respect to any of our product candidates, or if any BLA we submit
    is not approved by the FDA, we will be unable to commercialize that product.
    The FDA can and does reject BLAs and requires additional clinical trials,
    even when product candidates perform well or achieve favorable results in
    large-scale Phase III clinical trials. If we or our licensees fail to commercialize
    any product candidates based on our technology, we may be unable to generate
sufficient revenues to continue operations or attain profitability and our
reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be
damaged, each of which would cause our stock price to significantly decrease. 
We face competition
from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology
enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public
research institutions, and such competition may adversely affect our ability to
generate revenue from our products. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater
    financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development,
    manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals
    and marketing approved products.
Other companies may also prove to be significant competitors,
particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and
this may reduce the value of our platform technology for the purposes of
establishing license agreements. For example, Novavax is developing vaccines
for influenza, based on the use of cultured insect cells. Its candidate products
are more advanced in development than ours are and have already demonstrated
positive results in human clinical trials. Similarly, Medicago has announced
preclinical experiments to produce influenza vaccines in green plants. Other
companies, such as Vical, are attempting to develop vaccines based on the use
of nucleic acids rather than proteins. If these efforts are successful in
clinical trials, nucleic acid based vaccine technology may compete effectively
against our technology platform and may potentially prevent us from being able
to obtain commercial agreements or partnerships.
There are currently approved therapies for the diseases and conditions
addressed by our vaccine and antibody candidates that are undergoing clinical
trials and for the diseases and conditions that are subjects of our preclinical
development program. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated
if our competitors develop and commercialize products based on other technology
platforms that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less
expensive than any products that we or our licensees may develop.
Finally, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and
retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical
trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in
acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or
advantageous to our business. 
We will depend
significantly on arrangements with third parties to develop and commercialize
our product candidates. 
A key element of our business strategy is to establish arrangements
with licensees to develop and commercialize product candidates. We and FhCMB
currently are working within our business structure, which includes non-commercial
arrangements as described above, to apply further our plant-based platform
technology. Delays, withdrawals or other adverse changes to the current
participants in our business structure might adversely affect our ability to
develop and commercialize our product candidates.
We expect to rely upon our future business arrangements for support in
advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work
under current and future arrangements during our efforts to commercialize our product
candidates. Our contractors may be conducting multiple product development
efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements
with us. Our agreements might not preclude them from pursuing development
efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our
agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to
competition with a drug candidate under development by a contractor.
The success of our business arrangements will depend heavily on the
efforts and activities of the organizations which are party to these
arrangements. Our future contractual arrangements may provide significant
discretion in determining the efforts and resources available to these
programs. The risks that we face in connection with these arrangements, and
that we anticipate being subject to in future arrangements, include the
following: 



 


 


 




 


o


Future agreements may be for fixed terms and subject to termination
 under various circumstances, including, in some cases, on short notice
 without cause. 




 


 


 




 


o


Our future licensees may develop and commercialize, either alone or
 with others, products and services that are similar to or competitive with
 the products that are the subject of the agreement with us. 



- 17 -






 


 


 




 


o


Our future licensees may underfund or not commit sufficient resources
 to the testing, marketing, distribution or other development of our products.
 




 


 


 




 


o


Our future licensees may not properly maintain or defend our
 intellectual property rights, or they may utilize our proprietary information
 in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our
 proprietary information or expose us to potential liability. 




 


 


 




 


o


Our future licensees may change the focus of their development and
 commercialization efforts. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
 historically have re-evaluated their priorities from time to time, including
 following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years
 in these industries. The ability of our product candidates and products to
 reach their potential could be limited if our licensees or customers decrease
 or fail to increase spending relating to such products.



Business arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and other third
parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Such
terminations or expirations would adversely affect us financially and could
harm our business reputation. 
We have no
experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products
or in commercial technology transfer operations.
If we fail to establish commercial licenses for our platform technology
or fail to enter into arrangements with partners with respect to the sales and
marketing of any of our future potential product candidates, we might need to
develop a sales and marketing organization with supporting distribution
capability in order to directly market our technology and/or related products.
Significant additional expenditures would be required for us to develop such an
in-house sales and marketing organization. 
We may not be
successful in establishing additional arrangements with third parties, which
could adversely affect our ability to discover, develop and commercialize
products. 
We engaged FhCMB to perform research and development
activities to apply our platform technology to create product candidates. The Company and FhCMB have certain disagreements about
items invoiced by FhCMB to the Company and items invoiced by the Company to FhCMB pursuant to the various agreements between them.
According to FhCMB, as of June 30, 2012, the Company is not current in its payments to FhCMB.
We have similar arrangements for creation of
product candidates with another party, but these arrangements may not be scientifically or commercially successful. If we are unable
to resolve the account with FhCMB and also unable to obtain suitable services of the same kind from other parties, we may fail
to meet our business objectives for an affected product or program. Moreover, arrangements to create product candidates can be
complex to negotiate and time consuming to document, and if accomplished, could be less favorable to the Company than the current
arrangements with FhCMB and could, therefore, adversely affect our ability to discover, develop and commercialize products.
If third parties on
whom we or our licensees will rely for clinical trials do not perform as
contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory
approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business may
suffer. 
We do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials
required to obtain regulatory approval for our products. We have not yet
contracted with any third parties to conduct our clinical trials. We will
depend on licensees or on independent clinical investigators, contract research
organizations and other third party service providers to conduct the clinical
trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so. We will rely
heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials but
will not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the
investigators may not be our employees. However, we will be responsible for
ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the
general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not
complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in
accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of
these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the
development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. 
We face substantial
uncertainty in our ability to protect our patents and proprietary technology.

Our ability to commercialize our products will depend, in part, on our
ability to obtain patents, to enforce those patents and preserve trade secrets,
and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like us are highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.
We currently hold eight U.S. patents and three international patents.
Additionally, we have fifteen U.S. and thirty-eight international patent
applications pending. The latter includes numerous foreign countries including
Australia, Brazil Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, New Zealand, and
several countries in Europe. We continue to prepare patent applications
relating to our expanding technology in the U.S. and abroad.
There can be no assurance that: 



 


 


 




 


o


Patent applications owned by or licensed to us will result in issued
 patents; 




 


 


 




 


o


Patent protection will be secured for any particular technology;



- 18 -






 


 


 




 


o


Any patents that have been or may be issued to us will be valid or
 enforceable; 




 


 


 




 


o


Any patents will provide meaningful protection to us; 




 


 


 




 


o


Others will not be able to design around the patents; or 




 


 


 




 


o


Our patents will provide a competitive advantage or have commercial
 application. 



The failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection could
have a material adverse effect on us and may adversely affect our ability to
enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing of any
product. Please see Business  Intellectual Property for more information. 
We cannot assure you
that our patents will not be challenged by others.

There can be no assurance that patents owned by or licensed to us will
not be challenged by others. We currently hold one issued U.S. patent for
methods of inducing gene silencing in plants, two U.S. patents describing viral
vectors and methods for expressing polypeptides of interest in plants, two U.S.
patents involving methods for producing pharmaceutically active proteins in
sprouted seedlings, one US patent involving clonal root expression, one US
patent involving a thermostable recombinant carrier molecule, one U.S. patent
application for which we have received a notice of allowance describing Anthrax
antigens and vaccine compositions, and one U.S. patent describing systems for
expression of vaccine antigens in plants. Please see Business  Intellectual
Property for more information on our current patents and patent applications.
We could incur substantial costs in proceedings, including interference
proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and comparable
proceedings before similar agencies in other countries in connection with any
claims that may arise in the future. These proceedings could result in adverse
decisions about the patentability of our inventions and products, as well as
about the enforceability, validity or scope of protection afforded by the
patents. Any adverse decisions about the patentability of our product
candidates could cause us to either lose rights to develop and commercialize our
product candidates or to license such rights at substantial cost to us. In
addition, even if we were successful in such proceedings, the cost and delay of
such proceedings would most likely have a material adverse effect on our
business. 
Confidentiality agreements
with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade
secrets and other proprietary information, may not adequately protect our
intellectual property, and will not prevent third parties from independently
discovering technology similar to or in competition with our intellectual
property. 
We rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary
    information in our product development activities. To the extent we rely
    on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to maintain our competitive technological
    position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop
    the same or similar technologies. We seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary
knowledge, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees,
consultants, advisors, collaborators and contractors. Nevertheless, these
agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential
information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of
unauthorized disclosure of such information. If our employees, scientific
consultants, advisors, collaborators or contractors develop inventions or
processes independently that may be applicable to our technologies, product
candidates or products, disputes may arise about ownership of proprietary
rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will
not necessarily become our property, but may remain the property of those
persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary
to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If we fail to
obtain or maintain trade secret protection for any reason, the competition we
face could increase, reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting
our ability to attain or maintain profitability. 
If we infringe or
are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it will
adversely affect our business. 
Our research, development and commercialization activities, as well as
any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may
infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which
we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these
patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. These third
parties could bring claims against us or our customers, collaborators or
licensees that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful
against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent
infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they
could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales
of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.
As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid
potential claims, we or our customers, collaborators or licensees may choose to
seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most
likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may
not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our customers,
collaborators or licensees were able to obtain a license, the rights may be
nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual
property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or
be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of
actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our customers,
collaborators or licensees are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable
terms. This could harm our business significantly.
There have been substantial litigation and other
    proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to potential infringement
    claims against us, we may become a party to other patent
- 19 -


litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings
declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and opposition
proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property
rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any
patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be
substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such
litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their
substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the
initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.
Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management
time. 
There is a
substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we are unable
to obtain sufficient insurance, a product liability claim against us could
adversely affect our business. 
Clinical trial and product liability insurance is volatile and may
become increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain
sufficient insurance or increase our existing coverage at a reasonable cost to
protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our
business. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one
of our products or product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an
injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability
claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in: 



 


 


 




 


o


Liabilities that substantially exceed our product
     liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay from other sources,
     if available; 




 


 


 




 


o


An increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability
 to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, or at all; 




 


 


 




 


o


Withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers or patients; 




 


 


 




 


o


Damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products,
 resulting in lower sales of any future commercialized product which we may
 have; 




 


 


 




 


o


Regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or
 product modifications; 




 


 


 




 


o


Litigation costs; or 




 


 


 




 


o


The diversion of managements attention from managing our business. 



Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable
cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. If third
parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims
against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
harmed. 
If we acquire
companies, products or technologies, we may face integration risks and costs
associated with those acquisitions that could negatively impact our business,
results from operations and financial condition. 
If we are presented with appropriate opportunities,
    we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or
    technologies. We may not realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition
    or investment. If we acquire companies or technologies, we will face risks,
    uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process, including
    difficulties in the integration of the operations of an acquired company,
    integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our managements
    attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees
    or customers of the acquired business, and impairment charges if future acquisitions
    are not as successful as we originally anticipate. In addition, our operating
    results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization expenses
    or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. Any failure to successfully
integrate other companies, products or technologies that we may acquire may
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for
any additional future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could
be dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Current economic
conditions may cause a decline in business spending which could adversely
affect our business and financial performance. 
Our operating results are impacted by the health of the North American
economies. Our business and financial performance, including collection of our
accounts receivable, recoverability of assets including investments, may be
adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as a
reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility and
recession. Additionally, we may experience difficulties in scaling our
operations to react to economic pressures in the U.S. 
Our independent registered public
accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
Our independent registered public
accounting firm, CohnReznick LLP, communicated to our audit committee on February 14, 2012 that a material weakness existed in
our internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that disclosure controls were not effective as well. This weakness
resulted from the Company not considering modifications made to the terms of standard option award contracts. Additionally, the
subsequent computations of the impact of such modifications included errors which were not identified by the existing system of
internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s compensating detective controls were ineffective, resulting in material
adjustments to the timing and amount of stock based compensation recognized. This weakness resulted in additions and corrections
to disclosures in our December 31, 2011 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q prior to filing.
Our independent registered public
accounting firm, CohnReznick LLP, communicated to our audit committee on May 15, 2012 the aforementioned material weakness remained
in our internal control over financial reporting. During the third quarter ended March 31, 2012, the Company began remediating
this material weakness. However, the material weakness still existed with respect to detective controls as of the date of such
filing. During the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company remediated this material weakness related to those transactions
that are non-routine and complex. There have been no other changes over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
Future reoccurrence of such
material weakness could adversely affect our financial reporting.
Risks Relating to our Common Stock

We need additional
financing to execute our business plan which may not be available on
commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain such
financing, we will be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate part or all
of our operations and may not continue as a going concern.

We have limited financial resources and incurred net losses during the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. We need to obtain additional
financing to meet our working capital needs and execute our business plan.
Our independent registered public accounting firm
    has concluded that our cumulative and continuing losses, negative cash flow
    and accumulated deficit as of and for the year ended June 30, 2012 raise
    substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The inclusion
    of a going concern explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent
    registered public accounting firm may make it more difficult for us to secure
    financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and likely may adversely
    affect the terms of any financing that we may obtain.
If we are unable to raise funds when required or
    on acceptable terms, we may have to: a) significantly delay, scale back,
    or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more product
    candidates; b) seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage
    than would otherwise be desirable and/or on terms that are less favorable
    than might otherwise be available; or c) relinquish or otherwise dispose
    of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products that we would
otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves and/or cease operations. 
We have a history of
losses and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue and/or obtain
adequate amounts of financing in the future to support operations and/or
achieve profitability. 
We have incurred losses since inception. Through
    June 30, 2012, our expenses have primarily consisted of research and development
    and general and administrative expenses related to the development and commercialization
    of our proprietary technology. Our financial statements have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
We intend to continue to finance the development and commercialization
of our proprietary technology through revenue generated from licensing fees and
services provided to our clients and collaborators and/or raise additional
funds. 
- 21 -


If we are unable to generate revenues and/or raise
    funds when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to: a) significantly
    delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and/or commercialization
    of one or more product candidates; b) seek collaborators for product candidates
    at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable and/or on terms that
    are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or c) relinquish or
    otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products
    that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves and/or
cease operations. 
Our operating
results may vary significantly in the future which may adversely affect the
price of our common stock. 
It is possible that our operating results may vary
    significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our
    operating results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future.
    You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our
    future performance. It is also possible that in some future quarters our
    operating results will fall below our expectations or the expectations of
    market analysts and investors. If we do not meet these expectations, the
    price of our common stock may decline significantly. 
Provisions in our
charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that
stockholders may consider favorable. 
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation,
    bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or
    prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider
    favorable. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors
    may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. Any additional
    issuance of common stock could have the effect of impeding or discouraging
    the acquisition of control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy
    contest or otherwise, including a transaction in which our stockholders would
    receive a premium over the market price for their shares, and thereby protect
    the continuity of our management. Specifically, if in the due exercise of
    his/her or its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors were to determine
    that a takeover proposal was not in our best interest, shares could be issued
    by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval in one or more transactions
    that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of the
takeover by: 



 


 


 




 





Diluting the
 voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder
 group, 




 


 


 




 





Putting a
 substantial voting block in institutional or other hands that might undertake
 to support the incumbent Board of Directors, or 




 


 


 




 





Effecting an
 acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover. 



Our certificate of incorporation also allows our
    Board of Directors to fix the number of directors in the by-laws. Cumulative
    voting in the election of directors is specifically denied in our certificate
    of incorporation. The effect of these provisions may be to delay or prevent
    a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may determine to be
    in his, her or its best interest, including attempts that might result in
a premium over the market price for the shares held by the stockholders.
We also are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware
    General Corporation Law. In general, these provisions prohibit a Delaware
    corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested
    stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder
    became an interested stockholder, unless the transaction in which the person
    became an interested stockholder is approved in a manner presented in Section
    203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Generally, a business
    combination is defined to
include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial
benefit to a stockholder. In general, an interested stockholder is
a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three
years did own, 15% or more of a corporations voting stock. This statute
could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts
and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us. 
We do not anticipate
paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors
should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on
our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support
operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying
any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 
The sale of our
common stock through current or future equity offerings may cause dilution and
could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

We are entitled under our Certificate of Incorporation
    to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share,
    and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with no value. As
    of June 30, 2012, we had issued and outstanding 47,767,095 shares of common
    stock. We had 5,510,000 and 20,940,796 options and warrants outstanding as
    of June 30, 2012, respectively, to purchase common stock and 4,490,000 shares
    of common stock are reserved for issuance of additional grants under our
    2008 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Accordingly, we will be able to issue
    up to 21,292,109 additional shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
    preferred stock. Sales of our common stock offered through current or future
    equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.
    The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors,
    or anticipation of 
- 22 -


such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or
equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might
otherwise wish to effect sales. 
The issuance of
preferred stock or additional shares of common stock could adversely affect the
rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.

Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up
    to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the
    part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix
    and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and
    preferences of preferred stock. Currently, we have no shares of preferred
    stock outstanding. Our Board of Directors may, at any time, authorize the
    issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred
    right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments
    before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock, and the
    right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the
    redemption of our common stock, which may have a material adverse effect
    on the rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, our Board
    of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may, at any time, issue
    large blocks of preferred stock. In addition, the ability of our Board of
    Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on
    the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of our company and may
    prevent a transaction that is favorable to our stockholders. 
We could become
non-compliant with exchange listing standards. 
On November 4, 2011, the Company received notice from NYSE Amex LLC
(the Exchange) that the Company was below certain of the Exchanges continued
listing standards. The Exchange indicated that its review of the Companys Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, indicated that the Company was not in
compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv), which applies if a listed company has
sustained losses that are so substantial in relation to its overall operations
or its existing financial resources, or its financial condition has become so
impaired that it appears questionable, in the opinion of the Exchange, as to
whether the company will be able to continue operations and/or meet its
obligations as they mature.
The Company was afforded the opportunity to submit a plan of compliance
to the Exchange by November 28, 2011 that would demonstrate the Companys
ability to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv) of the Company Guide by
January 25, 2012.
The Company provided the Exchange with a satisfactory plan by November
28, 2011, to show that it would be able to return to compliance with Section
1003(a)(iv) of the Company Guide by January 25, 2012. Based upon subsequent
submissions by the Company to the Exchange on January 27, 2012, the Exchange
confirmed that the listing deficiency was resolved. Although the previous
listing deficiency was resolved, we cannot provide assurance that we will not
be out of compliance in the future. Any such non-compliance could cause our
common stock to no longer be listed on the Exchange, which could affect the
market price and liquidity of our common stock.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-Looking Statements

You should read the following discussion of our results of operations
and financial condition in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion
includes forward-looking statements and you should read the section titled
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing at the beginning of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the risks and assumptions
associated with such statements. 
Overview
iBio is a biotechnology company focused on commercializing
    its proprietary technologies, the iBioLaunch platform for vaccines
    and therapeutic proteins, as well as the iBioModulator platform for
    vaccine enhancement. Our strategy is to promote our technology, through commercial
    product collaborations and license arrangements. We expect to share in the
    increased value of our technology through upfront license fees, milestone
    revenues, service revenues, and royalties on end products. We believe our
    technology offers the opportunity to develop products that might not otherwise
    be commercially feasible, and to work with both corporate and government
    clients to reduce their costs during product development and meet their needs
    for low cost, high quality biologics manufacturing systems and vaccines with
    improved properties. Our near-term focus is to establish business arrangements
    for use of our technology by licensees for the development and production
    of products for both therapeutic and vaccine uses.
Vaccine candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary platform
are applicable to newly emerging strains of H1N1 swine-like influenza, H5N1
avian influenza, yellow fever, and anthrax.
Therapeutic candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary
platform include human alpha-galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry
disease, a modified version of human C-1 esterase inhibitor for the treatment
of hereditary angioedema and other diseases, human alpha-1 antitrypsin for
treatment of disorders caused by a lack or deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin,
and several other therapeutic protein targets including antibodies, for which
preliminary product feasibility has been demonstrated.
In order to attract appropriate licensees and increase the value of our
share of such intended contractual arrangements, we engaged the FhCMB in 2003
to perform research and development activities to develop the iBioLaunch
platform and to create our first product candidate. We selected a plant-based
influenza vaccine for human use as the product candidate to exemplify the value
of the platform. Based on research conducted by FhCMB, our proprietary
technology is applicable to the production of vaccines for any strain of
influenza including strains of H1N1 swine-like influenza. A Phase 1 clinical
trial of a vaccine candidate for H1N1 influenza, based on iBios technology,
was initiated in September 2010. We announced positive interim results in June
2011 and successfully completed the clinical trial in March 2012. The vaccine
candidate demonstrated strong induction of dose correlated immune responses,
with or without adjuvant, as assessed by virus microneutralization antibody
assays and HAI responses. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses
when administered with and without adjuvant.
In connection with the research and development agreement, FhCMB agreed
to use its best efforts to obtain grants from governmental and non-governmental
entities to fund additional development of our proprietary plant-based
technology. Consequently, in addition to the funding we have provided through
agreements to FhCMB, FhCMB has received funding from the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation for development of various vaccines based upon our proprietary
technology including an experimental vaccine for H5N1 avian influenza. A Phase
1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for H5N1 influenza, based on iBios
technology, was initiated in December 2010.We announced positive interim
results in June 2011 and successfully completed the clinical trial in March 2012.
- 24 -


In addition to the platform and product development engagements, in
2006, the Company engaged FhCMB to create a prototype production module for
products made through the use of the platform. The purpose of this engagement
was to demonstrate the ease and economy with which platform-based products
could be manufactured in order to attract potential licensees and increase the
value of our share of such business arrangements. The prototype design, which
encompasses the entire production process from seeding through pre-infiltration
plant growth, infiltration with agrobacteria, harvesting of plant tissue and
purification of target proteins, was completed in May 2008. A pilot plant based
upon this prototype was subsequently constructed in the FhCMB facility in
Newark, Delaware. This pilot plant, and the equipment in it, is owned by FhCMB
and has been validated for cGMP production. It is expected to be used for cGMP
production of protein targets for clinical trials of product candidates
utilizing our platform technology.
In January 2011, we announced the grant of a commercial,
royalty-bearing license to Fiocruz of Brazil to develop, manufacture and sell
certain vaccines based upon our proprietary technology. Fiocruz will invest
$6.5 million to bring the first product candidate, a yellow fever vaccine,
through a Phase I clinical trial. The World Health Organization has estimated
that 200,000 unvaccinated people contract yellow fever each year, and
approximately 30,000 die from the disease.
Development of the yellow fever vaccine candidate will be performed
through a commercial collaboration among the Company, Fiocruz, and FhCMB. The
license covers the nations of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. The
Company retains the right to sell the products developed under the license and
collaboration agreement in any other territory with a royalty back to
Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos. Bio-Manguinhos is a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation, a central agency of the Ministry of Health of Brazil.
Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos produces and develops immunobiological items to respond
to public health demands. Its product line consists of vaccines, reagents and
biopharmaceuticals. Fiocruz is a leading company in the national export of
human vaccines and a major participant in total export sales of the Brazilian
pharmaceutical sector. Fiocruz is one of the main producers of vaccines and
diagnostics for infectious diseases in Latin America. Fiocruz is a certified
World Health Organization provider to United Nations agencies, and is a leading
world manufacturer of yellow fever vaccine, which it has exported to over 60
countries.
In February, May and June 2012, we announced the issuance or allowance
of U.S. patents for, and scientific progress with potential product
applications of our iBioModulator platform, also referred to as our license
fusion-protein technology.
The Company established non-commercial arrangements among the Company,
certain government entities, NGO and FhCMB, pursuant to which the Company
grants non-commercial rights to use its platform for the development and
production by FhCMB of product candidates selected by the government entities
and NGO, in consideration for grants by the government entities and NGO
directly to FhCMB to fund such research and development.
Through (i) the Company/FhCMB contracts and (ii)
    the non-commercial arrangements described above (which we refer to collectively
    as the business
structure), the Company retains ownership of the intellectual property
and exclusive worldwide commercial rights in the fields of human health and
veterinary influenza applications of the intellectual property. The Company
licenses or otherwise grants use rights (a) to government and NGO entities for
not-for-profit applications of the intellectual property for the development
or application for which they granted or were granted funding, and (b) to FhCMB
for research purposes and applications in other fields. At this time, the
Company is not pursuing development in the area of veterinary influenza.
This business structure helps the Company to enhance
    the value of commercial rights and the scope of applications of its platform
    technology. It also helps the Company demonstrate the validity and apparent
    value of the platform to parties to whom it will offer licenses or other
    business opportunities. Outsourcing our research and development work allows
    us to develop our product candidates, and thereby promote the value of our
    platform for licensing and product development purposes, without bearing
    the full risk and expense of establishing and maintaining our own research
    and development staff and facilities. FhCMB is engaged to perform research
    and development for the yellow fever vaccine project based on their expertise.
    The contract with FhCMB is expected to be $6.5 million. Service revenues
    and research expense under this arrangement commenced in January 2011. The
    amount of revenues recorded under this agreement and related research and
    development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately
    $1,277,000 and $520,000, respectively. The Company invoices the customer
    in US dollars and also receives collection of the outstanding receivable
    in US dollars. Therefore, there are no foreign currency exchange translation
    gains or losses involved with this customer.
In July 2012 we announced a global alliance with
    GE Healthcare (GEHC)
to commercialize our plant-based technologies for the manufacture of
biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. The alliance is intended to build on the
existing development and marketing agreement between the two companies
announced in 2010 and to combine iBios proprietary iBioLaunch platform
with GEHCs capabilities in start-to-finish technologies for biopharmaceutical
manufacturing. Under the terms of the agreement, iBio will be the preferred provider
    of vaccine or therapeutic product manufacturing technology incorporating
    a plant based protein expression system, while GEHC will be the preferred
    provider of engineering services and bioprocess solutions, to any customers
    that may be interested in a bio-manufacturing facility incorporating a plant-based
    expression system. The agreement further specifies allocation of
responsibilities for product development, process scale-up, facilities design
and development, and technology transfer among iBio, FhCMB, and GEHC. The
Agreement also sets forth the terms of a non-exclusive license to iBios
technology that iBio has agreed to offer to any customer referred by GEHC
pursuant to the Agreement. 
- 25 -


The Companys platform technology is sometimes referred to as
iBioLaunch technology or the iBioLaunch platform, and the category of
this technology is sometimes referred to as plant-based technology or as a
plant-based platform.
The Company has exclusive control over, and the rights to ownership of,
the intellectual property related to all human health and veterinary influenza
applications of the plant-based technology developed by FhCMB. Current
development projects include conducting proof-of-principle preclinical studies
and conducting clinical studies of proprietary influenza vaccines.
Many biotech drugs have been on the market long
    enough for patents on them to expire. Emerging opportunities for biosimilars
    (also known as biogenerics or follow-on biologics) create potential for our
    platform technology to be used by potential licensees to enter the market
    utilizing what the Company expects to be an economical production system.
    The Company is seeking commercial partners for this category of products
    and is unlikely to develop products in this category without the financial
    and marketing support of a commercial partner.
Historically, in addition to the development of the platform technology
described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company has also generated sales of
nutritional supplements utilizing plants as sources of high-quality nutritional
minerals. The Company has a patented process for hydroponic growth of edible
plants that causes them to accumulate high levels of important nutritional
minerals such as chromium, selenium, iron and zinc. The Company utilized the
services of various wholly owned subsidiaries of our Former Parent to support
the production, marketing and sales of these phytomineral products.
Effective in April 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with IHT
Health Products, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of our Former Parent) (IHT)
wherein it granted an exclusive license to the Companys patented process in
consideration for a royalty of five percent (5%) of net sales and the obligation
of IHT to maintain in force and good standing the Companys patent and related
intellectual property. At the same time, rights under the existing customer
agreements were beneficially transferred to IHT. iBio receives royalty income
from the exclusive license to IHT.
In November 2007, the Board of Directors of our Former Parent approved
a plan to distribute its equity interests in the Company to its stockholders in
the form of a dividend. The record date of the dividend was August 12, 2008
with a distribution date of August 18, 2008. The stockholders of our Former
Parent received one share of the Companys common stock for each share of
common stock they owned of the Former Parent as of the record date. Immediately
following the spin-off, the Company became a public company with stock traded
on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol IBPM. The Companys stock was listed
for trading on the NYSE MKT in January 2011. 
Results of Operations

For the years ended June 30, 2012 versus June
30, 2011
Revenues 
Revenues for the years ended
    June 30, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1,277,000 and $520,000, respectively. Revenues were attributable to providing technology services
    to Fiocruz to assist them in implementing the Companys technology
     for a future Phase 1 clinical trial of yellow fever.
    The Company signed a contract with Fiocruz  in January 2011. There was no
     license income  for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.
Research and development expense 
Research and development expense for the year ended
    June 30, 2012 was approximately $4,981,000 compared to $3,084,000 for the
    year ended June 30, 2011, a difference of $1,897,000 from the comparable
    period in 2011. This increase primarily relates to approximately $757,000
    for FhCMB to service the yellow fever vaccine contract with Fiocruz using
    iBios
    technology. The Company increased its research and development activities
    during the year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to June 30, 2011 based upon
    several factors as follows. The Company entered into a research project
    (Project
    1)
    in December 2010 with FhCMB to evaluate gene expression and protein
    production, and to focus on a series of product candidates using the iBioLaunch
    platform, and the expenses related to Project 1 for the
    year ended June 30, 2012 increased by approximately $186,000 as compared
    to the comparable period in 2011. The focus was to determine feasibility
    and relative priority, for business development purposes, of several protein
    therapeutic candidates that are representative of market classes of products.
    For example, two market classes are monoclonal antibodies and plasma-derived
    proteins. The Company entered into an additional project with FhCMB (Project
    2) which was completed during the year ended June 30, 2012 and the related
    expenses to Project 2 increased by $161,000 for the year ended June 30, 2012
    as compared to the year ended June 30, 2011. This project is to evaluate the mechanism of
    immune-potentiating activity of LicKM, which is a thermostable bacterial
    enzyme used as a carrier molecule for vaccine antigens. Another increase
    in research and development expense is also attributed to the Company incurring
    approximately $225,000 for outside services to a related party, to perform
    laboratory feasibility analyses of gene expression and protein purification
and also preparation of research samples.
The Tech Transfer
    Agreement (TTA) with FhCMB has an annual obligation of $2 million
    for five years that commenced in 2009. This expense increased
    by $667,000 for the year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the year ended
    June 30, 2011. This was due to the build out of a Pilot Plant at FhCMB that
    was expensed during the year ended June 30, 2010. The accounting for the TTA
    is to expense such amounts as services are rendered. In addition, share-based
    compensation expense for options decreased the during the year ended June
30, 2012 as compared to the year ended June 30, 
- 26 -


2011 by approximately $138,000 primarily due to
    certain options that are revalued each reporting period using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model. The stock price is a component in the Black-Scholes
    calculation, which is used to compute fair market value. Changes in the Companys
    closing stock price can result in fluctuations in share-based compensation
    results between reported periods. 
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expense for the year
    ended June 30, 2012 was approximately $5,623,000 compared to $7,091,000 for the year ended
    June 30, 2011, a decrease of $1,468,000. The decrease is primarily attributed
    to a reduction in share-based compensation expense for warrants issued to
    consultants of approximately $1,015,000. Additionally, the Company recorded
    an impairment charge of approximately $87,000 and $586,000 during the fourth
    quarter of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Impairment expense decreased
    by $499,000 for the year ended June 30, 2012 as
    compared to the prior year. Evaluating for impairment requires judgment, including
    the estimation of future cash flows, future growth rates and profitability
    and the expected life over which cash flows will occur. Changes in the Companys
     business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment
    analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the
    excess of the carrying value over its estimated fair value. During the fourth
    quarter of the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company re-evaluated its business strategy
    and reviewed its product portfolio. After such review, the Companys
    near-term potential for upfront milestone revenue and/or licensing deals
    led to further evaluation of its intangible assets. Other decreases in general
    and administrative expenses include less expense for investment relations
    services of $185,000, past consulting services by the former CFO of approximately
    $128,000 and public company listing fees of approximately $99,000. There
    was a decrease in share-based compensation expense for options of approximately
    $135,000 that included two option modifications during the year ended June
    30, 2012. In November and December 2011, the Board of Directors modified
    the cancellation provision of previously issued options, permitting an option
    holder, upon termination without cause, to exercise the vested portion of
    an option post-termination up to ten years after the grant date. Current
    period option awards granted also include this provision. The Company estimates
    the effect of the modification to be approximately $633,000, which will be
    expensed over the vesting terms, of which approximately $616,000 is recorded
    in general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations. For
    the year ended June 30, 2012, the amount charged to general and administrative
    expense was approximately $552,000. The remaining amount of $64,000 will
    be expensed in subsequent periods over the vesting terms. Other increases
    relate to writing down an asset to its net realizable value of approximately
    $100,000, consulting services of $87,000, of which $75,000 was to a member
    of the Board of Directors, and payroll and benefits increased by approximately
    $464,000 relating to the hiring of two employees and an increase of overall
    salaries for existing officers. 
Other income (expenses) 
The derivative financial liability non-cash income
    for the year ended June 30, 2012 was approximately $3,668,000 as compared
    to a non-cash charge of approximately $2,474,000, for the year ended June
    30, 2011. This resulted in an increase of non-cash income of approximately
    $6,142,000 for the year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the comparable
    period in 2011. However, it was also affected by the
    issuance of additional warrants as a result of the January 2012 equity offering
    due to the anti-dilution provision that was part of the August 2008 equity
    offering. The increase in other income  change in
derivative financial liability of approximately $6,142,000  primarily results
    from decreases in the stock price at June 30, 2012 as compared to June 30,
    2011. The calculation of this derivative financial liability is affected
    by factors which are subject to significant fluctuations and are not under
    the Companys
    control. This liability resulted from warrants included in the August 2008
    equity offering with an anti-dilution provision. Therefore, the resulting
    effect upon our net income or loss is subject to significant fluctuations
    and will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations until the warrants
    either expire in August 2013 or are exercised prior to that date. The accounting
    guidance applicable to these warrants requires the Company (assuming all
    other inputs to the pricing model remain constant) to record a non-cash charge
    when the Companys stock price is rising and to record non-cash income
when the Companys stock price is falling. 
Net loss per share
Based upon the above, the net loss for the years
    ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 approximated $5,676,000 and $12,142,000 or
    $0.14 and $0.39 per share, respectively. The weighted average common shares
    outstanding  basic and
diluted for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011  were 39,505,561 and 30,968,798,
respectively. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company has incurred losses and negative cash
    flows from operations since the spinoff from its Former Parent in August
    2008. As of June 30, 2012, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately
    $31,338,000 and cash used in operating activities for the years ended June
    30, 2012 and 2011 approximated $6,010,000 and $5,338,000, respectively. The
    Company has historically financed its activities through the sale of common
    stock and warrants. Through June 30, 2012, the Company has dedicated most
    of its financial resources to investing in its iBioLaunch platform,
    advancing intellectual property, product candidate development, and general
    and administrative activities.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements were prepared under the
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of that uncertainty.
In addition, the Company estimates that the cash
    on hand as of June 30, 2012 of approximately $5,624,000 will be adequate
    to fund its operations until the end of the second calendar quarter of 2013.
    The Company plans to fund its further development and commercialization through
    licensing and partnering arrangements, which may include milestone receipts
    and royalties, and/or the sale of equity securities or debt. The Company
    cannot be certain that such funding will be available on acceptable terms
    or available at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional funds
    by issuing equity securities, its stockholders may experience dilution. Further,
    if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt, such
    instruments may have powers, designations, preferences or rights senior to
    its currently outstanding securities. If the Company is unable to raise funds
- 27 -


when required or on acceptable terms, it may have
    to: a) significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and/or
    commercialization of one or more product candidates; b) seek collaborators
    for product candidates at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable and/or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;
    or c) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product
    candidates, or products that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize
    itself and d) possibly cease operations. 
On July 26, 2011, the Company filed with the SEC
    a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, which was
    declared effective by the SEC on July 28, 2011. This Registration Statement
    allows the Company, from time to time, to offer and sell shares of common
    stock, preferred stock, warrants, purchase its securities and/or debt securities,
    up to a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million of such securities. The
Company raised gross proceeds of $10 million in January 2012 under this Registration
    Statement.
For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the
    Company had  net cash used in operating activities of approximately $6,010,000
    and $5,338,000, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for
    the year ended June 30, 2012, was primarily from the loss from operations
    of $5,676,000, which was adjusted for the effects of non-cash income for
    stock-based compensation expense, change in the fair value of the derivative
    financial liability, depreciation and amortization, impairment of intangible
    assets and a vendor concession by approximately $469,000. In addition, there
    were increases in cash for accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other receivables,
    other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling approximately
    $135,000. For the year ended June 30, 2011, the net cash used in operating
    activities was primarily from the loss from operations of approximately $12,142,000,
    which was adjusted for the effects of non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation
    expense, change in fair value of derivative instrument liability, depreciation
    and amortization and impairment of intangible assets of approximately $7,334,000.
    In addition, there were decreases in cash for accounts receivables, prepaid
    expenses, other receivables, other current assets, and accounts payable and
    accrued expenses totaling approximately $530,000.
For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, net
    cash used from investing activities was approximately $245,000 and $94,000,
    respectively,  which was primarily from additions for intangible assets.
For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the
    cash provided  by financing activities was approximately $9,036,000 and $7,366,000,
    respectively, which was primarily from the sale of common stock and warrants,
    net of expenses.
The Company acquired Technology from FhCMB through
    a TTA dated in December 2003, as amended. Terms of the TTA require the Company
    to: a) make payments to FhCMB of $2,000,000 per year for five years, aggregating
$10,000,000, for research and development services beginning in November 2009;
and b) pay FhCMB 1% of all receipts derived by the Company from sales of
products produced utilizing the Technology and 15% of all receipts derived by
the Company from licensing the Technology to third parties with an overall
minimum annual payment of $200,000 beginning with the twelve months ended
December 31, 2011. This agreement is for 15 years. For the years ended June 30,
    2012 and 2011, the expense approximated $2,200,000 and $1,533,000, respectively.
In December 2010, the Company and FhCMB entered
    into a $1,660,000 research services agreement to evaluate gene expression
    and protein production, focused on a series of product candidates, using
    the iBioLaunch platform. The expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and
    2011 was approximately $643,000 and $457,000, respectively.
Remaining minimum payments due under the commitments
    to FhCMB as of June 30, 2012 are as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates. The significant estimates are valuation and recovery
    of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of derivative
financial liability and income taxes and valuation of income taxes. 
Research and Development

Research and development costs primarily consist
    of salaries and benefits, research contracts for the advancement of product
    development, stock-based compensation, and consultants. The Company expenses
    all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. 
Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures the cost of employee services
    received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
    fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period during which
    an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
    the requisite service period. The grant-date fair value of
    employee share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. Compensation
    expense for options and warrants granted to non-employees is determined by
    the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
    instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. Compensation expense
    for options granted to non-employees is measured each period as the underlying
    options or warrants vest. 
Income Taxes 
- 28 -


The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or
expense in the period that the change is effective. Tax benefits are recognized
when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained. A valuation allowance
is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will either expire before the Company is able to realize the
benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. As of June 30, 2012 and
2011, the Company had recognized a valuation allowance to the full extent of
our net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of realization of the benefit
does not meet the more likely than not threshold.
The Company files a U.S. Federal income tax return
    as well as returns for various states. The Companys income taxes have
    not been examined by any tax jurisdiction since its spin off in August 2008.
    Uncertain tax positions taken on our tax returns will be accounted for as
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company will recognize interest
    and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and
    administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations. There were no liabilities
    recorded for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2012 or 2011. The open tax
    years, subject to potential examination by the applicable taxing
    authority, for the Company are 2008-2011.
Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys
Own Equity 
In accordance with the provisions of Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC) 815 Derivatives and Hedging the
    embedded August 2008 warrants are not considered indexed to our stock. As
    a result of the anti-dilution provision per the warrant agreement from the
    August 2008 equity raise, the August 2008 warrants were required to be accounted
    for as derivative financial liability and have been recognized as a liability
    on the balance sheet. The fair value of the derivative instrument liability
    is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected
    by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price, expected stock
    price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free interest rate.
     The derivative financial liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet
    date and any changes in fair value is recognized as component of other income
    (expense).
Intangible Assets 
The Company accounts for intangible assets at their historical cost and
records amortization utilizing the straight-line method over periods based upon
their estimated useful lives. Intellectual property is amortized over a period
from eighteen to twenty three years and patents over ten years. The Company
reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
such assets may not be fully recoverable. Evaluating for impairment requires
judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, future growth rates
and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur.
Changes in the Companys business strategy or adverse changes in market
conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an
impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its estimated
fair value.
During the fourth quarter of June 30, 2012, the
    Company re-evaluated its business strategy and reviewed its product portfolio.
    After such review, the Companys near-term potential for upfront,
    milestone revenue and/or licensing deals led to further evaluation of its
    intellectual property including its patents. The Company recorded an impairment
    charge of approximately $87,000 and $586,000 for the years ended June 30,
2012 and 2011, respectively.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2011, Accounting Standards Codification
    Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement was
    amended to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing
information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles. 
Impact of Inflation 
The Company does not believe that inflation has significantly affected
its results of operations. 
Seasonality 
Our operations are not impacted by seasonality. 
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
- 29 -


The Company invests its excess cash to ensure both liquidity and safety
of principal. Excess cash is invested in a strong financial grade institution
to reduce the Companys credit risk. At times, the Companys cash balances may
exceed federally insured amounts. 
The Company has an exposure to credit risk in its trade accounts
receivable from sales of it services. The entire accounts receivable and
service revenues are derived from one customer located in Brazil.
The Company was required to account for the August
    2008 warrants as derivative liabilities. The Company is required to mark
    to market in each reporting quarter the value of the embedded derivative
    and the August 2008 warrants. The Company revalues these derivative liabilities
    at the end of each reporting period. The periodic change in value of the
    derivative liabilities is recorded as either non-cash derivative gain (if
    the value of the embedded derivative and August 2008 warrants decrease) or
    as non-cash derivative loss (if the value of the embedded derivative and
    August 2008 warrants increase). Although the values of the embedded derivative
    and August 2008 warrants are affected by interest rates, the remaining contractual
    exercise period and the Companys stock volatility, the primary cause
    of the change in the values will be the price of the Companys common
    stock. If the stock price increases, the derivative financial liability will
    generally increase, and if the stock price decreases the derivative financial
    liability will generally decrease. This results in a non-cash expense or
    income to the Statements of Operations.
Item 8. Financial
Statements 
For a list of financial statements filed as part of this report, see
the Index to Financial Statements beginning at page F-1 of this Annual Report. 
Item 9. Changes
in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None. 
Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures 
(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and
procedures relative to their costs.
Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2012, our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective
to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
Our independent registered public
accounting firm, CohnReznick LLP, communicated to our audit committee on February 14, 2012 that a material weakness existed in
our internal control over financial reporting. This weakness resulted from the Company not considering modifications made to the
terms of standard option award contracts. Additionally, the subsequent computations of the impact of such modifications included
errors, which were not identified by the existing system of internal control over financial reporting. The Companys compensating
detective controls were ineffective, resulting in material adjustments to the timing and amount of stock based compensation recognized.
This weakness resulted in additions and corrections to disclosures in our December 31, 2011 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q prior
to filing.
During
the quarter ended March 31, 2012, the Company began remediating this material weakness. However, the material weakness still
existed with respect to detective controls as to the date of such filing. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, CohnReznick LLP, communicated to our audit committee on May 15, 2012 that the aforementioned
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist. The Companys
compensating detective controls were ineffective, resulting in material adjustments to the timing and amount of stock-based compensation
recognized. This weakness resulted in additions and corrections to disclosures in our March 31, 2012 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
prior to filing.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, we have remediated
this material weakness by implementing additional internal controls related to the review of modifications to option award contracts
and implementing additional review procedures of option award computations.
- 30 -


There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2012 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 (c) Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board
of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements,
management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment
included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.
Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting is effective as of June 30, 2012.
This annual report does not include an attestation
    report by CohnReznick LLP, our independent registered public accounting
    firm, regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting
    company, our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to
    audit by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules
    of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only
    managements
    report in this annual report.

Audit Committee
Our board has constituted an audit committee that is comprised of Mr.
Chang and Mr. McKey, Jr. Our
board has determined Mr. Chang to be an audit committee financial expert as
that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Board has
determined that Mr. Chang, based upon his experience, training and education,
qualifies as an audit committee financial expert by virtue of the fact that he
has (a) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
and financial statements; (b) the ability to assess the general application of
GAAP in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves; (c)
experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements
that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are
generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can
reasonably be expected to be raised by our financial statements as well as
experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities;
(d) an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting;
and (e) an understanding of audit committee functions.
The audit committee operates pursuant to a written charter, a copy of
which can be found on the Companys website at www.ibioinc.com, Corporate
Governance.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a written code of ethics within the meaning of Item 406
of SEC Regulation S-K, which applies to our principal executive officer and
senior financial officers, a copy of which can be found on the Companys
website at www.ibioinc.com, Corporate Governance. If we make substantive
amendments to the Code of Ethics that are applicable to our principal executive
or financial officers, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver
in a report on Form 8-K in a timely manner.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act requires our directors and executive
officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of
our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and
reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity
securities. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are
required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such
reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were
required, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent
beneficial owners were complied with, except that Messrs. Erwin, Kay, Russell,
McKey, Hill, Elliott, Chang and Ryan each filed one late report relating to a
grant of stock options, and Mr. Ryan filed a late initial report of his
appointment as an executive officer.

Employment Agreements
As of June 30, 2012, we did not have any employment contracts or other
similar agreements or arrangements with any of our named executive officers and the Board of Directors.
Incentive Compensation Plan
We have established an incentive compensation plan
    and have reserved 10,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued to employees
    under this plan. As of June 30, 2012, we granted stock options with an aggregate
    of 5,510,000 underlying shares of common stock and there are 4,490,000 reserved
for future issuances.
Director Compensation
Compensation for our non-employee directors has historically consisted
of a grant of stock options vesting over a three-year period and additional
cash compensation. We do not have a fixed policy with respect to this
compensation, but the compensation is generally equal for each non-employee
director except in cases where a director assumes additional responsibilities
above and beyond standard board service. Directors who are also our employees
will receive no additional compensation for their services as directors.

Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
Our Boards policy is to review with management and our independent
auditor any related party transactions brought to the Boards attention which
could reasonably be expected to have a material impact on our financial
statements. The Companys practice is for management to present to the Board
each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and
circumstances relating thereto, and to update the Board as to any material
changes to any approved related party transaction. In connection with this 
- 36 -


requirement, each of the transactions or relationships disclosed below
were disclosed to and approved by our Board. In addition, transactions
involving our directors and their affiliated entities were disclosed and
reviewed by our Board in its assessment of our directors independence
requirements.
Historical Relationship with Integrated
BioPharma, Inc.
We were a subsidiary of Integrated BioPharma from February 21, 2003
until August 18, 2008. As a result, in the ordinary course of our business, we
received various services provided by Integrated BioPharma, including treasury,
tax, legal, investor relations, executive oversight and other services.
Integrated BioPharma also provided us with the services of a number of its
executives and employees. Our historical financial statements include
allocations by Integrated BioPharma of a portion of its overhead costs related
to these services. These cost allocations have been determined on a basis that
we and Integrated BioPharma considered to be reasonable reflections of the use of
these services. 
Integrated BioPharmas Distribution of Our
Stock
As of June 30, 2008, Integrated BioPharma owned all of our common stock
until completion of the distribution on August 18, 2008. In connection with the
distribution, Integrated BioPharma distributed its equity interest in us to its
stockholders in a transaction that was intended to be tax-free to Integrated
BioPharma and its U.S. stockholders.
Agreements Between Integrated BioPharma and
the Company
We entered into the agreements listed below with Integrated BioPharma
prior to the completion of the distribution in the context of our relationship
as a subsidiary of Integrated BioPharma. The prices and other terms of these
agreements may be less favorable to us than those we could have obtained in
arms-length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties for similar services
or under similar agreements.
Separation and Distribution Agreement. The
separation and distribution agreement contains the key provisions relating to
the distribution by Integrated BioPharma to its stockholders of our common
stock.
On the distribution date, Integrated BioPharma and we entered into the
following ancillary agreements governing various ongoing relationships between
Integrated BioPharma and us following the distribution date:



 


 


 




 





an
 indemnification and insurance matters agreement;




 





a tax
 responsibility allocation agreement; and




 





a
 transitional services agreement.



To the extent that the terms of any of these ancillary agreements
conflict with the separation and distribution agreement, the terms of these
ancillary agreements govern. We describe these agreements more fully below. 
Intercompany Payable. As
of June 30, 2008, we were indebted to Integrated BioPharma in an amount of
approximately $7.9 million, as a result of the prior intercompany financial
relationship between our Company as a subsidiary and Integrated BioPharma as
the corporate parent. Immediately following the consummation of the
distribution, approximately $2.7 million of the then outstanding balance of the
intercompany payable was converted into equity as a capital contribution to us,
and, Integrated BioPharma owned 5.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock
as of the August 12, 2008 when also taking into account the completion of the
private placement as described herein. The remaining balance of approximately
$5.2 million was contributed to capital and did not result in any new shares
    of iBio being issued to Integrated BioPharma.
Information Exchange. We
and Integrated BioPharma agreed to share information with each other for use as
long as no law or agreement is violated, it is not commercially detrimental to
us or Integrated BioPharma, and no attorney-client privilege is waived:



 


 


 




 





to satisfy reporting, disclosure, filing and other obligations;




 


 


 




 





in connection with legal proceedings other than claims that we and
 Integrated BioPharma have against each other;




 


 


 




 





to comply with obligations under the agreements between Integrated
 BioPharma and us; and




 


 


 




 





in connection with the ongoing businesses of Integrated BioPharma and
 our Company as it relates to the conduct of these businesses before the
 spin-off.



Integrated
BioPharma and we also agreed:



 


 


 




 





to use reasonable commercial efforts to retain information that may
 be beneficial to the other;




 


 


 




 





and to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide the other with
 employees, personnel, officers or agents for use as witnesses in legal
 proceedings and any books, records or other documents that may be required by
 the other party for the legal proceedings.



- 37 -


Auditing Practices. We
agreed:



 


 


 




 





to provide Integrated BioPharma with all relevant information that
 Integrated BioPharma reasonably requires to enable Integrated BioPharma to
 prepare its quarterly and annual financial statements for quarters or years
 that include any financial reporting period for which our financial results
 are consolidated with Integrated BioPharmas financial statements;




 


 


 




 





to grant Integrated BioPharmas internal auditors access to the personnel
 performing our annual audits and quarterly reviews and the related work
 papers; and




 


 


 




 





not to change our accounting principles, or restate or revise our
 financial statements, if doing so would require Integrated BioPharma to
 restate or revise its financial statements for periods in which our financial
 results are included in Integrated BioPharmas consolidated financial
 statements unless we are required to do so to comply in all material respects
 with generally accepted accounting principles and SEC requirements. 



Expenses. Both
we and Integrated BioPharma paid our respective out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred with respect to the distribution.
Termination and Amendment of the Agreement. Neither
we nor Integrated BioPharma may terminate the separation and distribution
agreement at any time after the consummation of the distribution, which was
August 12, 2008, unless the other agrees.
Indemnification and Insurance Matters
Agreement
Indemnification. In
general, under the indemnification and insurance matters agreement, we agreed
to indemnify Integrated BioPharma, its affiliates and each of its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from all
liabilities that arise from:



 


 


 




 





any breach by us of the separation and distribution agreement or any
 ancillary agreement;




 


 


 




 





any of our liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets
 included in the information statement relating to the spin-off;




 


 


 




 





our assets or businesses;




 


 


 




 





the management or conduct of our assets or businesses;




 


 


 




 





the liabilities allocated to or assumed by us under the separation
 and distribution agreement, the indemnification and insurance matters
 agreement or any of the other ancillary agreements;




 


 


 




 





various on-going litigation matters in which we are named defendant,
 including any new claims asserted in connection with those litigations, and
 any other past or future actions or claims based on similar claims, facts,
 circumstances or events, whether involving the same parties or similar
 parties, subject to specific exceptions;




 


 


 




 





claims that are based on any violations or alleged violations of U.S.
 or foreign securities laws in connection with transactions arising after the
 distribution relating to our securities and the disclosure of financial and
 other information and data by us or the disclosure by Integrated BioPharma as
 part of the distribution of our financial information or our confidential
 information; or




 


 


 




 





any actions or claims based on violations or alleged violations of
 securities or other laws by us or our directors, officers, employees, agents
 or representatives, or breaches or alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by our
 board of directors, any committee of our board or any of its members, or any
 of our officers or employees.



Integrated BioPharma agreed to indemnify us and our affiliates and our
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from all liabilities
that arise from:



 


 


 




 





any breach by Integrated BioPharma of the separation and distribution
 agreement or any ancillary agreement;




 


 


 




 





any liabilities allocated to or to be retained or assumed by
 Integrated BioPharma under the separation and distribution agreement, the
 indemnification and insurance matters agreement or any other ancillary
 agreement;




 


 


 




 





liabilities incurred by Integrated BioPharma in connection with the
 management or conduct of Integrated BioPharmas businesses; and




 


 


 




 





various ongoing litigation matters to which we are not a party.



Integrated BioPharma is not obligated to indemnify us against any
liability for which we are also obligated to indemnify Integrated BioPharma.
Recoveries by Integrated BioPharma under insurance policies will reduce the
amount of indemnification due from us to 
- 38 -


Integrated BioPharma only if the recoveries are under insurance
policies Integrated BioPharma maintains for our benefit. Recoveries by us will
in all cases reduce the amount of any indemnification due from Integrated
BioPharma to us.
Under the indemnification and insurance matters agreement, a party has
the right to control the defense of third-party claims for which it is
obligated to provide indemnification, except that Integrated BioPharma has the
right to control the defense of any third-party claim or series of related
third- party claims in which it is named as a party whether or not it is
obligated to provide indemnification in connection with the claim and any
third-party claim for which Integrated BioPharma and we may both be obligated
to provide indemnification. We may not assume the control of the defense of any
claim unless we acknowledge that if the claim is adversely determined, we will
indemnify Integrated BioPharma in respect of all liabilities relating to that
claim. The indemnification and insurance matters agreement does not apply to
taxes covered by the tax responsibility allocation agreement.
Insurance Matters. Under
the indemnification and insurance matters agreement, we will be responsible for
obtaining and maintaining insurance programs for our risk of loss and our
insurance arrangements will be separate from Integrated BioPharmas insurance
programs.
Offset. Integrated
BioPharma is permitted to reduce amounts it owes us under any of our agreements
with Integrated BioPharma, by amounts we may owe to Integrated BioPharma under
those agreements.
Assignment. We
may not assign or transfer any part of the indemnification and insurance
agreement without Integrated BioPharmas prior written consent. Nothing
contained in the agreement restricts the transfer of the agreement by
Integrated BioPharma.
Tax Responsibility Allocation
Agreement. In order to allocate our
responsibilities for taxes and certain other tax matters, we and Integrated
BioPharma entered into a tax responsibility allocation agreement prior to the
date of the distribution. Under the terms of the agreement, with respect to
consolidated federal income taxes, and consolidated, combined and unitary state
income taxes, Integrated BioPharma will be responsible for, and will indemnify
and hold us harmless from, any liability for income taxes with respect to
taxable periods or portions of periods ending prior to the date of distribution
to the extent these amounts exceed the amounts we have paid to Integrated
BioPharma prior to the distribution or in connection with the filing of
relevant tax returns. Integrated BioPharma is also responsible for, and will
indemnify and hold us harmless from, any liability for income taxes of
Integrated BioPharma or any member of the Integrated BioPharma group (other
than us) by reason of our being severally liable for those taxes under U.S.
Treasury regulations or analogous state or local provisions. Under the terms of
the agreement, with respect to consolidated federal income taxes, and
consolidated, combined and unitary state income taxes, we are responsible for,
and will indemnify and hold Integrated BioPharma harmless from, any liability
for our income taxes for all taxable periods, whether before or after the
distribution date. With respect to separate state income taxes, we are also
responsible for, and will indemnify and hold Integrated BioPharma harmless
from, any liability for income taxes with respect to taxable periods or
portions of periods beginning on or after the distribution date. We are also
responsible for, and will indemnify and hold Integrated BioPharma harmless
from, any liability for our non-income taxes and our breach of any obligation
or covenant under the terms of the tax responsibility allocation agreement, and
in certain other circumstances as provided therein. In addition to the
allocation of liability for our taxes, the terms of the agreement also provide
for other tax matters, including tax refunds, returns and audits.
Director Independence
Our board of directors has determined that Ms. Bassett and Messrs.
Chang, Elliott, Hill, McKey, Russell and Müsing are independent directors as
such term is defined in Section 803 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committees policy is to pre-approve all audit and
permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public
accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related
services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally detailed
as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject
to a specific budget. The independent registered public accounting firm and
management are required to periodically report to the audit committee regarding
the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting
firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services
performed to date. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services
on a case-by-case basis. The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering
of the services other than audit services by CohnReznick LLP is compatible with
maintaining the principal accountants independence.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of
Directors and Stockholders 
iBio, Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of iBio, Inc. as of
June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of iBio, Inc. as of
June 30, 2012 and 2011, and its results of operations and cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 
The accompanying financial statements have been
    prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
    in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses
    and negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended June
    30, 2012 and 2011 and has an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2012.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue
as a going concern. Managements plans regarding these matters are also
described in Note B. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

iBio, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements
NOTE A - BUSINESS
iBio,
Inc. (iBio and the Company) is a biotechnology company focused on
commercializing its proprietary technologies, the iBioLaunch platform for
vaccines and therapeutic proteins. Its also includes the iBioModulator
platform for vaccine enhancement. Our strategy is to promote our technology,
through commercial product collaborations and license arrangements. We expect
to share in the increased value of our technology through upfront license fees,
milestone revenues, service revenues, and royalties on end products. We believe
our technology offers the opportunity to develop products that might not
otherwise be commercially feasible, and to work with both corporate and
government clients to reduce their costs during product development and meet
their needs for low cost, high quality biologics manufacturing systems and
vaccines with improved properties. Our near-term focus is to establish business
arrangements for use of our technology by licensees for the development and
production of products for both therapeutic and vaccine uses. The Company
operates in one business segment.
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Liquidity and Basis of Presentation
The Company has incurred significant losses and
    negative cash flows from operations since its spinoff from its Former Parent,
    Integrated Bio Pharma, Inc. in August 2008. As of June 30, 2012, the Companys
    accumulated deficit was approximately $31,338,000 and had cash used in operating
    activities for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 of approximately $6,010,000
    and $5,338,000, respectively. The Company has historically financed its activities
    through the sale of common stock and warrants. Through June 30, 2012, the
    Company has dedicated most of its financial resources to investing in its
    iBioLaunch platform,
    advancing its intellectual property and general and administrative activities.
    Cash on hand as of June 30, 2012 was approximately $5,624,000 and is expected
    to support the Companys activities
through the end of the second calendar quarter of 2013.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements were prepared under the
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of that uncertainty.
The Company plans to fund its development and commercialization
activities through the end of the second quarter of calender 2013 and beyond
    through milestone receipts from licensing arrangements including royalties
    and/or the sale of equity securities. The Company cannot be certain that
    such funding will be available on acceptable terms or available at all. To
    the extent that the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities,
    its stockholders may experience significant dilution. If the Company is unable
    to raise funds when required or on acceptable terms, it may have to: a) significantly
    delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and/or commercialization
    of one or more product candidates; b) seek collaborators for product candidates
    at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable and/or on terms that
    are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or c) relinquish or
    otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products
    that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself and possibly
    cease operations. 
In addition to the normal risks associated with a new business venture,
there can be no assurance that the Companys research and development will be
successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially
viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on
collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors
of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of
proprietary technology, and compliance with Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria
are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;
(ii) delivery of the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the
fees earned can be readily determined; and (iv) collectability of the fees
is reasonably assured.
Commencing in
February 2011, the Company recognized service revenue when earned. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.
    GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The significant estimates are valuation and recovery of intangible
assets, stock-based compensation expenses, valuation of derivative instruments
    and income taxes and valuation of income taxes.
F-7


Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company invests its excess cash to ensure both liquidity and safety
of principal. Excess cash is invested in a strong financial grade institution
to reduce the Companys credit risk. At times, the Companys cash balances may
exceed federally insured limits.
The Company has an exposure to credit risk in its
    trade accounts receivable from sales of its services. The entire accounts
    receivable and service revenues are derived from one customer that is located
    in Brazil. The Company invoices the customer in U.S. dollars.
The Company relies on the Center for Molecular Biotechnology of
Fraunhofer USA, Inc. (FhCMB) to perform the majority of its research and development.

Research and Development
Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits,
research contracts for the advancement of product development, stock-based
compensation, and consultants. The Company expenses all research and development
costs in the periods in which they are incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the
award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service
period.  The grant-date fair value of
employee share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. 
Compensation expense for options and warrants granted to non-employees
is determined by the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value
of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured.
Compensation expense for options granted to non-employees is measured each
period as the underlying options or warrants vests.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or
expense in the period that the change is effective. Tax benefits are recognized
when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained. A valuation allowance
is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will either expire before the Company is able to realize the
benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. As of June 30, 2012 and
2011, the Company had recognized a valuation allowance to the full extent of
our net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of realization of the benefit
does not meet the more likely than not threshold.
The Company files a U.S. Federal income tax return
    as well as returns for various states. The Companys income taxes have
    not been examined by any tax jurisdiction since its spin off in August 2008.
    Uncertain tax positions taken on our tax returns will be accounted for as
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company will recognize interest
    and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and
    administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations. There were no liabilities
    recorded for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2012 or 2011. The open tax
    years, subject to potential examination by the applicable taxing authority,
for the Company are 2008-2011.
Loss Per Share 
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the
    net loss allocated to common shares by the weighted average number of common
    shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
    the additional potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants
    were exercised or converted into common stock, using the treasury stock method.
    Since the Company incurred a net loss in each of those periods, diluted loss
    per share for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, were the
    same as basic loss per share. There were 26,450,796 and 12,298,607 options
    and warrants for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, that
    were excluded from the calculation of dilutive earnings per share since
they were anti-dilutive.
The following table summarizes the number of common shares excluded
from the calculations of weighted average common shares outstanding for the years
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments primarily
    include cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, other current assets
    and accounts payable. Due to the short-term nature of cash, accounts receivable,
    other receivables, current assets and accounts payable, the carrying amounts
of these assets and liabilities approximate their fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
    in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date.
    The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes
    the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. 
Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either
directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are not active;
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. 
The Company categorizes its derivative financial
    instrument liability in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The derivative financial
    liability relating to a warrant with an anti-dilution feature is valued using
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the derivative
    financial  liability is based principally on Level 2 inputs. For
    this liability, the Company developed its own assumptions based on observable
    inputs or available market data to support the fair value.
The following table sets forth the Companys
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring
basis, by input level, in the balance sheets at June 30, 2012 and 2011:

Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys
Own Equity 
In accordance with the provisions of Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC) 815 Derivatives and Hedging the
    embedded August 2008 warrants are not considered to be indexed to our stock.
    As a result of the anti-dilution provision per the warrant agreement from
    the August 2008 equity offering the August 2008 warrants were required
    to be accounted for as a derivative financial liability and have been recognized
    as a liability on the balance sheets. The fair value of the derivative financial
    liability is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and
    is affected by changes in inputs to that model including the Companys
    stock price, expected stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the
    risk-free interest rate. The derivative financial liability is subject to
    remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any changes in fair value is
    recognized as a component in other income (expenses).
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
    the estimated useful life of the related assets, which is three or five years.
Intangible Assets
The Company accounts for intangible assets at their
    historical cost and records amortization utilizing the straight-line method
    based upon their estimated useful lives. Intellectual property is amortized
    over a period from 18 to 23 years and patents over 10 years. The
    Company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying
    amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Evaluating for impairment
    requires judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, future
    growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows
    will occur. Changes in the Companys business strategy or adverse changes
    in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition
    of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its
    estimated fair value.
Reclassification
Certain items in the 2011 Financial Statements
    have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation. The primary reclassification
    relates to the presentation of stock-based compensation expense in the Statements
    of Cash Flows.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In May of 2011, ASC
    Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement was amended to develop common requirements for measuring
fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Intellectual property consists of Technology for
    producing targeted proteins in plants for the development and manufacture
    of novel vaccines and therapeutics for humans and certain veterinary applications
    (the Technology).
The Company originally acquired this Technology from FhCMB through a TTA in December
2003, as amended, for $3,600,000.
Terms of the TTA require
    FhCMB to provide the Company with research and development services related
    to the commercialization of the Technology and allow FhCMB to apply the Technology
    to the development and production of certain vaccines for use in developing
    countries as defined in the agreement. The most recent amendment to the TTA
    requires: a) the Company to make payments to FhCMB of $2,000,000 per year
    for five years, aggregating $10,000,000, for such services beginning in November
    2009; and b) FhCMB to expend at least equal amounts during the same timeframe
    for research and development services related to the commercialization of
    the Technology. Additionally, under the terms of the TTA and for a period
    of fifteen years: a) the Company shall pay FhCMB a defined percent (per the
    agreement) of all receipts derived by the Company from sales of products
    produced utilizing the Technology and a defined percentage (per the agreement)
    of all receipts derived by the Company from licensing the Technology to third
    parties with an overall minimum annual payment of $200,000 beginning with
    the twelve months ended December 2010; and b) FhCMB shall pay the Company
    a defined percentage (per the agreement) of all receipts from sales, licensing,
    or commercialization of the Technology in developing countries as described
above. 
Patents consist of payments for services and fees related to the
further development and protection of the Companys patent portfolio.
During the fourth quarter of June 30, 2011, the
    Company re-evaluated its business strategy and reviewed its product portfolio.
    After such review, the Companys near-term potential for upfront milestone
    receipts and/or licensing deals led to further evaluation of its intellectual
    property including its patents. The Company recorded an impairment charge
    of approximately $87,000 and $586,000 for the years ended June 30, 2012
    and 2011, respectively, which was charged to general and administrative expense
    in the accompanying Statements of Operations.

Amortization expense for intangible assets is recorded
    utilizing the straight-line method over periods ranging from 10 to 23 years,
    is included in general and administrative expenses, and was approximately
    $323,000 and $373,000 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
    The weighted average remaining life for intellectual property and patents
at June 30, 2012 was approximately 12 and 6 years, respectively. 
The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets for the
next five years and thereafter is as follows:

NOTE G  DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL LIABILITY
The Company was required to account for the August
    2008 Warrants (August 2008
    Warrants) as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. The
    Company is required to mark to market in each reporting quarter the value
    of the embedded derivative and the August 2008 Warrants.
    The Company revalues these derivative liabilities at the end of each reporting
    period. The periodic change in value of the derivative liabilities is recorded
    as either non-cash derivative gain (if the value of the embedded derivative
    and the August Warrants decrease) or as non-cash derivative loss (if
    the value of the embedded derivative and the August 2008 Warrants increase).
If the stock price increases, the derivative liability 
F-11


will generally increase and if the stock price
    decreases, the derivative financial liability will generally decrease.
    For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded non-cash
    income and non-cash expense of approximately $3,668,000 and ($2,474,000),
    respectively.
The
assumptions made in computing the estimated fair value for the derivative
financial liability using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows:

Federal net operating losses of approximately $5.5 million were used by
the Former Parent prior to June 30, 2008 and are not available to the Company.
The Former Parent allocated the use of the Federal net operating losses
available for use on its consolidated Federal tax return on a pro rata basis
based on all of the available net operating losses from all the entities
included in its control group.
Federal and state net operating losses of approximately
    $23.2 and $5.7 million, respectively, are available to the Company as of
    June 30, 2012 and will expire at various dates through 2032. These
    carryforwards could be subject to certain limitations in the event there
    is a change in control, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382,
    of the Company and have been fully reserved in the Companys
valuation allowance account as there is substantial doubt the Company and the Former Parent would be able use these net operating losses to offset future
taxable income before the net operating losses expire and the Company or the
Former Parent is able to realize the related benefit. The Company has a
research and development credit of approximately $400,000 at June 30, 2012.

NOTE J  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY 
October and November 2010
Between October 2010 and November 2010, the Company
raised $8,000,000 through the sale of 4,000,000 shares of common stock at $2.00
per unit. Additionally, each investor was issued a five-year warrant to purchase
4,000,000 shares of common stock at $2.20 per share. The Placement Agent was
paid $530,000 and was issued five-year cashless exercise warrants to purchase
249,324 shares of the Companys common stock at exercise prices ranging from
$2.16 to $2.30 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $7,235,644 from this
transaction.
Based upon the down round provisions from the
August 2008 equity offering, the following resulted (see Note B  Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments relating to derivative financial liability): 


 
 
 
 


 
1)
Issued 19,599 shares of common
stock to all the investors in the August 2008 offerings; and


 
 
 
 


 
2)
Adjusted the warrant
          agreements with all the investors in all the August 2008 offering to
          provide for the purchase of an additional 133,472 shares of common
    stock and adjusted the exercise prices as follows:


 
 
 
 


 
 
a)
Warrants for the purchase of
          1,350,073 shares of common stock at $2.78 per common share were revised
          to the purchase of 1,400,449 at $2.68 per common share; and 


 
 
 
 


 
 
b)
Warrants for the purchase of
          1,365,151 shares of common stock at $3.66 per common share were revised
          to the purchase of 1,448,247 shares of common stock at $3.45 per common share. 


January 2012 Units 
On January 13, 2012, the Company raised net proceeds
    of approximately $9,036,000 after offering expenses of approximately $964,000
    by issuing 15,385,000 shares of common stock at $0.65 per share and warrants
    to purchase 11,538,750 shares of common stock. The Company paid to the underwriter
    a fee of approximately $700,000. The common stock and warrants were
sold together as units (the Units), each Unit consisting of one share
of common stock and 0.75 of one warrant to purchase one share of common stock.
Each warrant has an exercise price of $0.88 per share and will be exercisable
after the first anniversary of issuance and will expire on the second
anniversary date of issuance. The warrants will be registered using the effective
shelf registration statement when the warrants are available for exercise. In
the event the Company issues rights, options or warrants to holders of its common
stock, the exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted for the anti-dilutive
effects of such an issuance. The Company used its effective registration statement
on Form S-3 for this offering. 
This equity offering triggered the anti-dilution
    provisions applicable to all August 2008 equity offering and the following
    resulted (see Note B  Fair Value of Financial Instruments relating
 to derivative financial liability): 



 


 


 


 




 


1)


Modification of the warrants issued to all the
     investors in the August 2008 offering to provide for the purchase of an
     additional 1,353,439 shares of common stock and adjustment of the exercise
     prices as follows:




 


 


 


 




 


 


a)


Warrants for the purchase of 1,400,449 shares of common stock at
 $2.68 per common share were revised to the purchase of 2,065,814 at $1.82 per
 share; and 




 


 


b)


Warrants for the purchase of 1,448,247 shares of common stock at
 $3.45 per common share were revised to the purchase of 2,136,321 shares of
 common stock at $2.34 per share. 



Stock-Based Compensation - Stock Options and Warrants
The Company accounts for options granted to employees by measuring the
cost of services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based
upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of that
award is then ratably recognized as expense over the period during which the
recipient is required to provide services in exchange for that award. Options
and warrants granted to consultants and other non-employees are recorded at
fair value as of the grant date and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the
end of each reporting period until such options and warrants vest, and the fair
value of such instruments, as adjusted, is expensed over the related vesting
period. Adjustments to fair value at each reporting date may result in income
or expense, depending upon the estimate of fair value and the amount of expense
recorded prior to the adjustment. The Company reviews its agreements and the
future performance obligation with respect to the unvested options or warrants
for its vendors or consultants. When appropriate, the Company will expense the
unvested options or warrants at the time when management deems the service
obligation for future services has ceased.
On August 12, 2008, the Company adopted the iBioPharma
    (former Parents) 2008 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan)
    for employees, officers, directors, or external service providers. Under
    the provisions of the Plan, the Company may grant options to purchase stock
    and/or make awards of restricted stock up to an aggregate amount of 10,000,000
    shares. There are 4,490,000 options available for future issuance under
    the Plan. Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options
    within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended, or non-statutory stock options at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors and as reflected in the terms of the written option agreement.
    Options granted under the Plan vest ratably at the end of each twelve month
    period and  a three or five year period from the date of grant.

The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate
the fair value of such instruments. The risk-free interest rate assumptions
were based upon the observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term
of the equity instruments. The expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero
as the Company has not paid any dividends since its inception and does not
anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected volatility
was based upon historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The Company
routinely reviews its calculation of volatility based upon historical prices,
expected changes in future volatility, the Companys life cycle, its peer
group, and other factors.
In November and December 2011, the Board of Directors
    modified the cancellation provision of previously issued options, permitting
    an option holder, upon termination without cause, to exercise the vested
    portion of an option post-termination for up to ten years after the grant
    date. Current period option awards granted also include this provision. Effective
    September 30, 2011, the Company ceased using the simplified method for share-based
    compensation expense and now estimates the expected term for each award to
    approximate its contractual term. Subsequent to September 30, 2011, the Company
    estimates the fair value of option awards, using the expected term for share-based
    compensation in its option-pricing model. The Company uses its historical
    stock price volatility consistent with the expected term of grant as the
    basis for its expected volatility assumption. The Company estimated the effect
    of the modification to be approximately $633,000. Such value was based upon
    the fair market value of the options prior to the modification and the fair
    market value after the modification. Accordingly, for the year ended June
    30, 2012 the Company recorded a modification charge to research and development
    and to general and administrative expenses of approximately $17,000 and $552,000
    respectively. The balance of $64,000 will be recorded over the remaining
    vesting period.
In May 2012, the Board of Directors modified an
    option agreement to change the terms to reinstate forfeited options for non-employee
    options. The Company estimated the effect of the modification to be approximately
    $35,000. Such value was based upon the fair market value of the options prior
    to the modification and the fair market value after the modification and
    will be expensed over the vesting terms. The amount that was recorded in
    research and development expense at June 30, 2012 was approximately $7,000
    and the Company is required to mark to market in each reporting period the
    value of the option and record an increase or decrease in the expense at
the end of each reporting date. 
During the years ended June 30, 2012
    and 2011, the Company granted options to members of the Board of Directors
    and Officers to purchase 960,000 and 1,910,000 shares of common stock,
    respectively. These options vest ratably on their anniversary each year from
    three to five years, expire in ten years from the date of grant, and have
    a weighted average exercise price of $1.90 and $2.54 per share, respectively.
    See Note K for related party transactions. During the years ended
    June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company granted options to employees to purchase
    200,000 and 230,000 shares of common stock, respectively. These options vest
    ratably on their anniversary each year for three years, expire in ten years
    from the date of grant, and have a weighted average exercise price of $1.37
    and $2.51 per share, respectively.
On March 1, 2012, the Company’s CSO ceased his employment as CSO and instead became a consultant
to the Company as its Chief Scientific Advisor. As of February 29, 2012, the former CSO had a prior outstanding option grant to
purchase 500,000 shares of common stock of which 200,000 were vested. As compensation for his prospective role as Chief Scientific
Advisor, the 300,000 unvested options that the former CSO had were allowed to continue to vest in accordance with the original
terms of his option award agreement. The fair market value of this non-employee option award at the date of grant for the unvested
options was $234,000, and will continue to be amortized over the vesting terms. The initial option was granted on February 25,
2010 with an exercise price of $0.87 per share, and expires in ten years subject to other vesting conditions. The remaining options
will vest ratably on January 1, 2013 and on each of the two subsequent anniversary dates.

The following assumptions were used to estimate
fair value or share-based compensation awards:


 
 
 


(1)
Includes the issuance of 133,472
          warrants that had a lower exercise price as a result of anti-dilution
    provisions from the August 2008 equity offering.


 
 


(2)
Includes the issuance of 1,353,472
          warrants that had a lower exercise price as a result of anti-dilution

The weighted
average fair value of warrants granted during the years ended June 30, 2012 and
2011 were $0.71 and $1.29, respectively, on the date of grant.
In October 2011, the Company issued 100,000 warrants
    to purchase common stock at $2.00 per share to a consultant for investor
    relations services. The warrant has a term for two years and the fair market
    value at the date of grant was $0.71 per share using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model.
In October 2010, the Company issued
a warrant to a marketing development firm to purchase 300,000 shares of common
    stock at $1.38 per share that expire in five years that were fully vested.
    This warrant was cancelled and the Company reissued warrants with the same
    terms to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at $1.38 per share. The reason
    for the reissuance of the warrants was to terminate the agreement. The Company
    accounted for the cancellation and reissuance of these warrants as a modification.
    As a result of this transaction, the difference between the estimated fair
    market value of the warrants at the date of modification was recorded to
    expense using the Black-Scholes option-model. For the years ended June 30,
    2012 and 2011, the Company recorded an expense of approximately $0
    and $204,000, respectively, in general and administrative expenses.
In July 2010, the Company issued a warrant
to a financial advisor to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at $1.10 per
    share that expire in ten years. The warrants vested monthly and the Company
    recorded the estimated value at each month and revalues the unvested warrants
    at each reporting period until such warrants are fully vested. The Company
    recorded an expense for the years ended June 20, 2012 and 2011 of approximately
$18,000 and $874,000, respectively, to general and administrative expenses.
NOTE K - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



 


 


 




1)


During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011,
     the Company maintained a license agreement with its Former Parent.
     The Company earned royalties of approximately $34,000 and $23,000 during
     the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. A shareholder of the
     Company is also an officer of the Former Parent. 




 


 




2)


During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011,
     the Company had four service arrangements with the Center for Molecular
     Biotechnology of Fraunhofer USA, Inc. (FhCMB) for research and
     development. During part of the year ended June 30, 2012 and the entire
     year ended June 30, 2011, the Companys CSO was an Executive Officer
     of FhCMB. Since March 1, 2012, this former CSO has a consulting agreement
     to be the Companys
     Scientific Advisor.




 


 


 




 


A)


In 2003, the Company entered into a TTA which
     requires FhCMB to provide the Company with research and development services
     related to the commercialization of the Technology and allows FhCMB to apply
     the Technology to the development and production of certain vaccines for
     use in developing countries as defined in the agreement. The most recent
     amendment to the TTA requires: 1) the Company to make payments to FhCMB
     of $2,000,000 per year for five years, aggregating $10,000,000, for such
     services beginning in November 2009; and 2) FhCMB to expend at least equal
     amounts during the same timeframe for research and development services
     related to the commercialization of the Technology. Additionally, under
     the terms of the TTA and for a period of 15 years: 1) the Company shall
     pay FhCMB a defined percent (per the agreement) of all receipts derived
     by the Company from sales of products produced utilizing the Technology
     and a defined percentage (per the agreement) of all receipts derived by
     the Company from licensing the Technology to third parties with an overall
     minimum annual payment of $200,000 beginning with the twelve months ended
     December 2010; and 2) FhCMB shall pay the Company a defined percentage (per
     the agreement) of all receipts from sales, licensing, or commercialization
     of the Technology in developing countries as defined in the agreement. All
     new intellectual property invented by FhCMB during the period of the TTA
     is owned by and is required to be transferred to iBio. The expense for the
     year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $2,200,000 and $1,533,000,
     respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2010, the Company expensed
     the second $1,000,000 obligation under this agreement to pay for
     a cGMP plant at FhCMB. Because of the timing of the obligation, there was
     no prepaid balance to expense during the year ended June 30, 2011. The Company
     has consistently applied the accounting treatment as the expense is recorded
     and as services are rendered. The Company is charged interest by FhCMB on
     certain outstanding balances at prime plus 2 percent.




 


 


 




 


B)


In December 2010, the Company and FhCMB entered into a $1,660,000
 research services agreement to evaluate gene expression and protein
 production, focused on a series of product candidates, using the iBioLaunch platform.
 The expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was approximately
 $643,000 and $457,000, respectively.




 


 


 




 


C)


In March 2011, the Company
     and FhCMB entered into a $432,000 research services agreement for the evaluation
     of the mechanism of immune-potentiating activity of lichenase (LicKM),
     which is a thermostable bacterial enzyme used as a carrier molecule for
     vaccine antigens. The value of LicKM is as an immunomodulator. Fraunhofer
     completed their research during the year ended June 30, 2012 and the Company
     recorded the entire cost of the agreement as of June 30, 2012. The expense
     for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $296,000 and $135,000 respectively. 




 


 


 




 


D)


In January 2011, the Company has a commercial, royalty-bearing
 license to Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos (Fiocruz) of Brazil to develop,
 manufacture and sell certain vaccines based upon our proprietary technology.
 Fiocruz is expected to invest $6,500,000 to bring the first product
 candidate, a new yellow fever vaccine, through a Phase I clinical trial. iBio
 engaged FhCMB to perform research and development activity in conjunction
 with this contract. The expected research and development expense to service
 this opportunity is approximately $6,500,000. The Company does not expect
 to

earn a profit until it receives a license fee.
     The expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was approximately
     $1,277,000 and $520,000, respectively. 


 
 
 


 
E)
Pursuant to an agreement, FhCMB
         is required to reimburse the Company for patent related costs. Included
         in current receivables and other current assets as of June 30, 2012
         and 2011, there is approximately $177,000 and $223,000, respectively.
         The Company recorded a $100,000 vendor concession to general and administrative
         expenses and reduced the asset to its net realizable value during the
    year ended June 30, 2012.

On February 1, 2012, the Company entered into
     a consulting agreement with a member of the Board of Directors, primarily
     for business development. The agreement is for six months at $15,000 per
     month and 60,000 options to purchase common stock at $0.93 per share. These
     options vest in six equal monthly installments of 10,000 and expire in ten
     years. The consulting expense for the year ended June 30, 2012 was $75,000.
     The Company pays an annual fee of $10,000 to a member of the Board of Directors
     per year. The aggregate expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011
     was $85,000 and $1,000, respectively.




 


 


 




 


4)


On March 1, 2012, the Company’s CSO ceased his employment as CSO and instead became a consultant
to the Company as its Chief Scientific Advisor. As of February 29, 2012, the former CSO had a prior outstanding option grant to
purchase 500,000 shares of common stock of which 200,000 were vested. As compensation for his prospective role as Chief Scientific
Advisor, the 300,000 unvested options that the former CSO had were allowed to continue to vest in accordance with the original
terms of his option award agreement. The fair market value of this non-employee option award at the date of grant for the unvested
options was $234,000, and will continue to be amortized over the vesting terms. The initial option was granted on February 25,
2010 with an exercise price of $0.87 per share, and expires in ten years subject to other vesting conditions. The remaining options
will vest ratably on January 1, 2013 and on each of the two subsequent anniversary dates.




 


 


 




 


5)


The Company entered into an agreement during the
     year ended June 30, 2012, with a vendor, whose minority stockholder is the
     President of the Company. The vendor performs laboratory feasibility analyses
     of gene expression and protein purification and also preparation of research
     samples. The expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011  approximated
     $225,000 and $0, respectively. Included in accounts payable at June 30,
     2012 and 2011, was approximately $64,000 and $0, respectively.
