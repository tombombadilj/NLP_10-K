PART I  ITEM 1  BUSINESS  Graco Inc. and its subsidiaries
(Graco, us, we, or our Company) design, manufacture and sell equipment that pumps, meters, mixes, dispenses and sprays a wide variety of fluids and semi-solids. Primary users of our equipment include contractors and original equipment manufacturers,
who use our equipment in a wide variety of applications in the construction, manufacturing, processing and maintenance industries. Our equipment is used to paint, finish, fill, glue and seal a wide range of goods and materials. We sell our equipment
primarily through third-party distributors worldwide.  We sell our products in the following geographic markets: the Americas (North and South
America), Europe (including the Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. Sales in the Americas represent approximately 53 percent of our Companys total sales; sales in Europe approximately 24 percent; and sales in Asia Pacific approximately
23 percent. Part II, Item 7, Results of Operations and Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K contain financial information about these geographic markets. Our Company provides marketing, product design and
application assistance to, and employs sales personnel in, each of these geographic regions.  We classify our business into three reportable
segments, each with a worldwide focus: Industrial, Contractor and Lubrication. Financial information concerning these segments is set forth in Part II, Item 7, Results of Operations and Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements of
this Form 10-K.  Graco Inc. is a Minnesota corporation and was incorporated in 1926. For more information about our Company and its products,
services and solutions, visit our website at www.graco.com. The information on the website is not part of this report nor any other report filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Our Companys Strengths and Objectives  We invest in development of technologically superior, multi-functional, high quality products. We specialize in providing fluid handling equipment solutions for difficult-to-handle materials with high
viscosities, abrasive or corrosive properties and multiple component materials that require precise ratio control. Our products enable customers to reduce their use of labor, material and energy, improve quality and achieve environmental compliance.
 We provide a broad product offering to many industries. We consistently make significant investments in new product development and
manufacturing capabilities to provide high quality products. We strive to provide strong returns for our stakeholders. Our strong operating results are based on many factors, including strong partnerships with material suppliers, close relationships
with end users, and outstanding channel partners that add value. We make market leading investments in new product development, provide products to niche end users with stringent product requirements and provide best-in-class quality and delivery.
 All business segments target growth with new products, through global expansion, particularly in advancing economies, and in new markets.
Targeted acquisitions, and the worldwide addition of specialized sales employees and specialized distributors, are key components to our Companys growth strategy. We coordinate and drive these growth strategies across our geographic regions.
 Our Company has strong financial performance and operating leverage. We have well-positioned channel partners, including independent
distributors and selective big box retailers, throughout our geographic regions. Our aftermarket parts and accessories provide a recurring revenue stream.  Manufacturing and Distribution  Manufacturing is a key competency of Graco. Our
manufacturing is aligned with our business segments and is co-located with product development to accelerate new product development and improve our cost structure and enhance product quality. Our Company invests significant resources in maximizing
the quality, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness of our production operations by investing in equipment and doing critical machining, assembly and testing in-house. Products are manufactured in focused factories and product cells. We source raw
materials and components from suppliers around the world. The segments manage operations devoted to the manufacture of their products. Our corporate manufacturing staff provides oversight and strategic direction of our manufacturing resources. Our
corporate manufacturing staff also manages those factories not fully aligned with a single segment, and our warehouses, customer service and other shared corporate manufacturing functions. The majority of our manufacturing occurs in the United
States, but certain products are manufactured or assembled in the Peoples Republic of China (P.R.C.) and Belgium.  We distribute our
products from our warehouses to third party distributors, who sell Graco products to end-users or re-sellers. Outside of the U.S., our subsidiaries located in Belgium, the P.R.C., Australia, Japan and Korea distribute our Companys products to
third 
  3 


Table of Contents

party distributors in those regions. Expansion of distribution and sales outside of the United States, in particular in the Asia Pacific region, is a growth strategy of our Company. Our European
headquarters in Maasmechelen, Belgium, and our Asia Pacific headquarters in Shanghai, P.R.C. reinforce our long-term commitment to those regions.  During 2011, manufacturing capacity met business demand. Production requirements in the immediate future are expected to be met through existing facilities, the installation of new automatic and
semi-automatic machine tools, efficiency and productivity improvements, the use of leased space and available subcontract services.  For more
details on our facilities, see Item 2, Properties.  Product Development  Product development efforts are carried out in facilities located in Minneapolis, Anoka and Rogers, Minnesota; North Canton, Ohio; and Suzhou, P.R.C. The product development and engineering groups in each
segment focus on new product design, product improvements, new applications for existing products and strategic technologies for their specific customer base. Our product development efforts focus on bringing new and supplemental
return-on-investment value to end-users of our products. Total product development expenditures for all segments were $42 million in 2011, $38 million in 2010, and $38 million in 2009.  Our Company strives to generate 30 percent of our annual sales from products introduced in the prior three years. In 2011, we generated 20 percent of our sales from new products. In 2010, the percentage
of sales represented by new products was 27 percent and in 2009 it was 26 percent.  Business Segments 
Industrial Segment  The
Industrial segment is the largest of our Companys businesses and represents approximately 56 percent of our total sales. This segment includes the Industrial Products and the Applied Fluid Technologies divisions. End users of our industrial
equipment require solutions to their manufacturing and maintenance challenges and are driven to purchase our industrial equipment by the return on investment that our products provide. The Industrial Products division markets its equipment and
services to customers who manufacture, assemble, maintain, repair and refinish products such as appliances, vehicles, airplanes, electronics, cabinets and furniture, and other articles. In addition to marketing its equipment to customers in similar
industries, the Applied Fluid Technology division also sells to contractors who use its plural component equipment to apply foam insulation and protective coatings to buildings and other structures. 
Most Industrial segment equipment is sold worldwide through general and specialized third-party distributors, integrators, design centers, original
equipment manufacturers and material suppliers. We also work with material suppliers to develop or adapt our equipment for use with specialized and hard-to-handle materials. Distributors promote and sell the equipment, hold inventory, provide
product application expertise and offer on-site service, technical support and integration capabilities. Integrators implement large individual installations in manufacturing plants where products and services from a number of different vendors are
aggregated into a single system. Design centers engineer systems for their customers using our products. Original equipment manufacturers incorporate our Companys Industrial segment products into systems and assemblies that they then supply to
their customers.  Industrial Products  The Industrial Products division focuses its product development and sales efforts on two main applications: equipment that applies paint and other coatings to products such as motor vehicles, appliances,
furniture and other industrial and consumer products (finishing); and process pump equipment that moves and dispenses chemicals and liquid and semi-solid foods (process pumps).  Our finishing equipment pumps, meters and applies liquids on all types of wood, metal and plastic. Manufacturers in the automotive, automotive feeder, truck/bus/recreational vehicle, military and utility
vehicle, aerospace, farm and construction, wood and general metals industries use our liquid finishing products. Our liquid finishing equipment includes paint circulating and paint supply pumps, paint circulating advanced control systems, plural
component coating proportioners, various accessories to filter, transport, agitate and regulate fluid, and spare parts such as spray tips, seals and filter screens. We also offer a variety of applicators that use different methods of atomizing and
spraying the paint or other coatings depending on the viscosity of the fluid, the type of finish desired, and the need to maximize transfer efficiency, minimize overspray and minimize the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air.
Our finishing application strategies include being a technology leader and providing environmental compliance solutions.  Our process pumps
move chemicals, petroleum, food and other fluids. Manufacturers and processors in the food and beverage, dairy, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, oil and gas, electronics, wastewater, mining and ceramics industries use our process pumps. We offer pumps for
sanitary applications including FDA-compliant 3-A sanitary pumps, diaphragm pumps, transfer pumps and drum and bin

unloaders. Our process pumps provide a mechanized solution to a traditionally manual process in a factory of moving fluids from large barrels into equipment that dispenses the fluid into jars or
other containers. In 2011, we purchased certain peristaltic pumps assets of Eccentric Pumps, LLC, providing us with an entry into the industrial peristaltic pump industry.  Applied Fluid Technologies  The Applied Fluid Technologies division directs its
engineering, sales and marketing efforts toward two broad types of applications: equipment to pump, meter, mix and dispense high performance protective coatings and polyurethane foam (protective coatings and foam); and equipment to pump, meter, mix
and dispense sealants, adhesives, molded polyurethane parts and composites (advanced fluid dispense).  We offer sprayer
systems and plural component proportioning equipment to apply protective coatings and foam to a wide variety of surfaces.
Reactor® plural component pumps are used to apply foam to insulate things such as walls, water heaters,
refrigeration, and hot tubs, create commercial roofing membranes and for packaging, architectural design and cavity filling. This equipment is also used to apply two-component polyurea coatings to tanks, pipes, roofs, truck beds and foundations. In
2011, we expanded the Reactor offering by introducing an entry-level unit in response to needs of the Chinese marketplace and a unit that targets air sealing and insulation in existing homes. Gracos XM Plural-Component Sprayer series is
and XP70 plural component sprayers are used for corrosion-control applications such as tank and pipeline coatings, shipbuilding, marine and railcar maintenance, wind tower coating, bridge and infrastructure projects and coating structural steel. The
XM sprayers provide precise and variable ratio control in a highly configurable system. The XP70 sprayers are fixed ratio units and intended for applications where variable ratio capability is not required. 
Our Company offers pumps, meters, applicators and valves for the metering, mixing and dispensing of precision beads of sealant and adhesive to bond,
mold, seal, vacuum encapsulate, pot, laminate and gasket parts and devices in a wide variety of industrial applications. The HFR Metering System is an in-plant, hydraulic, fixed-ratio metering system that applies a range of materials used for
noise dampening, insulation and structural integrity. We also offer advanced composites equipment, which includes gel coat equipment, chop and wet-out systems, resin transfer molding systems and applicators , which are used for example in the
manufacture of vehicles, aircraft, boats, wind turbines and bridge materials.  In 2011, we entered into an agreement with
H.B. Fuller Company pursuant to which Graco will provide specialized equipment that will pump, process and dispense
Liquamelt® adhesive manufactured by H.B. Fuller. The Liquamelt system is a new alternative to adhesive systems
that provides cool on delivery, hot on demand technology.  Key product strategies of the Applied Fluid Technologies division are
to maintain technology leadership in plural component applications, process controls, and electric pumps; and to offer a full range of best-value standard products by using a standardized, modular product structure, with pre-engineered products to
cover a broad range of configurations and applications.  Contractor Segment 
The Contractor segment generated approximately 33 percent of our Companys 2011 total sales. The Contractor segment directs its product development,
sales and marketing efforts toward three broad applications: paint, texture, and pavement maintenance. The Contractor segment markets airless paint and texture sprayers (air, gas, hydraulically- and electrically-powered), accessories such as spray
guns, hoses and filters and spare parts such as tips and seals to professional painters in the construction and maintenance industries, tradesmen and do-it-yourselfers. The products are distributed primarily through distributor outlets whose main
products are paint and other coatings. Contractor products are also sold through general equipment distributors. Certain sprayers and accessories are distributed globally through the home center channel. 
Contractor equipment encompasses a wide variety of sprayers, including sprayers that apply markings on roads, parking lots, fields, bike paths,
crosswalks and floors; texture to walls and ceilings; highly viscous coatings to roofs; and paint to walls and structures. Many of these sprayers and their accessories contain one or more technological features such as micro-processor-based controls
for consistent spray and protective shut-down, a pump that may be removed and re-installed without tools, an easy-clean feature, gas/electric convertibility, and a durable pump finish. We offer a line of professional grade handheld paint sprayers,
and in 2011, we introduced a fine finish handheld paint sprayer that sprays lacquers, varnishes, urethanes, sealers, stains and enamels. Contractor equipment also includes pressure washers, and scarifiers that remove markings on roads and other
surfaces.  Continual technological innovation and broad product families with multiple offerings are characteristic of our Contractor segment.
Painters are encouraged to upgrade their equipment regularly to take advantage of the new and/or more advanced features. Strategies of the Contractor segment include expanding base markets using new and core technologies. 
Contractor products are marketed and sold in all major geographic areas. In 2011, we continued to add distributors throughout the world that specialize
in the sale of particular Contractor products as we expand our product offerings. In Europe and Asia Pacific, we 
  5 


Table of Contents

are pursuing a broad strategy of converting contractors accustomed to the manual application of paint and other coatings by brush and roller to spray technology. This requires extensive in-person
demonstration of the productivity advantages, cost savings and finish quality of our spray equipment. This also requires the conversion of local paint distributors who may have a different method of selling their product. 
Lubrication Segment  The
Lubrication segment represented approximately 11 percent of our Companys sales during 2011. The Lubrication segment focuses its engineering, marketing and sales efforts on two main lubrication applications: vehicle services and industrial. The
Lubrication segment markets and sells our lubrication equipment worldwide, although the bulk of its sales come from North America. Products are distributed in each major geographic region. Our lubrication products are sold through independent third
party distributors and oil jobbers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers. Our key Lubrication segment strategies are to provide products with differentiated features that are unique to the industries served, and to develop products for
geographic expansion. In 2011, our Lubrication segment further expanded its focus on new industries and global end-user needs.  We supply
pumps, hose reels, meters, valves and accessories to the motor vehicle lubrication industry. Our customers include fast oil change facilities, service garages, fleet service centers, automobile dealerships and auto parts stores. 
In industrial lubrication, we offer systems, components, and accessories for the automatic lubrication of industrial and commercial equipment,
compressors, turbines, and on- and off-road vehicles. Industries served include gas transmission and petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining and construction, agricultural equipment, food and beverage, material handling, metal manufacturing and wind
energy. We offer products that automatically lubricate bearings, gears and generators, and products that evacuate and dispense oil, grease, anti-freeze and hydraulic fluids, from wind power components. 
Raw Materials  The primary materials
and components that we use in our manufacturing processes are steel of various alloys, sizes and hardness; specialty stainless steel and aluminum bar stock, tubing and castings; tungsten carbide; electric and gas motors; injection molded plastics;
sheet metal; forgings; powdered metal; hoses; and electronic components. The raw materials and components that we use are generally adequately available through multiple sources of supply. In order to manage cost, we continue to increase our global
sourcing of materials and components, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.  During the first half of 2011, the prices of aluminum, nickel,
copper, steel, rubber, plastics, and tungsten carbide significantly increased over 2010 pricing levels. During the second half of the year, prices of these materials stabilized, with some exceptions. Nickel, copper, and aluminum declined
significantly from mid-2011 pricing levels. Prices of specialty plastics have increased significantly from mid-2011 pricing levels. The March 2011 tsunami in Japan had no major impact on our ability to obtain the materials and components that we had
previously sourced in that geography.  We endeavor to address fluctuations in the price and availability of various materials and components
through adjustable surcharges and credits, close management of current suppliers, price negotiations and an intensive search for new suppliers. Worldwide electronic component supply shortages have increased lead times on these components. We have
performed risk assessments of our key suppliers of electronic components and other commodities, and we factor the risks identified into our commodity plans.  Intellectual Property  We own a number of patents and have patent applications pending
both in the United States and in other countries, license our patents to others, and are a licensee of patents owned by others. In our opinion, our business is not materially dependent upon any one or more of these patents or licenses. Our Company
also owns a number of trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, including registered trademarks for GRACO, several forms of a capital G, Airlessco, ASM, and various product trademarks that
are material to our business, inasmuch as they identify Graco and our products to our customers.  Competition 
We face substantial competition in all of our markets. The nature and extent of this competition varies in different markets due to the depth and breadth
of our Companys products. Product quality, reliability, design, customer support and service, personal relationships, specialized engineering and pricing are the major competitive factors in the industries we serve. Although no competitor
duplicates all of our products, some competitors are larger than our Company, both in terms of sales of directly competing products and in terms of total sales and financial resources. We also face competitors with different cost structures and
expectations of profitability and these companies offer competitive products at lower prices. We believe we are one of the worlds leading producers of high-quality specialized fluid handling equipment in the industries we serve.

Table of Contents
Environmental Protection  Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during the fiscal year ended
December 30, 2011.  Employees  As of December 30, 2011, we employed approximately 2,300 persons. Of this total, approximately 550 were employees based outside the United States, and 800 were hourly factory workers in the United
States. None of our Companys U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Various national industry-wide labor agreements apply to certain employees in various countries outside the United States. Compliance with such
agreements has no material effect on our Company or our operations.  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Changes in Laws and Regulations  Changes may impact how we can do business and the cost of doing business around the world. 
The speed and frequency of implementation of new laws and regulations globally appears to be increasing. In addition, as our business grows and/or
geographically expands, we may become subject to laws and regulations previously inapplicable to our business. These new laws and regulations are increasing our costs of doing business and may impact our long-term ability to provide returns to our
shareholders.  Economic Environment  Demand for our products depends on the level of commercial and industrial activity worldwide.
 An economic downturn or financial market turmoil, including the European sovereign debt crisis, may depress demand for our equipment in
all major geographies and markets. If our distributors and OEMs are unable to purchase our products because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms or are simply unwilling to purchase our products, our net sales and earnings will be
adversely affected.  Acquisitions  Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. Suitable acquisitions must be located, completed and
effectively integrated into or added to our existing businesses in order for this strategy to be successful.  We have identified
acquisitions as one of the strategies by which we intend to grow our business. If we are unable to obtain financing at a reasonable cost, are unsuccessful in acquiring and effectively integrating into or adding businesses to our current operations,
or do not realize projected efficiencies and cost-savings from the businesses we acquire, we may be unable to meet our growth or profit objectives.  Proposed Acquisition  Our proposed acquisition of the finishing business operations of Illinois Tool Works Inc. is subject to regulatory approvals and the expected benefits from the acquisition
may not be fully realized.  We have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the finishing business of Illinois Tools Works Inc.
(ITW) in a $650 million cash transaction. We cannot predict whether or when the required regulatory approvals will be obtained or if the closing conditions will be satisfied. On December 15, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an
administrative complaint against our Company, seeking to stop the acquisition, and commenced a civil lawsuit in United States District Court, seeking to temporarily enjoin us from acquiring the finishing business of ITW, pending resolution of the
administrative proceeding. The Court recently scheduled a trial on the FTCs motion to enjoin the transaction, commencing July 17, 2012. The purchase agreement with ITW allows for termination by either party after April 1, 2012. We continue to
have discussions with ITW and with the FTC regarding possible resolution. The FTC may condition approval of the acquisition on conduct remedies or the divestiture of certain products, certain product categories or other portion of the ITW finishing
business, which, if agreed to by the Company, may materially affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, and there can be no assurance that such a divestiture can be completed on terms satisfactory to us and the FTC. If we terminate
the agreement before April 1, 2012 due to failure to obtain regulatory approval, we will be required to pay a $20 million termination fee. If the transaction closes, significant changes to our financial condition as a result of global economic
changes or difficulties in the integration of the newly acquired businesses may affect our ability to obtain the expected benefits from the transaction or to satisfy the financial covenants included in the terms of the financing arrangements.
 Foreign Operations  Conditions in foreign countries and changes in foreign exchange rates may impact our sales volume, rate of
growth or profitability.  In 2011, approximately 56 percent of our sales were generated by customers located outside the United States.
Operations located outside the United States expose us to special risks, including the risk of terrorist activities, civil disturbances, environmental 
  7 


Table of Contents

catastrophes, supply chain disruptions, corruption, and special taxes, regulations and restrictions. Changes in foreign regulations could reduce our growth. We are increasing our presence in
advancing economies and political instability, war and volatile economic conditions that are more prevalent in these regions may adversely affect our revenues and net income. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies
will impact our reported sales and earnings and may make it difficult for some of our distributors to purchase products.  Suppliers 
Risks associated with foreign sourcing of raw materials and components, supply interruption, delays in raw material or component delivery or supply shortages may adversely affect our production or profitability. 
We are sourcing an increasing percentage of our materials and components from suppliers outside the United States, and from suppliers within the United
States who engage in foreign sourcing. Long lead times or supply interruptions associated with a global supply base may reduce our flexibility and make it more difficult to respond promptly to fluctuations in demand or respond quickly to product
quality problems. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies and fluctuations in the price of commodities may impact the manufacturing costs of our products and affect our profitability. Protective tariffs, unpredictable
changes in duty rates, and trade regulation changes may make certain foreign-sourced parts no longer competitively priced. Long supply chains may be disrupted by environmental events. Raw materials such as rare earth metals may become limited in
availability from certain regions.  Competition  Demand for our products may be affected by new entrants who copy our products and
infringe on our intellectual property.  From time to time, our Company has been faced with instances where competitors have intentionally
infringed our intellectual property and/or taken advantage of our design and development efforts. In some instances, these competitors have launched broad marketing campaigns. If our Company is unable to effectively meet these challenges, they could
adversely affect our revenues and profits and hamper our ability to grow.  Major Customers  Our Contractor segment depends on a few
large customers for a significant portion of its sales. Significant declines in the level of purchases by these customers could reduce our sales and impact segment profitability.  Our Contractor segment derives a significant amount of revenue from a few large customers. Substantial decreases in purchases by these customers, difficulty in collecting amounts due or the loss of their
business would adversely affect the profitability of this segment. The business of these customers is dependent upon the economic vitality of the construction and home maintenance markets. If these markets decline, the business of our customers
could be adversely affected and their purchases of our equipment could decrease.  Natural Disasters  Our operations are at risk of
damage or destruction by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes or unusually heavy precipitation.  The loss of, or substantial
damage to, one of our facilities could make it difficult to supply our customers with product and provide our employees with work. Our manufacturing and distribution facility in Minneapolis is on the banks of the Mississippi River where it is
exposed to flooding. Flooding could also damage our European headquarters and warehouse in Maasmechelen, Belgium, our factory in Suzhou, P.R.C., or our Asia Pacific headquarters in Shanghai, P.R.C. Tornadoes could damage or destroy our facilities in
Sioux Falls, Rogers, Minneapolis or Anoka and a typhoon could do the same to our facilities in Suzhou or Shanghai. An earthquake may adversely impact our operations in Suzhou, Shanghai, or Yokohama.

and Results of Operations  The following Managements Discussion and Analysis reviews significant factors affecting the

 Outlook  Overview
 Graco designs, manufactures and markets systems and equipment to pump, meter, mix and dispense a wide variety of fluids. The Company
specializes in equipment for applications that involve difficult-to-handle materials with high viscosities, materials with abrasive or corrosive properties and multiple-component materials that require precise ratio control. Graco sells primarily
through independent third-party distributors worldwide to industrial and contractor end-users. More than half of our sales are outside of the United States. Gracos business is classified by management into three reportable segments, each
responsible for product development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of their products. The segments are headquartered in North America. They have responsibility for sales and marketing in the Americas and joint responsibility with Europe and
Asia Pacific regional management for sales and marketing in those geographic areas.  Gracos key strategies include developing and
marketing new products, expanding distribution globally, opening new markets with technology and channel expansion and completing strategic acquisitions. Long-term financial growth targets accompany these strategies, including our expectation of 10
percent revenue growth and 12 percent net earnings growth.  Manufacturing is a key competency of the Company. Our management team in
Minneapolis provides strategic manufacturing expertise, and is also responsible for factories not fully aligned with a single division. Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the United States and distribution facilities are located in the
United States, Belgium, P.R.C., Japan, Korea and Australia.  In April 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the finishing businesses
of Illinois Tools Works Inc. (ITW) for $650 million in cash. The purchase agreement allows for termination by either party after April 1, 2012. The ITW businesses manufacture and distribute equipment for industrial liquid finishing, powder coating
and automotive refinishing, worldwide, with 2010 revenues exceeding $305 million annually. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint and commenced a civil lawsuit to challenge our purchase of these businesses. A trial on
the civil matter has been scheduled commencing July 17, 2012. We strongly believe the transaction is pro-competitive and will benefit both end users and distributor partners. We continue to have discussions with ITW and with the FTC regarding
possible resolution.  Results of Operations  Net sales, operating earnings, net earnings and earnings per share were as follows (in millions except per share amounts):

 2011 Summary: 


 

 
 Our revenues grew by 20 percent, with double-digit growth in all regions and segments. Fiscal 2010 included an additional week as compared to fiscal
2011. By region, sales increased by 17 percent in the Americas, 19 percent in Europe and 32 percent in Asia Pacific. Sales in the Industrial segment grew by 23 percent; sales in the Contractor segment grew by 13 percent and sales in the Lubrication
segment increased by 32 percent. 


 

 
 Foreign currency translation rates increased sales by $17 million and increased net income by $7 million in 2011 as compared to the translation rates
in 2010, with strength in Asian currencies and the euro during much of the year. 


 

 
 Operating earnings were $220 million as compared to $153 million in the prior year, and as a percentage of sales were 25 percent as compared to 21
percent in 2010. 
  15 


Table of Contents


 

 
 Net earnings totaled $142 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per share as compared to $103 million or $1.69 diluted earnings per share in 2010.



 

 
 Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales improved by 2 percentage points from 2010, due to higher production volumes, pricing and favorable
translation rates, partially offset by higher material costs. 


 

 
 Investment in new product development was $42 million or 5 percent of sales in 2011. 


 

 
 Total operating expenses were $30 million higher than 2010. Half of the increase was in selling, marketing and distribution expenses, including
strategic spending to generate and support growth, especially in Asia Pacific. General and administrative expenses for the year increased by $11 million, including $8 million related to the proposed acquisition of ITWs finishing businesses.



 

 
 The effective tax rate was 32 percent as compared to 31 percent in 2010. The rate in the prior year reflected the benefit from changes in unrecognized
tax benefits. 


 

 
 Cash flows from operations grew to $162 million compared to $101 million. Working capital investments to support the increased business included an
increase in inventories of $13 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $27 million. 


 

 
 We sold $300 million of unsecured notes in a private placement, with maturities of 7 to 15 years. An additional committed $450 million revolving credit
facility was also secured to fully finance the proposed acquisition of the ITW finishing businesses and provide additional liquidity for general business purposes. This revolving credit facility is contingent on closing of the proposed acquisition
and issuance of an additional $75 million in long-term notes. 


 

 
 Dividends totaled $51 million in 2011 and share repurchases totaled $43 million. 
2010 Summary: 


 

 
 Revenues grew by 28 percent, benefiting from the global industrial recovery and the Companys investments in new products, innovative technologies
and commercial capabilities to support geographic expansion. Sales growth in all segments and regions exceeded 20 percent. By region, sales increased 24 percent in the Americas, 25 percent in Europe and 46 percent in Asia Pacific. Sales in the
Industrial segment grew by 31 percent; sales in the Contractor segment grew by 23 percent and sales in the Lubrication segment increased by 35 percent. 


 

 
 Translation rates did not have a significant impact on sales and earnings in 2010. Changes in Asian currencies and the Canadian dollar largely offset
the effects of changes in the euro. 


 

 
 Operating earnings were $153 million as compared to $74 million in the prior year, and as a percentage of sales were 21 percent, up from 13 percent in
2009. 


 

 
 Net earnings totaled $103 million or $1.69 diluted earnings per share as compared to $49 million or $0.81 diluted earnings per share in 2009.



 

 
 There were 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. 


 

 
 Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales improved by
3 1/2 percentage points from 2009, mainly due to
reduction in unabsorbed manufacturing costs as compared to the prior year. Other factors contributing to improvement in the gross margin rate included selling price increases and lower pension costs in 2010, and costs related to workforce reductions
that lowered the 2009 rate. 


 

 
 Investment in new product development was $38 million or 5 percent of sales in 2010. 


 

 
 Total operating expenses were $32 million higher than 2009. The significant recovery in sales and earnings in 2010 resulted in higher incentive
expense, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the increase in operating expense for the year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased to

In 2011, sales in the Americas increased by 17 percent, with increases of 17 percent in the Industrial
segment, 13 percent in the Contractor segment and 25 percent in the Lubrication segment as compared to the prior year. Although residential and commercial construction activity remains low, industrial end-markets continued to strengthen in 2011.
 In 2011, sales in Europe increased by 19 percent or 14 percent at consistent translation rates, with increases of 23 percent in the
Industrial segment, 9 percent in the Contractor segment and 38 percent in the Lubrication segment. We continue to invest in commercial resources in the developing economies of Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and despite the Eurozone
sovereign debt crisis, industrial and lubrication end-markets continue to grow.  In 2011, sales growth in Asia Pacific was 32 percent or 27
percent at consistent translation rates, with an increase of 31 percent in the Industrial segment, 25 percent in the Contractor segment and 57 percent in the Lubrication segment. Additional commercial resources were added in each segment in Asia
Pacific in 2011, and our focus on new distribution to support these growing economies continued in 2011.  In 2010, sales in the Americas
increased by 24 percent overall, with increases of 26 percent in the Industrial segment, 22 percent in the Contractor segment and 23 percent in the Lubrication segment as compared to the prior year. Most end-markets strengthened in 2010, though some
select industries, such as residential and commercial construction, remain weak. More than half of the increase in the Contractor segment was due to new product launches.  In 2010, sales in Europe were strong across all segments, with an increase of 25 percent overall and 24 percent in the Industrial segment, 24 percent in the Contractor segment and 56 percent in the
Lubrication segment. Sales growth was strong throughout the region.  In 2010, sales growth in Asia Pacific was especially significant,
increasing 46 percent overall and exceeding pre-recession levels. Sales grew 49 percent in the Industrial segment, 24 percent in the Contractor segment and more than double the prior year sales in the Lubrication segment. The Company has continued
to invest in this region with additional commercial resources and focus on new distribution to support growing end markets.  The following

 2011 Compared to 2010  Operating earnings as a percentage of sales were 25 percent in 2011, up from 21 percent in 2010, with improvements in gross margins and expense leverage as compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was 56 percent in 2011 as compared to 54 percent in 2010, reflecting higher production volumes and
translation rates. Higher material costs were offset by manufacturing efficiencies and pricing.  Total operating expense increased $30 million
as compared to 2010, an improvement of 2 percentage points as a percentage of sales from the prior year. The higher costs include $8 million of transaction costs related to the proposed acquisition of the ITW finishing businesses, $4 million from
currency translation and increased selling and marketing costs, primarily related to promotional activities and additional headcount, primarily in Asia Pacific. Product development was $42 million or 5 percent of sales in 2011. Selling, marketing
and distribution costs were $151 million in 2011 as compared to $136 million in 2010. General and administrative costs were $88 million as compared to $77 million in the prior year.  Interest expense was $9 million in 2011 as compared to $4 million in 2010. The amount of debt more than doubled in 2011, as $300 million of proceeds from a private placement of notes were used to repay
revolving line of credit borrowings and invested in cash and cash equivalents.  The Companys effective tax rate was 32 percent in 2011,
higher than the effective tax rate of 31percent in 2010. The rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to U.S. business credits and the Domestic Production Deduction (DPD). Overall, the effect of the business
credits and domestic production deductions in 2011 was lower in 2011 as a percentage of pre-tax earnings as compared to the prior year. 
2010 Compared to 2009  Operating
earnings as a percentage of sales were 21 percent in 2010, up from 13 percent in 2009, with improvements in gross margins and expense leverage as compared to the prior year. Major factors for the improvement included improved product cost, mix and
pricing, reduced unabsorbed manufacturing costs and absence of workforce reduction costs incurred in 2009.  Gross profit margin as a
percentage of sales was 54 percent in 2010 as compared to 51 percent in 2009. Higher volume rates reduced unabsorbed manufacturing costs from $26 million in 2009 to $12 million in 2010 and accounted for approximately half of the improvement in gross
margins. Other factors contributing to improvement in the gross margin rate included selling price increases and lower pension costs in 2010, and costs related to workforce reductions that lowered the 2009 rate. 
Total operating expense increased $32 million as compared to 2009 and operating expense as a percentage of sales was
33 1/2 percent, decreasing from 37 1/2 percent the prior year. Higher incentive expense accounted for
approximately two-thirds of the increase. Investment in new product development was $38 million or 5 percent of sales in 2010. Selling, marketing and distribution costs were $136 million in 2010 as compared to $116 million in 2009. General and
administrative costs were $77 million as compared to $65 million in the prior year.  Interest expense was $4 million in 2010 as
compared to $5 million in 2009. Debt was reduced by $20 million in 2010 from the prior year.

Table of Contents
The Companys effective tax rate was 31 percent in 2010, higher than the effective tax rate of 29
percent in 2009. The rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to U.S. business credits, the Domestic Production Deduction (DPD) and changes in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from favorable tax rulings.
Overall, the effect of the business credits and domestic production deductions in 2010 was lower in 2010 as a percentage of pre-tax earnings as compared to the prior year.  Segment Results  The following table presents net sales and operating earnings by business

 In 2011, sales in the Industrial segment increased 23 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales
increased by 17 percent in the Americas, 23 percent in Europe (19 percent at consistent translation rates) and 31 percent in Asia Pacific (27 percent at consistent translation rates).  In 2011, operating earnings were $174 million or 35 percent of sales as compared to $126 million or 31 percent of sales in 2010, with the improvement mainly due to improved expense leverage. 
In 2010, sales in the Industrial segment increased 31 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales increased by 26 percent in the
Americas, 24 percent in Europe (27 percent at consistent translation rates) and 49 percent in Asia Pacific (44 percent at consistent translation rates).

Table of Contents
In 2010, operating earnings were $126 million or 31 percent of sales as compared to $68 million or 22
percent of sales in 2009, with the higher sales and resulting increases in production volume leading to improvement in operating earnings as a percentage of sales. One percentage point of the change in operating earnings is attributed to favorable
product cost, mix and selling prices, one percentage point is attributed to cost of workforce reductions in 2009, two percentage points is attributed to reduction in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and five percentage points is attributed to improved
expense leverage.  In this segment, sales in each geographic region are significant and management looks at economic and financial indicators
in each region, including gross domestic product, industrial production, capital investment rates, automobile production, building construction and the level of the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and various
Asian currencies.  Contractor  The following table presents net sales, components of net sales change and operating earnings as a percentage of sales for the Contractor segment (dollars in millions):

 In 2011, sales in the Contractor segment increased 13 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales
increased by 13 percent in the Americas, 9 percent in Europe (4 percent at consistent translation rates) and 25 percent in Asia Pacific (18 percent at consistent translation rates).  In 2011, operating earnings were $51 million as compared to $37 million in 2010, an improvement of 3 points as a percentage of sales from the prior year, primarily resulting from improved volume and
expense leverage.  In 2010, sales in the Contractor segment increased 23 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales increased
by 22 percent in the Americas, 24 percent in Europe (29 percent at consistent translation rates) and 24 percent in Asia Pacific (18 percent at consistent translation rates). In the Americas, the professional paint stores channel was the primary
driver of the sales increase, with more than half of the increase coming from the new handheld product line. The new handheld product was also a significant contributor to growth in Europe, though less significant in Asia Pacific due to product
launch late in the year.  In 2010, operating earnings were $37 million as compared to $29 million in 2009, or 14 percent of sales in both
years. Operating margin percentages were held down by costs and expenses related to new product introductions and expanding distribution as well as increase in volume-related items including incentives and distributor rebates. 
In this segment, sales in all regions are significant and management reviews economic and financial indicators in each region, including levels of
residential, commercial and institutional construction, remodeling rates and interest rates. Management also reviews gross domestic product for the regions and the level of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and other currencies.

 In 2011, sales in the Lubrication segment increased 32 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales
increased by 25 percent in the Americas (24 percent at consistent translation rates), 38 percent in Europe (34 percent at consistent translation rates) and 57 percent in Asia Pacific (49 percent at consistent translation rates). 
In 2011, operating earnings were $19 million or 18 percent of sales as compared to $9 million or 11 percent of sales for the prior year. The improvement
in operating earnings as a percentage of sales can be attributed to lower unabsorbed manufacturing costs and improved expense leverage.  In
2010, sales in the Lubrication segment increased 35 percent, with increases in all regions. By geography, sales increased by 23 percent in the Americas, 56 percent in Europe (61 percent at consistent translation rates) and more than doubled in Asia
Pacific. Sales of industrial lubrication products contributed significantly to the strong growth seen in 2010 and the Company began to benefit from the increase in dedicated commercial resources in Asia Pacific and Europe supporting this segment.
 In 2010, operating earnings were $9 million or 11 percent of sales as compared to an operating loss of $3 million in 2009. The improvement in
operating earnings as a percentage of sales can be attributed to improved product cost, mix and pricing (six percentage points), lower unabsorbed manufacturing costs (two percentage points) and improved expense leverage (six percentage points).
 Although the Americas represent the substantial majority of sales for the Lubrication segment and indicators in that region are the most
significant, management monitors indicators such as levels of gross domestic product, capital investment, industrial production and mining activity worldwide.  Unallocated corporate  (in millions)

 In 2011, the Companys financial condition and cash flows from operations were strong, with cash flows from
operations totaling $162 million. Our working capital investment increased in-line with increased sales volumes. Inventories increased by $13 million and accounts receivable increased by $27 million. Days of sales outstanding remained consistent
with the prior year. Other primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $24 million, dividends of $51 million and share repurchases of $43 million.  Cash flows from operations totaled $101 million in 2010. The primary uses of cash included increases in inventories of $33 million and accounts receivable of $24 million, dividends of $48 million, capital
expenditures of $17 million and a contribution of $10 million into the funded pension plan.  Capital Structure. At
December 30, 2011, the Companys capital structure included current notes payable of $9 million, long-term debt of $300 million and shareholders equity of $323 million.  Shareholders equity increased by $59 million in 2011. The key components of changes in shareholders equity include current year earnings of $142 million, reduced by $51 million of dividends
declared and $43 million of share repurchases.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. At December 30, 2011, the Company had cash
totaling $303 million, held in deposit accounts and short-term investments.  In March 2011, we entered into a note agreement and sold $150
million of unsecured notes in a private placement. One series of notes totaling $75 million bears interest at 4.0 percent and matures in 2018. Another series of notes totaling $75 million bears interest at 5.01 percent and matures in 2023. Under
terms of the agreement, we sold an additional $150 million of unsecured notes on July 26, 2011. One series of notes issued in July totaling $75 million bears interest at 4.88 percent and matures in 2020. Another series of notes issued in July
totaling $75 million bears interest at 5.35 percent and matures in 2026. Proceeds were used to repay revolving line of credit borrowings and invested in cash and cash equivalents, mostly money market funds. 
Under terms of the note agreement, interest is payable quarterly. We are required to maintain a debt to cash flow ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.00 and
an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. If a significant acquisition is consummated, the agreement allows, for a one-year period, for a cash flow leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50
to 1.00. The note agreement contains convents typical of unsecured credit facilities, including customary default provisions. If an event of default occurs, all outstanding obligations may become immediately due and payable. We are in compliance
with the financial covenants of the note agreement at December 30, 2011.  We plan to finance the proposed acquisition of the ITW
finishing businesses with borrowings under the long-term notes referenced above and with borrowings under a new revolving credit facility that would be funded upon closing of the transaction. In May 2011, we entered into a credit agreement providing
access to a $450 million unsecured revolving credit facility until May 2016. We may not obtain any loans under the credit agreement until certain conditions are met, including the closing of the transaction and receipt of not less than $75 million
in proceeds from the issuance of additional long-term notes.  In addition, various lines of credit totaling $269 million, including a $250
million, five year credit facility entered into in 2007 and $19 million with foreign banks were outstanding at year-end 2011. The unused portion of committed credit lines was $264 million at year-end. In addition, the Company has unused, uncommitted
lines of credit totaling $10 million. We have received a waiver from the lenders of the $250 million credit facility with respect to compliance with certain aspects of a covenant requiring minimum pension funding levels. We are in compliance with
all other financial covenants for this facility and other lines of credit.  We expect that contributions to the funded pension plan under
minimum funding requirements will not exceed $10 million and that the amounts payable in 2012 may be reduced by $7 million in available credits. We are considering making a cash contribution of $10 million to $20 million in 2012. 
Internally generated funds and the Companys other sources of financing are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to meet its
liquidity needs in 2012, including its capital expenditure plan of approximately $30 million, planned dividends (estimated at 
  22

$54 million) and acquisitions. If acquisition opportunities increase, the Company believes that reasonable financing alternatives are available for the Company to execute on those opportunities.
 In December 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys regular common dividend from an annual rate of $0.84 to
$0.90 per share, a 7 percent increase.  Cash Flow. A summary of cash flow follows (in millions):

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $162 million in
2011 and $101 million in 2010. During 2011, inventories increased by $13 million due to higher sales levels, new products and increased international distribution and accounts receivable increased by $27 million, in-line with higher sales levels.
 During 2010, $101 million was generated from operating cash flows, compared to $147 million in 2009. The effect of higher net earnings on
cash flow was partially offset by use of cash for increases in working capital items, including increases in accounts receivable of $23 million and inventory of $33 million. Higher provisions for incentives increased accruals for salaries and
incentives by $20 million in 2010, with payment in 2011.  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities. During 2011, cash was used to
fund $24 million of additions to property, plant and equipment. During 2010, cash was used to fund $17 million of additions to property, plant and equipment.  Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities. During 2011, cash provided by financing activities was $160 million. We entered into note agreements totaling $300 million, using proceeds to
repay outstanding amounts on lines of credit. Cash dividends paid totaled $51 million, an increase of $3 million from the prior year and share repurchases totaled $43 million. During 2010, $77 million was used in financing activities, with $48
million of cash dividends and share repurchases of $24 million.  In September 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase
up to 6 million shares of its outstanding stock, primarily through open-market transactions. This authorization will expire on September 30, 2012 and 4 million shares remain available under this authorization as of December 30,
2011. The Company may make opportunistic share repurchases in the future.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations. As of December 30, 2011, the Company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its long-term debt, operating leases and purchase obligations in the amounts listed below. The Company has no significant
off-balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations other than the items noted in the following table. In addition to the commitments noted in the following table, the Company could be obligated to perform under standby letters of credit totaling
$2 million at December 30, 2011. The Company has also guaranteed the debt of its subsidiaries up to $30 million. All debt of subsidiaries is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets.

 The amounts and
timing of future Company contributions to the funded qualified defined benefit pension plan are unknown because they are dependent on pension fund asset performance. The Company is considering a cash contribution to the funded plan of up to $20
million in 2012.  Critical Accounting Estimates  The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Companys most
significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts will differ from those estimates. The Company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the Companys
consolidated financial statements.  Excess and Discontinued Inventory. The Companys inventories are valued at the lower of
cost or market. Reserves for excess and discontinued products are estimated. The amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information, plans for discontinued products and other factors. Though management considers these balances
adequate, changes in sales volumes due to unanticipated economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company performs impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the asset might be impaired. For goodwill, the Company performs impairment reviews for the Companys reporting units, which have been determined to be the Companys divisions using a fair-value method based on
managements judgments and assumptions. The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units by an allocation of market capitalization value, cross-checked by a present value of future cash flows calculation. The estimated fair value is
then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. The Company also performs a separate impairment test for each other intangible asset with indefinite life, based on estimated future use and discounting
estimated future cash flows. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. Though management considers its judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, changes in product offerings or
marketing strategies could change the estimated fair values and result in impairment charges.  Product Warranty. A liability is
established for estimated warranty claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales. The Company estimates these costs based on historical claim experience, changes in warranty programs and other factors, including
evaluating specific product warranty issues. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues. Though management considers these balances adequate, changes in
the Companys warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item.  Income Taxes. In the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements, management calculates income taxes. This includes estimating current tax liability as well as
assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the balance sheet using statutory rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. These assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income. A valuation
allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal, state and international issues. The Company
routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that liabilities are properly stated. Valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes, changes in statutory rates, the Companys
future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits.  Retirement Obligations. The measurements of the Companys
pension and postretirement medical obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future payments, taking into consideration future events such as salary increase and demographic
experience. These assumptions may have an impact on the expense and timing of future contributions.  The assumptions used in developing the
required estimates for pension obligations include discount rate, inflation, salary increases, retirement rates, expected return on plan assets and mortality rates. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates for postretirement medical
obligations include discount rates, rate of future increase in medical costs and participation rates.  For U.S. plans, the Company establishes
its discount rate assumption by reference to a yield curve published by an actuary and projected plan cash flows. For plans outside the U.S., the Company establishes a rate by country by reference to highly rated corporate bonds. These reference
points have been determined to adequately match expected plan cash flows. The Company bases its inflation assumption on an evaluation of external market indicators. The salary assumptions are based on actual historical experience,

  24 


Table of Contents

the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement rates are based on experience. The investment return assumption is based on the expected long-term performance of plan assets. In setting
this number, the Company considers the input of actuaries and investment advisors, its long-term historical returns, the allocation of plan assets and projected returns on plan assets. The Company maintained its investment return assumption at 8.5
percent for 2012. Mortality rates are based on a common group mortality table for males and females.  Net pension cost in 2011 was $8 million
and was allocated to cost of products sold and operating expenses based on salaries and wages. At December 30, 2011, a one-half percentage point decrease in the indicated assumptions would have the following effects (in millions):

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued several Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that will be effective for the Company in 2012. New guidance on fair value measurements (ASU 2011-04)
and on presentation of other comprehensive income (ASU 2011-05) will not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  The Company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and pays variable interest rates on borrowings under certain credit facilities. Consequently, the Company is
subject to profitability risk arising from exchange and interest rate movements. The Company may use a variety of financial and derivative instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company does not enter into any of these
instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue. Rather, the Companys objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
 The Company may use forward exchange contracts, options and other hedging activities to hedge the U.S. dollar value resulting from
anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions. At December 30, 2011, the currencies to which the Company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the euro, Canadian dollar, British
pound, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan renminbi and South Korean won. It is not possible to determine the true impact of currency rate changes; however, the direct translation effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated. When
compared to 2010 results, the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar compared to other currencies resulted in an overall improvement in profitability. In 2011, the calculated translation effect resulted in an increase in net sales and net earnings of
approximately $17 million and $7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro was largely offset by strengthening of Asian currencies and for the year ended
December 31, 2010, the calculated impact of currency translation resulted in an increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately $3 million and $2 million, respectively.  2012 Outlook  We are planning for growth in all business segments and geographies in 2012,
although growth percentage trends will likely be lower, reflecting difficult comparisons to our record-level sales in 2011, continued challenges in the worldwide construction market and the ongoing Eurozone crisis. We will continue to invest in new
products and resources to expand our geographic footprint and broaden the served markets and applications for our products. While we remain cautious regarding demand trends in Western Europe, we continue to see strong growth in the emerging markets
of Europe as well as indications of strength in certain end-markets, such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and industrial lubrication. We see sustained opportunity to grow in the United States and in Asia Pacific. We are well positioned for
continued improvement in our operating results with organic growth. Our strong operating cash flows and capital structure enable us to pursue our strategic objectives.  We plan to pursue approval for our proposed acquisition of the ITW finishing businesses in 2012 and continue to have a strong interest in other acquisitions and growth initiatives that can leverage our
core strengths and operating skills.  The Companys backlog is typically small compared to annual sales and is not a good indicator of
future business levels. In addition to economic growth, the successful launch of new products and expanded distribution coverage, the sales outlook is dependent on many factors, including realization of price increases and stable foreign currency
exchange rates.

Forward-Looking Statements  A forward-looking statement is any statement made in this report and other reports that the Company files periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in press or earnings
releases, analyst briefings, conference calls and the Companys 2011 Overview report, which reflects the Companys current thinking on market trends and the Companys future financial performance at the time they are made. All
forecasts and projections are forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements in light of new information or future events.  The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 by making cautionary statements concerning any forward-looking
statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company cannot give any assurance that the results forecasted in any forward-looking statement will actually be achieved. Future results could differ materially from those expressed, due to the
impact of changes in various factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the United States and other major world economies, currency fluctuations, political instability, changes in laws and regulations, and
changes in product demand. In addition, risk factors related to the Companys proposed acquisition of the ITW finishing businesses include: whether and when the required regulatory approvals will be obtained, whether and when the closing
conditions will be satisfied and whether and when the transaction will close, the ability to close on committed financing on satisfactory terms, the amount of debt that the Company will incur to complete the transaction, completion of purchase price
valuation for acquired assets, whether and when the Company will be able to realize the expected financial results and accretive effect of the transaction, how customers, competitors, suppliers and employees will react to the transaction, and
economic changes in global markets. Please refer to Item 1A of, and Exhibit 99 to, this Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2011 for a more comprehensive discussion of these and other risk factors. 
Investors should realize that factors other than those identified above and in Item 1A and Exhibit 99 might prove important to the Companys
future results. It is not possible for management to identify each and every factor that may have an impact on the Companys operations in the future as new factors can develop from time to time.

 Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed
to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2011. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 30, 2011. 
The Companys independent auditors have issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. That report
appears in this Form 10-K.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of  Graco Inc. 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2011,
based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 30, 2011, of the Company and our report
dated February 21, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

Consolidated Financial Statements  To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of  Graco Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2011 and
December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2011. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries  Years Ended December 30, 2011, December 31,
2010 and December 25, 2009 
A. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) is 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the last
Friday in December. The year ended December 31, 2010, was a 53-week year. Years ended December 30, 2011 and December 25, 2009, were 52-week years.  Basis of Statement Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all significant
intercompany balances and transactions. As of December 30, 2011, all subsidiaries are 100 percent owned.  Foreign Currency
Translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of foreign currency balances and transactions of those subsidiaries are included in other
expense, net.  Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and
assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash Equivalents. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. 
Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method is used for
valuing most U.S. inventories. Inventories of foreign subsidiaries are valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Other
Current Assets. Amounts included in other current assets were (in thousands):

 The Company paid $1.5 million in 2011 for contracts insuring the lives of certain employees who are eligible to
participate in certain non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans. These insurance contracts will be used to fund the non-qualified pension and deferred compensation arrangements. The insurance contracts are held in a trust and are
available to general creditors in the event of the Companys insolvency. Changes in cash surrender value are recorded in operating expense and were not significant in 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
Capitalized software is amortized over its estimated useful life (generally 2 to 5 years) beginning at date of implementation. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company evaluates long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible
assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are also reviewed for impairment annually
in the fourth quarter. There were no significant write-downs of any long-lived assets in the periods presented.

 Self-Insurance. The Company is self-insured for certain losses and costs relating to product liability,
workers compensation and employee medical benefits claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims. Accrued self-insured retentions are based on claims filed and estimates of claims
incurred but not reported.  Product Warranties. A liability is established for estimated future warranty and service
claims that relate to current and prior period sales. The Company estimates warranty costs based on historical claim experience and other factors including evaluating specific product warranty issues. Following is a summary of activity in accrued
warranty and service liabilities (in thousands):

 Revenue Recognition. Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been
earned. The Companys policy is to recognize revenue when risk and title passes to the customer. This is generally on the date of shipment, however certain sales have terms requiring recognition when received by the customer. In cases where
there are specific customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized at the later of customer acceptance or shipment (subject to shipping terms). Payment terms are established based on the type of product, distributor capabilities and
competitive market conditions. Rights of return are typically contractually limited, amounts are estimable, and the Company records provisions for anticipated returns and warranty claims at the time revenue is recognized. Historically, sales returns
have been approximately 2 percent of sales. Provisions for sales returns are recorded as a reduction of net sales, and provisions for warranty claims are recorded in selling, marketing and distribution expenses. From time to time, the Company may
promote the sale of new products by agreeing to accept returns of superseded products. In such cases, provisions for estimated returns are recorded as a reduction of net sales.  Trade promotions are offered to distributors and end users through various programs, generally with terms of one year or less. Such promotions include cooperative advertising arrangements, rebates based
on annual purchases, coupons and reimbursement for competitive products. Payment of incentives may take the form of cash, trade credit, promotional merchandise or free product. Under cooperative advertising arrangements, the Company reimburses the
distributor for a portion of its advertising costs related to the Companys products; estimated costs are accrued at the time of sale and classified as selling, marketing and distribution expense. Rebates are accrued based on the program rates
and progress toward the estimated annual sales amount, and are recorded as a reduction of sales (cash, trade credit) or cost of products sold (free goods). The estimated costs related to coupon programs are accrued at the time of sale and classified
as selling, marketing and distribution expense or cost of products sold, depending on the type of incentive offered.  Earnings Per
Common Share. Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per share is computed after giving
effect to the exercise of all dilutive outstanding option grants.  Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income is a measure of
all changes in shareholders equity except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners, and includes such items as net earnings, certain foreign currency translation items, changes in the value of qualifying hedges and
pension liability adjustments.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company accounts for all
derivatives, including those embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities and measures those financial instruments at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on their intended use and
designation.  As part of its risk management program, the Company may periodically use forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to
manage known market exposures. Terms of derivative instruments are structured to match the terms of the risk being managed and are generally held to maturity. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. The Companys policy is to not enter into contracts with terms that cannot
be designated as normal purchases or sales.  In 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the rates
paid on a total of $80 million of variable rate borrowings. One contract fixed the rate on $40 million of borrowings at 4.7 percent plus the applicable spread (depending on cash flow leverage ratio) until December 2010. The second contract fixed an
additional $40 million of borrowings at 4.6 percent plus the applicable spread until January 2011. Both contracts were designated as cash flow hedges against interest rate volatility. Consequently, changes in the fair market value were recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Amounts included in AOCI were reclassified to earnings as interest rates varied and as the swap contracts approached expiration dates. Net amounts paid or payable under terms of the contracts
were charged to interest expense and totaled $0.1 million in 2011 and $3.5 million in 2010.  The Company periodically evaluates its monetary
asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company enters into forward contracts or options, or borrows in various currencies, in order to hedge its net monetary positions. These instruments are recorded at current market
values and the gains and losses are included in other expense, net. The notional amounts of contracts outstanding as of December 30, 2011 totaled $20 million. The Company believes it uses strong financial counterparts in these transactions and
that the resulting credit risk under these hedging strategies is not significant.  The Company uses significant other observable inputs to
value the derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate volatility and net monetary positions, including reference to market prices and financial models that incorporate relevant market assumptions. The fair market value and balance sheet
classification of such instruments follows (in thousands):

 The Company may periodically hedge other anticipated transactions, generally with forward exchange contracts, which are
designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses representing effective hedges are initially recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. There were
no gains or losses on such transactions in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and there were no such transactions outstanding as of December 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued several Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that will be effective for the Company in 2012. New
guidance on fair value measurements (ASU 2011-04) and on presentation of other comprehensive income (ASU 2011-05) will not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
B. Segment Information 
The Company has three reportable segments: Industrial, Contractor and Lubrication. The Industrial segment markets equipment and
pre-engineered packages for moving and applying paints, coatings, sealants, adhesives and other fluids. Markets served include automotive and truck assembly and components plants, wood products, rail, marine, aerospace, farm, construction, bus,
recreational vehicles, and various other industries. The Contractor segment markets sprayers for architectural coatings for painting, corrosion control, texture, and line striping. The Lubrication segment markets products to move and dispense
lubricants for fast oil change

facilities, service garages, fleet service centers, automobile dealerships, the mining industry and industrial lubrication applications. All segments market parts and accessories for their
products.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The cost
of manufacturing for each segment is based on product cost, and expenses are based on actual costs incurred along with cost allocations of shared and centralized functions based on activities performed, sales or space utilization. The Company began
identifying or allocating certain assets to segments in 2010. Depreciation expense is charged to the manufacturing or operating cost center that utilizes the asset, and is then allocated to segments on the same basis as other expenses within that
cost center.  Reportable segments are defined by product. Segments are responsible for development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of
their products. This allows for focused marketing and efficient product development. The segments share common purchasing, certain manufacturing, distribution and administration functions.

 Inventories valued under the LIFO method were $72.6 million for 2011 and $63.3 million for 2010. All other inventory was
valued on the FIFO method.  Certain inventory quantities were reduced in 2009, resulting in liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried
at lower costs from prior years. The effect on net earnings was not significant.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.  The Company records penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Total reserves for uncertain tax positions were not material. 
F. Debt 
In March 2011, the Company entered into a note agreement and sold $150 million of unsecured notes (series A and B) in a private
placement. In July 2011, the Company sold an additional $150 million in unsecured notes (series C and D). Proceeds were used to repay revolving line of credit borrowings and invested in cash and cash equivalents, mostly money market funds (carried
at cost, which approximates market value).  Interest rates and maturity dates on the four series of notes are as follows (dollars in
thousands):

 The notes have a carrying amount of $300 million and an estimated fair value of $320 million as of December 30,
2011. Estimated fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows and rates that would be available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.  In July 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing an unsecured credit facility for 5 years. This credit facility provides $250 million of committed credit,
available for general corporate purposes, working capital needs, share repurchases and acquisitions. The Company may borrow up to $25 million under the swingline portion of the facility for daily working capital needs. Borrowings under the facility
bear interest at either the banks prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent or the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of between 0.23 percent and 0.57 percent, depending on the Companys cash flow leverage ratio (debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). There were no borrowings against the facility as of December 30, 2011. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings against the credit facility was 0.5 percent as of
December 31, 2010. The Company is also required to pay a facility fee on the full amount of the loan commitment at an annual rate ranging from 0.07 percent to 0.15 percent, depending on the Companys cash flow leverage ratio. The agreement
requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as to cash flow leverage and interest coverage.  On December 30, 2011, the
Company had $269 million in lines of credit, including the $250 million in committed credit facilities described above and $19 million with foreign banks. The unused portion of committed credit lines was $264 million as of December 30, 2011. In
addition, the Company has unused, uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks totaling $10 million. Borrowing rates under these credit lines vary with the prime rate, rates on domestic certificates of deposit and the London Interbank market. The
weighted average cost of borrowing (including the effect of interest rate swaps) was 4.4 percent, 4.6 percent and 3.3 percent for the years ended December 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and December 25, 2009. The Company pays
facility fees of up to 0.15 percent per annum on certain of these lines. No compensating balances are required.  Various debt agreements
require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as to cash flow leverage and interest coverage. The Company has received from its credit facility lenders a waiver with respect to compliance with certain aspects of a covenant requiring
minimum pension funding levels. The Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants of its debt agreements.  Interest paid on debt
during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $ 8.7 million, $4.4 million and $4.8 million.

G. Shareholders Equity 
At December 30, 2011, the Company had 22,549 authorized, but not issued, cumulative preferred shares, $100 par value. The Company
also has authorized, but not issued, a separate class of 3 million shares of preferred stock, $1 par value.  The Company maintains a plan
in which one preferred share purchase right (Right) exists for each common share of the Company. Each Right will entitle its holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock at an exercise
price of $150, subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Rights expire in March 2020 and may be redeemed
earlier by the Board of Directors for $.001 per Right.  Components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were (in thousands):

H. Share-Based Awards, Purchase Plans and Compensation Cost 
Stock Option and Award Plan. The Company has a stock incentive plan under which it grants stock options and share awards
to directors, officers and other employees. Option price is the market price on the date of grant. Options become exercisable at such time, generally over three or four years, and in such installments as set by the Company, and expire ten years from
the date of grant.  Restricted share awards have been made to certain key employees under the plan. The market value of restricted stock at
the date of grant is charged to operations over the vesting period. Compensation cost charged to operations for restricted share awards was $291,000 in 2011, $263,000 in 2010 and $287,000 in 2009. Individual nonemployee directors of the Company may
elect to receive, either currently or deferred, all or part of their annual retainer, and/or payment for attendance at Board or Committee meetings, in the form of shares of the Companys common stock instead of cash. Under this arrangement, the
Company issued 8,190 shares in 2011, 10,104 shares in 2010 and 14,952 shares in 2009. The expense related to this arrangement is not significant. The Company has a stock appreciation plan that provides for payments of cash to eligible foreign
employees based on the change in the market price of the Companys common stock over a period of time. Compensation cost related to this plan was $851,000 in 2011.  Options on common shares granted and outstanding, as well as the weighted average exercise price, are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 Expected life is estimated based on vesting terms and exercise and termination history. Interest rate is based on the U.S
Treasury rate on zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the expected life of options. 
The fair value of employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was estimated on the date of grant. The benefit of the 15
percent discount from the lesser of the fair market value per common share on the first day and the last day of the plan year was added to the fair value of the employees purchase rights determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model

J. Retirement Benefits 
The Company has a defined contribution plan, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides retirement
benefits to most U.S. employees. For all employees who choose to participate, the Company matches employee contributions at a 100 percent rate, up to 3 percent of the employees compensation. For employees not covered by a defined benefit plan,
the Company contributes an amount equal to 1.5 percent of the employees compensation. Employer contributions totaled $4.2 million in 2011, $3.7 million in 2010 and $2.7 million in 2009.  The Companys postretirement medical plan provides certain medical benefits for retired U.S. employees. Employees hired before January 1, 2005, are eligible for these benefits upon retirement
and fulfillment of other eligibility requirements as specified by the plan.  The Company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans that together cover most U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2006, certain directors and some of the employees of the Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries. For U.S. plans,

benefits are based on years of service and the highest five consecutive years earnings in the ten years preceding retirement. The Company funds annually in amounts consistent with minimum
funding levels and maximum tax deduction limits.  Investment policies and strategies of the funded pension plan are based on a long-term view
of economic growth and heavily weighted toward equity securities. The primary goal of the plans investments is to ensure that the plans liabilities are met over time. In developing strategic asset allocation guidelines, an emphasis is
placed on the long-term characteristics of individual asset classes, and the benefits of diversification among multiple asset classes. The plan invests primarily in common stocks and bonds, including the Companys common stock. The midpoints of
the ranges of strategic target allocations for plan assets are 55 percent equity securities, 25 percent fixed income securities and 20 percent real estate and alternative investments.  Plan assets are held in a trust for the benefit of plan participants and are invested in various commingled funds, most of which are sponsored by the trustee. Plan assets are classified within the fair
value hierarchy as follows:  Level 1  based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
Level 2  based on significant observable inputs  Level 3  based on significant unobservable inputs  Even though the underlying assets held
in the trustee-sponsored equity funds are classified by the trustee as level 1, the plan classifies those funds as level 2 because the unit of fund measurement is defined as its net asset value, which is not directly traded on an active exchange.
Certain trustee-sponsored funds allow redemptions monthly or quarterly, with 10 or 60 days advance notice, while most of the funds allow redemptions daily.  Level 3 assets consist of investments in real estate investment trust funds whose assets are valued at least annually by independent appraisal firms, using market, income and cost approaches. 
Plan assets by category and fair value measurement level were as follows (in thousands):

 Several sources of information are considered in determining the expected rate of return assumption, including the
allocation of plan assets, the input of actuaries and professional investment advisors, and historical long-term returns. In setting the return assumption, the Company recognizes that historical returns are not always indicative of future returns
and also considers the long-term nature of its pension obligations.  The Companys U.S. retirement medical plan limits the annual cost
increase that will be paid by the Company to 3 percent. In measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), the annual trend rate for health care costs was assumed to be 8.2 percent for 2012, decreasing each year to a constant
rate of 4.5 percent for 2026 and thereafter, subject to the plans annual increase limitation.  At December 30, 2011, a one percent
change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a significant impact on the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement health care benefit cost or the APBO for health care benefits. 
The Company expects to contribute $0.8 million to its unfunded pension plans and $1.5 million to the postretirement medical plan in 2012. The Company
expects that contributions to the funded pension plan under minimum funding requirements for 2012 will not exceed $10 million, and that the amounts payable in 2012 may be reduced by $7 million in available credits. Estimated future benefit payments
are as follows (in thousands):

Other Commitments. The Company is committed to pay suppliers under the terms of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of
business totaling approximately $45 million at December 30, 2011. The Company also has commitments with certain suppliers to purchase minimum quantities, and under the terms of certain agreements, the Company is committed for certain portions
of the suppliers inventory. The Company does not purchase, or commit to purchase, quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts

that cannot be used within one year. The Company estimates that the maximum commitment amount under such agreements does not exceed $17 million. In addition, the Company could be obligated to
perform under standby letters of credit totaling $2 million at December 30, 2011. The Company has also guaranteed the debt of its subsidiaries for up to $30 million. All debt of subsidiaries is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets.
 Contingencies. The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company is
actively pursuing and defending these matters and has recorded an estimate of the probable costs. Management does not expect that resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company, although the ultimate outcome cannot be
determined based on available information. 
L. Acquisitions 
In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the finishing businesses of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW)
in a $650 million cash transaction. The purchase agreement allows for termination by either party after April 1, 2012. The Company plans to finance the acquisition through a new committed $450 million revolving credit facility that will be funded
upon closing of the purchase, and funds available under the long-term notes referenced above, in Note F. Closing of the purchase is subject to regulatory reviews and other customary closing conditions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an
administrative complaint and commenced a civil lawsuit in United States District Court, seeking to stop the acquisition. The Company continues to have discussions with ITW and with the FTC regarding possible resolution. 
Also in April 2011, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Eccentric Pumps, LLC (Eccentric) for approximately
$2.1 million cash. Eccentric was engaged in the business of designing and selling peristaltic hose pumps for metering, dosing and transferring fluids. The Company expects to employ the Eccentric assets to expand and complement its Industrial segment
business. The purchase price was allocated based on estimated fair values, including $1.7 million of goodwill and $0.7 million of other identifiable intangible assets.
