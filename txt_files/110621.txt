PART I 
Item 1.    Business.  THE COMPANY  RPM International Inc., a Delaware corporation, succeeded to
the reporting obligations of RPM, Inc., an Ohio corporation, following a 2002 reincorporation transaction. RPM, Inc. was incorporated in 1947 under the name Republic Powdered Metals, Inc. and changed its name to RPM, Inc. in 1971. In connection with
the 2002 reincorporation from Ohio to Delaware, we established a new legal structure, which included the formation of two new, wholly owned subsidiaries of RPM International Inc., the RPM Consumer Holding Company and the RPM Industrial Holding
Company. These two holding companies, in addition to RPM, Inc., which remained as one of our subsidiaries following the reincorporation, own the various operating companies and other legal entities that make up RPM International Inc. In 2010, RPM,
Inc. changed its name to Specialty Products Holding Corp (SPHC). At the end of fiscal 2010, SPHC and its Bondex International, Inc. (Bondex) subsidiary filed voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, as a result of which we
have deconsolidated SPHC and its subsidiaries from our financial results. See Item 3  Legal Proceedings and Notes A(2), F and N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
As used herein, the terms RPM, the Company, we, our and us refer to RPM
International Inc. and all of our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 2628 Pearl Road, P.O. Box 777, Medina, Ohio 44258, and our telephone number is
(330) 273-5090.  BUSINESS 
Our subsidiaries manufacture, market and sell various specialty chemical product lines, including high-quality specialty paints,
protective coatings, roofing systems, sealants and adhesives, focusing on the maintenance and improvement needs of both the industrial and consumer markets. Our family of products includes those marketed under brand names such as API, Carboline,
DAP, Dri-Eaz, EUCO, Fibergrate, Flecto, Flowcrete, Grupo PV, Hummervoll, Universal Sealants, illbruck, Rust-Oleum, Stonhard, Tremco, Watco and Zinsser. As of May 31, 2012, our subsidiaries marketed products in approximately 150 countries and
territories and operated manufacturing facilities in approximately 82 locations in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Norway, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Approximately 43% of our sales are generated in international markets through a combination of exports and direct sales in foreign countries. For the fiscal year ended May 31,
2012, we recorded net sales of $3.8 billion.  Available Information 
Our Internet website address is www.rpminc.com. We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Segment Information  Our business is divided into two reportable segments: the industrial reportable segment (industrial segment) and the consumer reportable segment (consumer segment). Within each
reportable segment, we aggregate several operating segments which comprise individual reporting units and product lines that generally address common markets, utilize similar technologies and are able to share manufacturing or distribution
capabilities. The industrial segment (RPM Building Solutions Group, RPM Performance Coatings Group and RPM2 Group), which comprises approximately 67% of our total net sales, includes maintenance and protection products for roofing and waterproofing
systems, flooring, corrosion control and other specialty applications. The consumer segment (Rust-Oleum Group and DAP Group) comprises approximately 33% of our total net sales and includes rust-preventative, special purpose and decorative paints,
caulks, sealants, primers and other branded

in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, which appears in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Competition  We conduct
our business in highly competitive markets, and all of our major products face competition from local, regional and national firms. Our markets, however, are fragmented, and we do not face competition across all of our products from any one
competitor in particular. Several of our competitors have access to greater financial resources and larger sales organizations than we do. While third-party figures are not necessarily available with respect to the size of our position in the market
for each of our products, we believe that we are a major producer of caulks, sealants, patch-and-repair products for the general consumer as well as for the residential building trade; roofing systems; urethane sealants and waterproofing materials;
aluminum coatings; cement-based paints; hobby paints; industrial-corrosion-control products; fireproofing; consumer rust-preventative coatings; polymer floorings; fluorescent coatings and pigments; fiberglass-reinforced-plastic gratings; and
shellac-based coatings. However, we do not believe that we have a significant share of the total protective coatings market (on a world-wide basis). The following is a summary of the competition that our key products face in the various markets in
which we compete:  Paints, Coatings, Adhesives and Sealants Products 
The market for paints, coatings, adhesives and sealants has experienced significant consolidation over the past several decades. However,
the market remains fragmented, which creates further consolidation opportunities for industry participants. Many leading suppliers tend to focus on coatings, while other companies focus on adhesives and sealants. Barriers to market entry are
relatively high for new market entrants due to the lengthy intervals between product development and market acceptance, the importance of brand identity and the difficulty in establishing a reputation as a reliable supplier of these products. Most
of the suppliers, including us, who provide these items have a portfolio of products that span across a wide variety of applications.  Consumer Home Improvement Products.    Within the consumer segment, we generally serve the home improvement market with products designed for niche architectural,
rust-preventative, decorative, special purpose, caulking and sealing applications. The products we sell for home improvement include those sold under our DAP, Phenoseal, Rust-Oleum, Watco and Zinsser brand names. Leading manufacturers of home
improvement-related coatings, adhesives and sealants market their products to DIY users and contractors through a wide range of distribution channels. These distribution channels include direct sales to home improvement centers, mass merchandisers,
hardware and paint stores, and sales through distributors and sales representative organizations. Competitors in this market generally compete for market share by marketing and building upon brand recognition, providing customer service and
developing new products based on customer needs.  Industrial Protective Coatings
Products.    Anti-corrosion protective coatings and fireproofing must withstand the destructive elements of nature and operating processes under harsh environments and conditions. Some of the larger consumers of
high-performance protective and corrosion control coatings and fireproofing are the oil and gas, pulp and paper, petrochemical, shipbuilding, public utility and bridge and highway industries. In the public sector, corrosion control coatings are used
on structures such as bridges and in water and wastewater treatment plants. These markets are highly fragmented. We and our competitors compete for market share by supplying a wide variety of high-quality products and by offering customized
solutions. Our industrial coating products are marketed primarily under our Carboline, Plasite, Nullifire, A/D Fire, Thermo-lag, Perlifoc and Epoplex brand names.  Roofing Systems Products  In the roofing industry, re-roofing
applications have historically accounted for three-quarters of U.S. demand, with the remaining quarter generated by new roofing applications. The largest manufacturers of roofing systems products focus primarily on residential roofing as well
as single-ply systems for low-end, commercial and institutional applications, competing mainly on price and, to a lesser degree, service. In contrast, 
  6 


Table of Contents

we compete primarily for the higher-end, multi-ply and modified bitumen applications in the built-up and low-slope roofing industry. This specialty niche within the larger market tends to exhibit
fewer commodity-market characteristics, with customers valuing the greater protection and longer life provided by these roofing systems, as well as ongoing maintenance, inspection and technical services. We are also very active in the growing market
of sustainable roofing systems. Typical customers demanding higher-performance roofing systems include governmental facilities, universities, schools, hospitals, museums and certain manufacturing facilities. Our roofing systems are primarily
marketed under our Tremco brand.  Construction Chemical Products 
Flooring Systems Products.    Polymer flooring systems are used in industrial, commercial and, to a lesser
extent, residential applications to provide a smooth, seamless surface that is impervious to penetration by water and other substances while being easy to clean and maintain. These systems are particularly well-suited for clean environments such as
pharmaceutical, food and beverage and healthcare facilities. In addition, the fast installation time and long-term durability of these systems and products make them ideal for industrial floor repair and restoration. Polymer flooring systems are
based on epoxy polyurethane and methylmethacrylate resins. Most of these flooring systems are applied during new construction, but there is also a significant repair and renovation market. Key performance attributes in polymer flooring systems that
distinguish competitors for these applications include static control, chemical resistance, contamination control, durability and aesthetics. We market our flooring systems under the Stonhard, Flowcrete and Hummervoll and API brand names.
 FRP Grating and Structural Composites.    Fiberglass reinforced plastic grating, or FRP, is used
primarily in industrial and, to a lesser extent, commercial applications. FRP grating exhibits many specialized features, which make it a beneficial alternative to traditional steel or aluminum grating. These include a high strength-to-weight ratio,
high corrosion resistance, electrical and thermal non-conductivity, and molded-in color, which eliminates the need for repainting. FRP grating is used for platforms, walkways, stairs and structures for a variety of applications, including those in
the food and beverage, chemical processing, water-wastewater, pulp and paper, and offshore oil and gas industries. Other structural composites include trench drains, channel drains, curbing and structural members. Key attributes that differentiate
competitors in these markets include product quality, depth of product line, and design-and-fabrication services. Our products for these applications are sold under our Fibergrate, Chemgrate, Corgrate, Safe-T-Span, EnviroKerb, EnviroChannel,
EnviroDeck and EnviroGrate brand names.  Sealants, Waterproofing, Concrete and Masonry
Products.    Sealants, which are used primarily for commercial buildings, include urethane, silicone, latex, butyl and hybrid technology products, and are designed to be installed in construction joints for the purpose of
providing an air and water-tight seal. Waterproof coatings, usually urethane based, are installed in exposed and buried applications to waterproof and protect concrete. Structural and traffic bearing membranes are used in a variety of applications
for bridge deck construction and restoration and the protection and preservation of parking structures. In the concrete and masonry additives market, a variety of chemicals and fibers can be added to concrete and masonry to improve the
processability, performance, or appearance of these products. Chemical concrete admixtures are typically grouped according to their functional characteristics, such as water-reducers, set controllers, superplasticizers and air-entraining agents. The
key attributes that differentiate competitors for these applications include quality assurance, on-the-job consultation and value-added, highly engineered products. We primarily offer products marketed under our Tremco, EUCO, illbruck, Tamms,
Republic, Vulkem, Dymeric, Increte, Tuff-N-Dri, Nufins, StructureCare, BridgeCare, Pitchmastic, Watchdog Waterproofing, PSI, Tuf-Strand and Enviro-Dri brand names for this line of business.  Intellectual Property  Our intellectual property
portfolios include valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks, trade and brand names. In addition, through our subsidiaries, we continue to conduct significant research and technology development activities. Among our
most significant intangibles are our Rust-Oleum®, Carboline®, DAP®, illbruck® and Tremco® trademarks.  Rust-Oleum
Brands Company and some of our other subsidiaries own more than 900 trademark registrations or applications in the United States and numerous other countries for the trademark Rust-Oleum®

and other trademarks covering a variety of rust-preventative, decorative, general purpose, specialty, industrial and professional coatings sold by Rust-Oleum Corporation and related companies.
 Carboline Company, and some of our other subsidiaries, own two United States trademark registrations for
the trademark Carboline®. Carboline Company and some of our other subsidiaries also own more than
250 other trademark registrations or applications in the United States and numerous other countries covering the products sold by the Carboline Company.  DAP Brands Company and other subsidiaries of the Company own more than 450 trademark registrations or applications in the United States and numerous other countries for the DAP® trademark, the Putty Knife design trademark and other trademarks covering products sold under the
DAP brand and related brands.  Tremco Incorporated and some of our other subsidiaries own more than 75
registrations for the trademark Tremco® in the United States and numerous countries covering a
variety of roofing, sealants and coating products. There are also many other trademarks of Tremco Incorporated that are the subject of registrations or application in the United States and numerous other countries, bringing the total number of
registrations and applications to more than 950.  Our other principal product trademarks include:
Alumanation®, B-I-N®, Bitumastic®, Bulls Eye 1-2-3®, Chemgrate®, Dymeric®, EUCO®, Flecto®, Fibergrate®, Floquil®, Geoflex®, illbruck®, Paraseal®, Permaroof®, Plasite®, Sanitile®, Stonblend®, Stonclad®, Stonhard®, Stonlux®, Testors®, Varathane®, Vulkem®, Woolsey®, Zinsser® and Z-Spar®; and, in Europe,
Flowcretetm, Nullifire®, Radglo® and Martin Mathystm. Our existing and pending trademark registrations are valid for a variety of different terms of up to 20 years, and may be renewable as long as the trademarks continue to be used and all other local
conditions for renewal are met. Our trademark registrations are maintained and renewed on a regular basis as required.  Raw Materials
 The sources and availability of the raw materials we use in our business continue to be adequate to meet our current and
projected needs. Over the past 12 months, the first 3 quarters saw a continuation of raw material costs steadily increasing due to increasing global demand, unusually high planned and unplanned raw material production shutdowns, certain
lower-than-normal global crop yields, escalating energy and related feedstock costs, continued weak U.S. dollar currency, increasing China export controls and tariffs, improved supplier pricing discipline, and decreasing natural gas costs relative
to the cost of oil, which has caused cracking optimization and, therefore, a reduction in the supply of certain materials. The latest quarter has seen raw material cost increases abate or cease, with some initial cost decreases. The primary cause is
globally weak material demand. On a long-term basis, we anticipate the costs of the raw materials we use will continue to be subject to upward pressure.  Seasonal Factors  Our business is dependent, to a significant extent, on
external weather factors. We historically experience stronger sales and net income in our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters, which are the three month periods ending August 31, November 30 and May 31, respectively, while we
have experienced weaker performance in our third fiscal quarter.  Customers 
Ten large consumer segment customers, such as DIY home centers, on a combined basis represented approximately 22%, 23%, and 22% of our
total net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Except for sales to these customers, our business is not dependent upon any one customer or small group of customers, but is largely dispersed over a
substantial number of customers.  Backlog  We historically have not had a significant backlog of orders, and we did not have a significant backlog at May 31, 2012.

Research and Development  Our research and development work is performed at various laboratory locations. During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, we spent approximately $45.4 million, $40.9 million and $41.3 million,
respectively, on research and development activities. In addition to this laboratory work, we view our field technical service as being integral to the success of our research activities. Our research and development activities and our field
technical service costs are both included as part of our selling, general and administrative expenses.  Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations dealing with environmental, health and safety issues for the
various locations around the world in which we conduct our business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following major areas:   


 

 
 the sale, export, generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; 
 


 

 
 the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, water and air; and

 the health and safety of our employees.  We are also required to obtain permits from various governmental authorities for certain operations. We cannot guarantee that our subsidiaries or their plants have been or will be at all times in complete
compliance with all such laws, regulations and permits. If we or any of our subsidiaries violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. 
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or
remediation of hazardous substances. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances also may be responsible for the cost of removal or remediation of these substances, even if such persons never owned or operated any
disposal or treatment facility. Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various environmental claims, proceedings and/or remedial activities relating to facilities currently or previously owned, operated or used by these subsidiaries, or their
predecessors. In addition, we or our subsidiaries, together with other parties, have been designated as potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste at certain disposal
sites. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state and local agencies, plaintiffs could raise personal injury, natural resource damage or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on a property. Environmental
laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of hazardous substances.  We have incurred in the past, and will continue to incur in the future, costs to comply with environmental laws. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become
increasingly stringent over time. In addition, the related costs may vary depending on the particular facts and development of new information. As a result, our operating expenses and continuing capital expenditures related to compliance with
environmental laws may increase, and more stringent standards also may limit our operating flexibility. A significant increase in these costs and capital expenditures could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or
cash flows. In addition, to the extent hazardous materials exist on or under our real property, the value and future use of that real property may be adversely affected. For information regarding environmental accruals, see Note O
(Contingencies and Loss Reserves) of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by reference. For more information concerning certain environmental matters
affecting us, see Item 3  Legal Proceedings  Environmental Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Employees  As of
May 31, 2012, we employed 9,713 persons, of whom 790 were represented by unions under contracts which expire at varying times in the future. We believe that all relations with employees and their unions are good.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained or incorporated by
reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us, our business and your investment in us.  The SPHC and Bondex
Chapter 11 proceedings involve various risks and uncertainties that could have a material effect on us.  There are a
number of issues and matters to be resolved in connection with the SPHC and Bondex Chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, the following:   


 

 
 the ultimate asbestos liability of the filing entities; 
 


 

 
 the outcome of negotiations with a committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and other participants in the Chapter 11 proceedings,
concerning, among other things, the size and structure of a trust to satisfy the asbestos liability and the means for funding that trust; and   


 

 
 the Bankruptcy Courts decisions relating to numerous substantive and procedural aspects of the Chapter 11 proceedings, including with regard
to the length of time the existing preliminary injunction that prohibits derivative asbestos liability lawsuits and other actions from being brought against RPM International and other non-filing affiliates of the filing entities remains in effect,
any shaping litigation regarding asbestos claims, and estimation of the aggregate asbestos liability of the filing entities.  The ability of the filing entities to successfully reorganize will depend on their ability to both reach an acceptable agreement with the asbestos claimants that satisfies all applicable legal
requirements and obtain the requisite court approvals, and we cannot ensure that these entities can successfully reorganize nor can we give any assurances as to the impact of any such reorganization on the financial condition, results of operations
or future prospects of the filing entities and their subsidiary businesses. We are also unable to predict the timing of any of the foregoing matters or the Chapter 11 proceedings themselves. 
As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, the filing entities are precluded from paying dividends to shareholders and making payments on
any pre-bankruptcy filing accounts or notes payable that are due and owing to any other entity within the RPM group of companies (the Pre-Petition Intercompany Payables) and other pre-petition creditors during the pendency of the Chapter
11 proceedings, without the Bankruptcy Courts approval. Moreover, no assurances can be given that any of the Pre-Petition Intercompany Payables will be paid or otherwise satisfied in connection with the confirmation of a SPHC plan of
reorganization. As of May 30, 2010, the day prior to the Chapter 11 filing, SPHC and its subsidiaries had Pre-Petition Intercompany Payables of approximately $209.6 million and pre-petition intercompany receivables from other entities
within the RPM group of companies (other than subsidiaries of SPHC) of approximately $87.3 million.  We also expect that
in the Chapter 11 proceedings, various claims may be asserted against RPM International, including allegations that we are liable for the asbestos-related liabilities of the filing entities. Although we believe we have no responsibility for
liabilities of the filing entities, we cannot assure you that the resolution of such claims, or the perception that RPM International may have a risk of exposure to liability for the asbestos-related liabilities of the filing entities, will not have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our securities. Moreover it is uncertain whether, and to what extent, we may have to contribute to an asbestos trust or whether any channeling
injunction entered in connection with a plan of reorganization will extend to all non-filing affiliates of the filing entities, including RPM International.  Our operations have been adversely affected by global market and economic conditions.  The late-2000s global recession had an adverse effect on our operating results. Both of our segments felt the impact of the global economic decline. Although we have seen our operations rebound since
then, our operations could be adversely affected by global economic conditions if global markets were to decline in the future. The late-2000s recession resulted, and future economic declines may result, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings
or growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collection of customer receivables. We also have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased competitive pricing pressure. In addition, customer difficulties have
resulted, and could result in the future, in increases in bad debt write-offs and adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.

Global economic and capital market conditions may cause our access to capital to be more difficult in the
future and/or costs to secure such capital more expensive.  We may need new or additional financing in the future to
provide liquidity to conduct our operations, expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. Any sustained weakness in general economic conditions and/or U.S. or global capital markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital
on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and we may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Our access to
funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they
experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our credit facility are several and not joint
and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term volatility and continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased
regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take
measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.  Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions. 
We sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans and various other nonqualified postretirement plans. The qualified defined benefit
pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can
(i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future contribution requirements. A significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or
a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations. A significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension
plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flow.  The results of our annual testing of goodwill and other intangible assets have
required, and in the future may require that we incur non-cash impairment charges.  As of May 31, 2012, we had
approximately $1.2 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) section 350 requires that goodwill be tested at least on an annual basis, or more frequently as impairment
indicators arise, using either a qualitative assessment or a fair-value approach at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual required impairment tests, which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the reporting
units with which goodwill is associated, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. The evaluation of our long-lived assets for impairment includes determining whether indicators of impairment exist, which is a subjective process that takes
into account both internal and external factors. Impairment assessment requires the use of significant judgment with regard to estimates and assumptions surrounding future results of operations and cash flows. For the fiscal years ended May 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, our impairment testing did not result in any impairment loss. In the future, if global economic conditions were to decline significantly, or if our reporting units experienced significant declines in business, we may incur
substantial non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. The amount of any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our significant amount of indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Our total debt levels were essentially unchanged at May 31, 2012 from $1.1 billion at May 31, 2011, which compares with $1.2 billion in stockholders equity at May 31, 2012.
Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:   


 

 
 require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash flow
available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, stock repurchases or other general corporate requirements; 
  11 


Table of Contents


 

 
 result in a downgrading of our credit rating, which would increase our borrowing costs, adversely affect our financial results, and make it more
difficult for us to raise capital;   


 

 
 restrict our operational flexibility and reduce our ability to conduct certain transactions, since our credit facility contains certain restrictive
financial and operating covenants;   


 

 
 limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions, which would make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic
conditions; and   


 

 
 have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity if large debt maturities occur in close succession. 
Fluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results. 
We obtain the raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Many of our raw materials are petroleum-based
derivatives, minerals and metals. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market and from a variety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate,
which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. The costs of the raw materials we use are under generally upward pressure due to escalating energy and related feedstock costs,
increased levels of global demand, improved levels of supplier pricing discipline and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar. If the prices of raw materials continue to increase and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers,
we could experience reduced gross profit margins.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our competitors are
much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do.  The markets in which we operate are
fragmented, and we do not face competition from any one company across all of our product lines. However, any significant increase in competition, as a result of the consolidation of competitors or otherwise, may cause us to lose market share or
compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced gross profit margins. Increased competition may also impair our ability to grow or to maintain our current levels of revenues and earnings. Companies that compete in our
markets include Akzo Nobel, Ferro, H.B. Fuller, Masco, PPG, Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. Several of these companies are much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do. Increased competition with these companies could
prevent the institution of price increases or could require price reductions or increased spending to maintain our market share, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.  We depend on a number of large customers for a significant portion of our net sales and, therefore, significant declines in the level of purchases by any of these key customers could harm our business.
 Some of our operating companies, particularly in the consumer segment, face a substantial amount of customer
concentration. Our key consumer segment customers include Ace Hardware, Cotter & Company, Do It Best, The Home Depot, Lowes, Menards, Orgill, Rona, Wal-Mart and W.W. Grainger. Sales to our ten largest consumer segment customers
accounted for approximately 22%, 23% and 22% of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 67%, 68% and 69%, respectively, of the consumer segments net sales for those same fiscal years.
If we were to lose one or more of our key customers, or experience a delay or cancellation of a significant order, or incur a significant decrease in the level of purchases from any of our key customers, or experience difficulty in collecting
amounts due from a key customer, our net revenues could decline and our operating results could be reduced materially.  Many of our
customers operate in cyclical industries, and downward economic cycles may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Many of our customers, across both reportable segments, are in businesses and industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to
changes in general economic conditions, interest rates, construction activity, and other 
  12 


Table of Contents

factors, including changes in consumer spending and preferences. As a result, the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, upon general economic conditions. Downward economic
cycles affecting the markets of our customers may reduce the sales of our products resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.  A loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products.  Our family of products includes a number of well-known brand names that are used in a variety of industrial maintenance, consumer DIY and professional applications. We believe that continuing to maintain
the strength of our brands is critical to increasing demand for our products and maintaining their widespread acceptance among our customers. The reputations of our branded products depend on numerous factors, including the successful advertising
and marketing of our brand names, consumer acceptance, the availability of similar products from our competitors, and our ability to maintain our products quality and technological advantages. A loss in the actual or perceived value of our
brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products.  Our business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are
unable to protect our material trademarks and other proprietary information.  We have numerous valuable patents, trade
secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names, including certain marks that are significant to our business, which are identified under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Despite our efforts to protect our
trademarks and other proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, other parties, including our former employees or consultants, may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our proprietary information or marks without our authorization.
Unauthorized use of our trademarks, or unauthorized use or disclosure of our other intellectual property, could negatively impact our business and financial condition.  The chemical and construction products industries in which we operate expose us to inherent risks of legal and warranty claims and other litigation-related costs, which could adversely impact our
business.  As a participant in the chemical and construction products industries, we face an inherent risk of exposure to
legal claims in the event that the failure, use or misuse of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Many of our industrial segment products are used in industrial, commercial or institutional building
construction projects. In some instances, our companies offer extended term warranties and as a result, from time to time we may experience higher levels of warranty expense, which is typically reflected in selling, general and administrative
expenses.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to unforeseen future expenditures or liabilities, which
could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the
U.S., Canada and other foreign countries where we conduct business. Governmental and regulatory authorities impose various laws and regulations on us that relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous
materials, and various health and safety matters, including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes, the use of certain chemicals in product formulations,
and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, and various other federal, state, provincial, local and
international statutes. In addition, these laws and regulations often impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up our or our predecessors past or present facilities and
third party disposal sites. We are currently undertaking remedial activities at a number of facilities and properties and have received notices under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA) or analogous state laws of liability or potential liability in connection with the disposal of material from our current or former operations. Further, we also could be subject to future liability resulting from conditions that
are currently unknown to us that could be discovered in the future. 
  13 


Table of Contents
The environmental laws under which we operate are numerous, complicated and often
increasingly stringent, and may be applied retroactively. As a result, we have not always been and may not always be in full compliance with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we conduct our
business. In addition, if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We also could be liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances relating to our
products or operations. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our businesses are subject to
extensive environmental and safety laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  Our businesses are dependent on the issuance of operating permits and registrations required from government agencies. In connection with the performance of certain activities, our businesses are required
to seek permission from agencies in the states, provinces, and countries in which they operate. If regulatory permits or registrations are delayed, restricted, or rejected, subsequent operations at our businesses could be delayed or restricted.
 Any regulatory agency could reject or delay the review of any of our business filings. Delays in obtaining necessary permits
and registrations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations or permit requirements could result in substantial civil or criminal fines and penalties or
enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations, remedial or corrective measures, installations of pollution control equipment, or other actions. This could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results.  If our efforts in acquiring and integrating other companies or product lines or
establishing joint ventures fail, our business may not grow.  As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue
pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and creating joint ventures. Our ability to continue to grow in this manner depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions or joint venture
arrangements. In addition, acquisitions and their subsequent integration involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:   


 

 
 inaccurate assessments of disclosed liabilities and the potentially adverse effects of undisclosed liabilities; 
 


 

 
 unforeseen difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, their products, and their culture into our existing business; 
 


 

 
 unforeseen delays in realizing the benefits from acquired companies or product lines, including projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies
and profit margins;   


 

 
 unforeseen diversion of our managements time and attention from other business matters; 
 


 

 
 unforeseen difficulties resulting from insufficient prior experience in any new markets we may enter; 
 


 

 
 unforeseen difficulties in retaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses; and 
 


 

 
 increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could in turn restrict our ability to raise additional capital when needed or to pursue
other important elements of our business strategy.  Execution of our acquisition strategy with respect to
some companies or product lines could fail or could result in unanticipated costs to us that were not apparent despite our due diligence efforts, either of which could hinder our growth or adversely impact our results of operations. 
Our credit facility contains restrictions on certain mergers and asset dispositions. 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from foreign markets, which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our
results of operations.  Our foreign manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 41% of our net trade sales for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2012, not including exports directly from the U.S. which accounted for approximately 2% of 
  14 


Table of Contents

our net trade sales for fiscal 2012. Our international operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, inflation rates, trade protection measures,
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, changing intellectual property rights, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of our products or
increase our costs. Also, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in material volatility in our costs and earnings and may also adversely affect the carrying values of our assets located
outside the U.S.  We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery
laws.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that
have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we have internal controls and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  We could be adversely affected by global tax
law changes.  Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations which
govern, among other things, taxes on worldwide income. Any potential tax law changes may, for example, increase applicable tax rates or impose stricter compliance requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could reduce our
consolidated net earnings.  In response to the recent economic crisis and the recent recession, governments may revise tax
laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly
changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. For example, most U.S. company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the United States is generally taxed at local rates, which are often
much lower than U.S. tax rates. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase, our profits could be reduced, and if such increases were a
result of our status as a U.S. company, could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.  Terrorist activities and other acts of violence or war and natural disasters have negatively impacted in the past and could negatively impact in the future the U.S. and foreign countries, the financial
markets, the industries in which we compete, our operations and profitability.  Terrorist activities and natural disasters
have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could affect the industries in which we compete, our ability to purchase raw materials, our results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, terrorist activities and natural disasters may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, which could impact our sales, our production capability and our ability
to deliver products to our customers. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we have insurance, it may not cover every potential
risk associated with our operations.  Although we maintain insurance of various types to cover many of the risks and
hazards that apply to our operations, our insurance may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.

Adverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative
effect on our sales.  From time to time, adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the U.S. and other countries
in which we do business have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint, coatings and related products. For example, unusually cold and rainy weather, especially during the general construction and exterior painting season, could have an adverse
effect on sales of our exterior paint products. As a result, we have historically experienced weaker sales and net income in our third fiscal quarter (December through February) in comparison to our performance during our other fiscal quarters.
 Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments. 
Not Applicable.  
Item 2.    Properties.   Our corporate headquarters and a plant and
offices for one subsidiary are located on a 119-acre site, which we own in Medina, Ohio. As of May 31, 2012, our operations occupied a total of approximately 10.2 million square feet, with the majority, approximately 8.1 million
square feet, devoted to manufacturing, assembly and storage. Of the approximately 10.2 million square feet occupied, approximately 5.3 million square feet are owned and approximately 4.9 million square feet are occupied under
operating leases.

We lease certain of our properties under long-term leases. Some of these leases provide for
increased rent based on an increase in the cost-of-living index. For information concerning our rental obligations, see Note K (Leases) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders
and is incorporated herein by reference. Under many of our leases, we are obligated to pay certain varying insurance costs, utilities, real property taxes and other costs and expenses. 
We believe that our manufacturing plants and office facilities are well maintained and suitable for our operations. 
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.  
Asbestos Litigation and the Bankruptcy Filings by SPHC and Bondex  On May 31, 2010, Bondex International, Inc. (Bondex) and its parent, Specialty Products Holding Corp. (SPHC), filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court) to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code). SPHC is the parent company of Bondex and also serves as the parent company for
various operating companies that are not part of the reorganization filing, including Chemical Specialties Manufacturing Corp., Day-Glo Color Corp., Dryvit Systems, Inc. through Dryvit Holdings, Inc., Guardian Protection Products Inc., Kop-Coat
Inc., TCI, Inc. and RPM Wood Finishes Group, Inc. (collectively with SPHC and Bondex, the Deconsolidated Group). SPHC and Bondex (the filing entities) took this action as a means to permanently and comprehensively resolve all
pending and future asbestos-related liability claims associated with Bondex and SPHC. As a result of the filing, all litigation related to Bondex and SPHC asbestos personal injury claims has been stayed, with the exception of the cases referred to
in Note A(2) to the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to which the stay was lifted. The Chapter 11 proceedings will enable the filing entities to establish a section 524(g) trust accompanied by a court order that will direct
all existing and future SPHC-related and Bondex-related claims to such trust, which will then compensate only meritorious claims at appropriate values. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for further information concerning the
effects of the Chapter 11 proceedings.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, when a subsidiary
whose financial statements were previously consolidated with those of its parent (as SPHCs were with ours) becomes subject to the control of a government, court, administrator or regulator (including filing for protection under the Bankruptcy
Code), whether solvent or insolvent, deconsolidation of that subsidiary is generally required. As discussed in Note A(2) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our investment in SPHC is recorded under the cost method effective May 31,
2010. The cost method requires us to present the net assets of SPHC at May 31, 2010, as an investment and not recognize any income or loss from SPHC in our results of operations during the reorganization period. Our net investment in SPHC is
carried at a zero value. When SPHC emerges from the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the applicable circumstances and facts at such time, including the terms of any plan of reorganization.
See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Environmental Proceedings 
In May 2012, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, a political subdivision of the State of California with responsibility for
air pollution control within Orange County and designated portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties (the District), entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Rust-Oleum Settlement Agreement) with
Rust-Oleum Corporation (Rust-Oleum) concerning alleged violations by Rust-Oleum of the Districts regulations in connection with Rust-Oleums facility located within the District (the Rust-Oleum Facility). In
settlement of the Districts claims for civil monetary penalties associated with the alleged manufacture, supply, sale, and offer for sale, for use within the District of architectural coatings containing volatile organic compounds
(VOC) in excess of stated VOC limits, Rust-Oleum has agreed to pay a cash penalty of $300,000. In addition, Rust-Oleum has agreed to pay a suspended penalty of $75,000 if Rust-Oleum violates any District rule or regulation regarding
architectural coatings within one year following the date of the Rust-Oleum Settlement Agreement.

As previously reported, several of our subsidiaries are, from time to time, identified as a
potentially responsible party under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state environmental statutes. In some cases, our subsidiaries are participating in the cost of certain
clean-up efforts or other remedial actions. Our share of such costs to date, however, has not been material and management believes that these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition
or results of operations. See Item 1  Business  Environmental Matters, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures  Not applicable.
