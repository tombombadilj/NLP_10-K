readers are urged to read carefully all cautionary statements contained in this Form 10-K. 
 Overview  
        iStar Financial Inc., or the "Company," is a fully-integrated finance and investment company focused on the commercial real
estate industry. The Company provides custom-tailored investment capital to high-end private and corporate owners of real estate and invests directly across a range of real estate sectors.
The Company, which is taxed as a real estate investment trust, or "REIT," has invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades. The Company's three primary business segments are
lending, net leasing and real estate investment. 
        The
lending portfolio is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from $20 million to $150 million and have original terms
generally ranging from three to ten years. These loans may be either fixed-rate (based on the U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread) or variable-rate (based on LIBOR plus a spread)
and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. The Company's portfolio also includes senior and subordinated loans to corporations, particularly those engaged in real estate or
real estate related businesses. These financings may be either secured or unsecured, typically range in size from $20 million to $150 million and have initial maturities generally
ranging from three to ten years. The Company's loan portfolio includes whole loans, loan participations and debt securities. 
        The
Company's net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by the Company and leased to single creditworthy tenants, where the properties are generally mission critical
headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at the facility to be paid by the tenant on a triple net lease basis.
Net lease transactions have initial terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years and typically range in size from $20 million to $150 million. 
        The
Company's real estate investment portfolio includes real estate held for investment ("REHI") and other real estate owned ("OREO") properties primarily acquired through foreclosure or
through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. Through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management, the
Company generally seeks to reposition and redevelop these 
1



 
Table of Contents
assets
with the objective of maximizing their value. The Company has developed significant expertise in the ownership and repositioning of multifamily, condominium, master planned and development
properties. 
        The
Company's primary sources of revenues are interest income, which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans, and operating lease income, which is the rent that corporate customers
pay to lease its properties. The Company primarily generates income through the "spread" or "margin," which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense
and the cost of its net lease operations. Going forward, the Company also expects to earn income from its other real estate investments. Income from real estate investments may include operating
revenues as well as income from sales of properties either in bulk or through unit sales. This income will be reduced by holding costs while the real estate investments are redeveloped, repositioned
and eventually sold. 
        The
Company began its business in 1993 through private investment funds and became publicly traded in 1998. Since that time, the Company has grown through the origination of new lending
and leasing transactions, as well as through corporate acquisitions. 
 Current Market Conditions  
        Weakened economic conditions and volatility within the commercial real estate and capital markets have adversely affected the Company's
business. These conditions have resulted in high levels of non-performing loans and increasing amounts of real estate owned as the Company has taken title to assets of defaulting
borrowers. The economic conditions also resulted in increased financing costs. The Company's capital sources in the past two years have primarily included loan repayments from borrowers, proceeds from
asset sales and proceeds from secured debt refinancing. The Company has limited new investments while focusing primarily on resolving problem assets, deleveraging and preserving shareholder value.
These factors continue to have an effect on the Company's operations and operating costs. A more detailed discussion of how current market conditions have impacted the Company is provided in
Item 7"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 Risk Management  
        The Company's risk management team is vertically integrated within the organization and comprised of in-house professionals
with expertise in asset management, legal, corporate credit, loan servicing, project and construction management and engineering. The risk management team includes a rated loan servicer, iStar Asset
Services, or "iSAS," that is focused on preserving and maximizing returns from the Company's investments while providing the Company's customers with comprehensive post-closing support.
The Company employs a proactive risk management strategy centered on information sharing and customer contact. 
        The
Company has a quarterly risk rating process designed to enable it to evaluate, monitor and manage asset-specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a
portfolio-wide basis. The quarterly risk rating process allows the Company to create a common language and framework to evaluate risk and the adequacy of the loan loss provision and
reserves. A credit review of each asset is performed with ratings of "1" to "5" assigned ("1" represents the lowest level of risk, "5" represents the highest level of risk). 
        The
Company also has collateral and customer monitoring risk management systems that enable it to review the performance of its asset base. Risk management information is generated from
collateral-level controls, customer reporting requirements and on-site asset and market monitoring programs. 
        iSAS,
the Company's rated loan servicing subsidiary, and the Company's asset management personnel are responsible for managing the Company's asset base, including monitoring customers'
compliance
with their respective loan and leasing agreements, collecting customer payments and analyzing and distributing customer performance information. In addition, these individuals manage the construction
oversight and disbursement process. iSAS performs servicing responsibilities primarily for Company owned assets. 
2



 
Table of Contents
        The
Company's risk management team employs an asset specific approach to managing and resolving loans that may become non-performing as well as REHI and OREO assets. Asset
performance or collectability can deteriorate due to a variety of factors, including adverse market conditions, construction delays and overruns, or a borrower's financial condition or managerial
capabilities. Once an asset's performance or collectability begins deteriorating and the Company believes the asset will become a non-performing loan ("NPL"), the team will
formulate an asset resolution strategy. 
        For
resolutions where title to collateral is obtained, the risk management team puts in place an asset-specific plan designed to maximize the value of the collateral. The plan may
include completing the construction or renovation of the property, continuing the sale of condominium units, leasing or increasing the occupancy of the property, engaging a third party property
manager or selling the entire asset or a partial interest to a third party. The Company may also seek to collect under guarantees of the loan. 
        The
risk management team responsible for a non-performing loan or REHI/OREO resolution presents its proposed plan to the Company's senior management team for discussion and
approval. The resolution plan is monitored on a quarterly basis and may be monitored more frequently, as necessary. Asset resolution strategies may be modified as conditions change. 
 Financing Strategy  
        The Company has utilized a wide range of debt and equity capital resources to finance its previous investment and growth strategies.
Prior to the onset of the credit crisis, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were its unsecured bank credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt and equity securities in capital markets
transactions and repayments from loan assets. Since 2008, the capital markets have been very volatile and liquidity has been constrained. As a result, the Company has sought alternative sources of
liquidity primarily through secured debt financings and asset sales, however these economic conditions have continued to impact the Company's cost of funds. The Company has sought, and may continue to
seek, to raise capital through all means including
secured financing, debt exchanges, unsecured financing, asset sales, issuance of equity, joint ventures and other third party capital arrangements in order to better align its asset and liability
profile. A more detailed discussion of the Company's current liquidity and capital resources is provided in Item 7"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations." 
 Investment Strategy  
        The Company has historically focused its investment strategy on the following:


Targeting the origination of large, custom-tailored mortgage, corporate and lease financings where customers require
flexible financial solutions and "one-call" responsiveness post-closing; 
Avoiding commodity businesses where there is significant direct competition from other providers of capital;  
Developing direct relationships with borrowers and corporate customers as opposed to sourcing transactions solely through
intermediaries; 
Adding value beyond simply providing capital by offering borrowers and corporate customers specific lending expertise,
flexibility, certainty of closing and continuing relationships beyond the closing of a particular financing transaction; 
Taking advantage of market anomalies in the real estate financing markets when, in the Company's view, credit was
mispriced by other providers of capital; and
Evaluating relative risk adjusted returns across multiple investment markets.

Table of Contents
        The
Company's portfolio is generally characterized by:


Diversity by asset type, property type, obligor, loan/lease maturity and geography;
and
Larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. 

        The
Company significantly curtailed its new investment activity since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. During this time, the Company has continued to fund
pre-existing commitments to assets in its portfolio and in the past two years has made select new investments, many of which represent add-on fundings or refinancings
pertaining to assets already in its portfolio. The Company believes that it has a competitive advantage in such opportunities because of existing relationships with the customer and
in-depth knowledge of the asset. The Company believes that investment opportunities within its existing $7.52 billion portfolio present attractive risk-adjusted return
opportunities and expects to make additional investments of this type in the future.

Table of Contents 
 Underwriting Process  
        The Company discusses and analyzes investment opportunities in meetings which are attended by its investment professionals, as well as
representatives from its legal, credit, risk management and capital markets areas. The Company has developed a process for screening potential investments called the Six Point
Methodologysm. Through this process, the Company evaluates an investment opportunity prior to beginning its formal due diligence process by: (1) evaluating the source of the
opportunity; (2) evaluating the quality of the collateral or corporate credit, as well as its market or industry dynamics; (3) evaluating the equity or corporate sponsor;
(4) determining whether it can implement an appropriate legal and financial structure for the transaction given its risk profile; (5) performing an alternative investment test; and
(6) evaluating the liquidity of the investment and its ability to match fund the asset. 
        The
Company's underwriting process provides for feedback and review by key disciplines within the Company, including investments, legal, credit, risk management and capital markets.
Participation is encouraged from professionals in these disciplines throughout the entire origination process, from the initial consideration of the opportunity, through the Six Point
Methodologysm and into the preparation and distribution of an approval memorandum for the Company's internal and/or Board of Directors investment committees. 
        Any
commitment to make an investment of $25 million or less ($50 million or less in the case of a corporate debt instrument or aggregate debt instruments issued by a single
corporate issuer) in any transaction or series of related transactions requires the approval of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. Any commitment in an amount in excess of
$25 million (or $50 million, in the case of a corporate debt instrument) but less than or equal to $75 million requires the further approval of the Company's internal investment
committee, consisting of senior management representatives from all of the Company's key disciplines. Any commitment in an amount in excess of $75 million but less than or equal to
$150 million requires the further approval of the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. Any commitment in an amount in excess of $150 million, and any strategic investment such
as a corporate merger, acquisition or material transaction involving the Company's entry into a new line of business, requires the approval of the full Board of Directors. 
 Hedging Strategy  
        The Company has variable-rate lending assets and variable-rate debt obligations. These assets and liabilities
create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates. This means that as interest rates increase, the Company earns more on its variable-rate lending assets and pays more on
its variable-rate debt obligations and, conversely, as interest rates decrease, the Company earns less on its variable-rate lending assets and pays less on its
variable-rate debt obligations. When the Company's variable-rate debt obligations differ significantly from its variable-rate lending assets, the Company may
utilize derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income. The Company also uses foreign currency swaps to limit its exposure to changes in currency rates in
respect of certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The derivative instruments the Company uses are typically in
the form of interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges. 
 Industry Segments  
        The Company has three business segments: Real Estate Lending, Net Leasing and Real Estate Investment. The Real Estate Lending segment
includes all of the Company's activities related to senior and mezzanine real estate debt and corporate capital investments. The Net Leasing segment includes all of the Company's activities related to
the ownership and leasing of
corporate facilities. The Real Estate Investment segment primarily includes all of the Company's activities related to the repositioning and redevelopment of REHI and OREO assets. Segment revenue and
profit information is presented in Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 17."

Table of Contents
 Real Estate Lending  
        The Company's Real Estate Lending segment includes loans and other lending investments, which primarily consist of senior mortgage
loans that are secured by commercial and residential real estate assets. A smaller portion of the portfolio consists of subordinated mortgage loans that are secured by subordinated interests in
commercial and residential real estate assets and corporate/partnership loans, which may be senior or subordinate and corporate debt securities. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, a portion of the Company's loan portfolio was designated as non-performing. Non-performing loans are placed on
non-accrual status and reserves for loan losses are recorded to the extent these loans are determined to be impaired. See Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental
DataNote 3" for a discussion of the Company's policies regarding non-performing loans and reserves for loan losses.

 Net Leasing  
        The Company has pursued the origination of net lease transactions by structuring purchase/leasebacks and by acquiring facilities
subject to existing long-term net leases. In a typical purchase/leaseback transaction, the Company purchases a corporation's facility and leases it back to that corporation subject to a
long-term net lease. This structure allows the corporate customer to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its facilities into its core business, while the Company benefits from a
long-term income stream. The Company generally intends to hold its net lease assets for long-term investment. However, subject to certain tax restrictions, the Company may
dispose of assets if it deems the disposition to be in the Company's best interests. 
        Under
a typical net lease agreement, the corporate customer agrees to pay a base monthly operating lease payment and all facility operating expenses (including taxes, maintenance and
insurance). The Company generally seeks corporate customers that are established companies with stable core businesses or market leaders in growing or stable industries with commitments to the
facilities that are mission-critical to their ongoing businesses. 
        During
2010, the Company sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $1.17 billion including a $1.05 billion portfolio of 32 net lease assets that represented
approximately 30% of the net book value of the Company's net lease portfolio at the time of disposition. These sales resulted in gains of $270.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2010. See Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental DataNote 6" for further details on segment activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
         Summary of Portfolio CharacteristicsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company owned 299 facilities, comprising 23.5 million square feet in
35 states with a carrying value of $1.70 billion. In addition, net lease assets were 92.0% leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 12 years. 
        As

 Real Estate Investment  
        The Real Estate Investment segment includes all of the Company's activities related to the repositioning and redevelopment of assets
that are primarily acquired through foreclosure or through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. Properties are
designated as REHI or OREO depending on the Company's business plan to realize the maximum value from the collateral received. When the Company intends to hold, operate or develop a property for a
period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as REHI, and when it intends to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as OREO. The Company generally seeks
to reposition and redevelop assets within
this portfolio through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management, with the objective of maximizing their value. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company received title to properties with an aggregate estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure of $502.5 million, in
full or partial satisfaction of non-performing mortgage loans for which those properties had served as collateral. Of these, properties with a value of $396.2 million were
classified as REHI and $106.3 million were classified as OREO, based on management's current intention to either hold the properties over a longer period or to market them for sale in the near
term. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold OREO assets with a carrying value of $176.5 million. A portion of these were sales of residential property units from
which the Company recorded income of $5.7 million. See Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental DataNote 5" for further details on segment activities
during 2011, 2010 and 2009.

 Policies with Respect to Other Activities  
        The Company's investment, financing and corporate governance policies (including conflicts of interests policies) are managed under the
ultimate supervision of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company can amend, revise or eliminate these policies at anytime without a vote of shareholders. The Company currently intends to make
investments in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for the Company to qualify as a REIT. 
 Investment Restrictions or Limitations  
        The Company does not have any prescribed allocation among investments or product lines. Instead, the Company focuses on corporate and
real estate credit underwriting to
develop an analysis of the risk/reward trade-offs in determining the pricing and advisability of each particular transaction. 
        The
Company believes that it is not, and intends to conduct its operations so as not to become, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Investment
Company Act generally exempts entities that are "primarily engaged in purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate" (collectively, "Qualifying
Interests"). The Company intends to rely on current interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to qualify for this exemption. Based on these interpretations, the Company,
among other things, must maintain at least 55% of its assets in Qualifying Interests and at least 25% of its assets in real estate- related assets (subject to reduction to the extent the Company
invests more than 55% of its assets in Qualifying Interests). The Company's senior mortgages, net lease assets and certain of its subordinated mortgages generally constitute Qualifying Interests.
Subject to the limitations on ownership of certain types of assets and the gross income tests imposed by the Code, the Company also may invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged
in real estate activities or other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

Table of Contents
 Competition  
        The Company operates in a competitive market. See Item 1a"Risk factorsWe compete with a variety of
financing and leasing sources for our customers," for a discussion of how we may be affected by competition. 
 Regulation  
        The operations of the Company are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental
authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting
activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; and (5) set
collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest
rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing
of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. The Company is also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to
commercial loans. 
        In
the judgment of management, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the business conducted by the Company. It is not possible at this time to
forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon the future business, financial condition or results of operations
or prospects of the Company. 
        The
Company has elected and expects to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company must generally distribute at
least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders each year. In addition, the Company must distribute 100% of its net taxable income each year to avoid paying federal
income taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT qualification. These requirements include specific share ownership
tests and asset and gross income tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on its net taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to state and local taxes and to federal income tax and
excise tax on its undistributed income. 
 Code of Conduct  
        The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our directors,
officers and employees. The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Conduct has been
provided to each of our directors, officers and employees, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Conduct. A copy of the Company's Code of Conduct has
been previously filed with the SEC and is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 14.0. The Code of Conduct is also available on the Company's
website at www.istarfinancial.com. The Company intends to post on its website material changes to, or waivers from, its Code of Conduct, if any, within
two days of any such event. As of December 31, 2011, there were no waivers or changes since adoption of the current Code of Conduct in October 2002.

    Item 1a.    Risk Factors     
        In addition to the other information in this document, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating an
investment in our securities. Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows, and trading price
of our common stock. For purposes of these risk factors, the terms "we," "our" and "us" refer to iStar Financial Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 
 
  Risks Related to Our Business     
 Changes in general economic conditions have and may continue to adversely affect our business.  
        Our success is generally dependent upon economic conditions in the U.S. and, in particular, the geographic areas in which a substantial
number of our investments are located. Substantially all businesses, including ours, were negatively affected by the recent economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the credit and
commercial real estate markets. Although there were early signs of improvement in the commercial real estate and credit markets beginning in 2010 and in 2011, such markets remain volatile and it is
not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results. Deterioration in economic trends could have a
material adverse effect on our financial performance and our ability to meet our debt obligations. 
 We have significant indebtedness and limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us.  
        Sufficient liquidity is critical to the management of our balance sheet and our ability to meet our scheduled debt payments. However,
liquidity in the capital markets has been constrained since the beginning of the credit crisis and our cost of funds has increased. During this time, we have primarily relied on secured borrowings,
repayments from our loan assets and proceeds from asset sales to fund our operations and meet our debt maturities, and we expect to continue to rely primarily on these sources of liquidity for the
foreseeable future. Our ability to access these and other sources of capital will be subject to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as conditions prevailing in the
credit and real estate markets. There can be no assurance that we will have access to liquidity when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we may decide to pursue
transactions, such as sales of assets, on terms that would not otherwise be attractive to us in order to generate sufficient liquidity. We may also encounter difficulty in finding buyers of assets or
executing capital raising strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could impact our ability to make scheduled repayments on our outstanding debt. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.60 billion of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before December 31, 2012. Of this
amount, $211.6 million represents the minimum amortization payable by December 31, 2012 under the Secured Credit Facility, which is collateralized by assets with a carrying value of
$3.08 billion. We expect to use proceeds from repayments and sales of the pledged collateral to meet these amortization payments. The remaining $1.38 billion of maturing debt represents
unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature during 2012 as follows ($ in thousands):

        As of December 31, 2011 we had unrestricted cash of $356.8 million and other unencumbered assets with a carrying value of
$3.69 billion that are available to repay these maturities through asset sales or debt refinancing transactions. Failure to repay or refinance our borrowings as they come due would be an event 
14



 
Table of Contents
of
default under the relevant debt instruments, which could result in a cross default and acceleration of the Company's other outstanding debt obligations, all of which would have a material adverse
effect on our business and stock price. 
 We have suffered adverse consequences as a result of our credit ratings.  
        Our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings. Our unsecured corporate
credit ratings from major national credit rating agencies are currently below investment grade. Having below investment grade credit ratings has increased our borrowing costs and caused restrictive
covenants in our public debt instruments to become operative. These restrictive covenants are described below in "Covenants in our indebtedness could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our
financial condition." These factors have adversely impacted our financial performance and will continue to do so unless our credit ratings improve. 
 Covenants in our indebtedness could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  
        Our outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered
assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a restriction on debt incurrence based upon the effect of the debt incurrence on our fixed charge coverage. If any of our covenants are breached
and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the
bondholders. While we expect that our ability to incur new indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio will be limited for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be permitted to incur
indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures. 
        Our
Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with
affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, we are required to maintain collateral coverage of 1.25x outstanding
borrowings. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the Secured Credit Facility permits us to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis. We may not pay
common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT. 
        Our
Secured Credit Facility contains cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay
amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for
any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse
indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated. 
        The
covenants described above could limit our flexibility and make it more difficult and/or expensive to refinance our existing indebtedness and make new investments. In addition, a
default by us on our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business and the market prices of our Common Stock. 
 Our reserves for loan losses may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  
        We maintain loan loss reserves to protect against potential losses and conduct a review of the adequacy of these reserves on a
quarterly basis. Our general loan loss reserve
reflects management's then-current estimation of the probability and severity of losses within our portfolio, based on this quarterly review. In addition, our determination of
asset-specific loan loss reserves relies on material 
15



 
Table of Contents
estimates
regarding the fair value of loan collateral. Estimation of ultimate loan losses, provision expenses and loss reserves is a complex and subjective process. As such, there can be no assurance
that management's judgment will prove to be correct and that reserves will be adequate over time to protect against potential future losses. Such losses could be caused by factors including, but not
limited to, unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific assets, borrowers, industries in which our borrowers operate or markets in which our borrowers or their
properties are located. In particular, our non-performing loans increased significantly during the financial crisis, driven by the weak economy and the disruption of the credit markets
which adversely impacted the ability and willingness of many of our borrowers to service their debt and refinance our loans to them at maturity. If our reserves for credit losses prove inadequate we
may suffer additional losses which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. 
 We are required to make a number of judgments in applying accounting policies, and different estimates and assumptions could result in changes to our financial condition and
results of operations.  
        Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to our determination of the reserve for loan losses,
which is based primarily on the estimated fair value of loan collateral, as well as the valuation of net lease, OREO and REHI assets, intangible assets and deferred tax assets. While we have
identified those accounting policies that are considered critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could
have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
 We have suffered losses when a borrower defaults on a loan and the underlying collateral is not sufficient, and we may suffer additional losses in the future.  
        We have suffered significant losses arising from borrower defaults on our loan assets and we may suffer additional losses in the
future. In the event of a default by a borrower on a non-recourse loan, we will only have recourse to the real estate-related assets collateralizing the loan. If the underlying collateral
value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a
loss. Conversely, we sometimes make loans that are unsecured or are secured only by equity interests in the borrowing entities. These loans are subject to the risk that other lenders may be directly
secured by the real estate assets of the borrower. In the event of a default, those collateralized lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying real
estate. In cases described above, we may lack control over the underlying asset collateralizing our loan or the underlying assets of the borrower prior to a default, and as a result the value of the
collateral may be reduced by acts or omissions by owners or managers of the assets. 
        We
sometimes obtain individual or corporate guarantees from borrowers or their affiliates. In cases where guarantees are not fully or partially secured, we typically rely on financial
covenants from borrowers and guarantors which are designed to require the borrower or guarantor to maintain certain levels of creditworthiness. Where we do not have recourse to specific collateral
pledged to satisfy such guarantees or recourse loans, we will only have recourse as an unsecured creditor to the general assets of the borrower or guarantor, some or all of which may be pledged to
satisfy other lenders. There can be no assurance that a borrower or guarantor will comply with its financial covenants, or that sufficient assets will be available to pay amounts owed to us under our
loans and guarantees. As a result of these factors, we may suffer additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
        In
the event of a borrower bankruptcy, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower in order to satisfy our loan. In addition, certain of our loans are subordinate to
other debts of the borrower. If a borrower defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt receives
payment. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies
(through "standstill" periods) and control decisions 
16



 
Table of Contents
made
in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers. Bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase collection costs and losses and the time necessary to acquire title to the
underlying collateral, during which time the collateral may decline in value, causing us to suffer additional losses. 
        If
the value of collateral underlying our loan declines or interest rates increase during the term of our loan, a borrower may not be able to obtain the necessary funds to repay our loan
at maturity through refinancing. Decreasing collateral value and/or increasing interest rates may hinder a borrower's ability to refinance our loan because the underlying property cannot satisfy the
debt service coverage requirements necessary to obtain new financing. If a borrower is unable to repay our loan at maturity, we could suffer additional loss which may adversely impact our financial
performance. 
 We are subject to additional risks associated with loan participations.  
        Some of our loans are participation interests or co-lender arrangements in which we share the rights, obligations and
benefits of the loan with other lenders. We may need the consent of these parties to exercise our rights under such loans, including rights with respect to amendment of loan documentation, enforcement
proceedings in the event of default and the institution of, and control over, foreclosure proceedings. Similarly, a majority of the participants may be able to take actions to which we object but to
which we will be bound if our participation interest represents a minority interest. We may be adversely affected by this lack of full control. 
 We are subject to additional risk associated with foreclosed assets  
        We have obtained title to a number of assets that have served as collateral on defaulted loans. These assets are classified as REHI or
OREO, based on our intention to either hold the properties over a longer period or to market them for sale in the near term. The assets are predominantly land and substantially completed
condominium/multi-family projects. We must incur costs to carry these assets and in some cases make improvements to or complete the assets. These activities require additional liquidity and also
result in additional expenses that impact our operating results. In addition, to the extent we need to raise liquidity through asset sales, we may be limited in our ability to sell these assets in a
short time frame. We currently have several loans that are in default and to the extent the borrowers cannot cure the default, we could take title to these assets, which would require additional
liquidity and further increase our expenses. 
 We may experience losses if the creditworthiness of our net lease asset tenants deteriorates and they are unable to meet their lease obligations.  
        We own the properties leased to the tenants of our net lease assets and receive rents from the tenants during the contracted term of
such leases. A tenant's ability to pay rent is determined by its creditworthiness, among other factors. If a tenant's credit deteriorates, the tenant may default on its obligations under our lease and
may also become bankrupt. The bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants or other failure to pay is likely to adversely affect the income produced by our net lease assets. If a tenant defaults, we may
experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to evict the tenant solely because of such bankruptcy or failure
to pay. A court, however, may authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap
that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In addition, certain amounts paid to us within 90 days prior to the tenant's bankruptcy filing could be required
to be returned to the tenant's bankruptcy estate. In any event, it is highly unlikely that a bankrupt or insolvent tenant would pay in full amounts it owes us under a lease. In other circumstances,
where a tenant's financial condition has become impaired, we may agree to partially or wholly terminate the lease in advance of the termination date in consideration for a lease termination
fee that is likely less than the total contractual rental amount. Without regard to the manner in which the lease termination occurs, we are likely to incur additional costs in the form of tenant
improvements and leasing commissions in our efforts to lease the space to a new 
17



 
Table of Contents
tenant.
In any of the foregoing circumstances, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 
 Lease expirations, lease defaults and lease terminations may adversely affect our revenue.  
        Lease expirations and lease terminations may result in reduced revenues if the lease payments received from replacement tenants are
less than the lease payments received from the expiring or terminating corporate tenants. In addition, lease defaults or lease terminations by one or more significant tenants or the failure of tenants
under expiring leases to elect to renew their leases could cause us to experience long periods of vacancy with no revenue from a facility and to incur substantial capital expenditures and/or lease
concessions in order to obtain replacement tenants. 
 We are subject to risks relating to our asset concentration.  
        Our portfolio consists primarily of large balance commercial real estate loans and net lease, OREO and REHI assets. Our asset base is
generally diversified by asset type, obligor, property type and geographic location. However, as of December 31, 2011, approximately 19.7% of the carrying value of our assets related to land,
18.4% related to apartment/residential assets, 11.4% related to retail properties and 10.2% related to office properties. All of these types of collateral have been adversely affected by the financial
crisis. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, approximately 23.7% of the carrying value of our assets related to properties located in the western U.S., 18.6% related to properties located in
the northeastern U.S., 15.0% related to properties located in the southeast U.S and 12.1% related to properties located in the southwestern U.S. These regions include areas such as Florida, California
and Nevada that were particularly hard hit by the downturn in the residential real estate markets. We may suffer additional losses on our assets based on these concentrations. 
        We
underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and customers and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash
security
deposits. Although our loans and other lending investments and net lease assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and customers operate in a variety of industries, to the extent we have a
significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or customer, the inability of that borrower or customer to make its payment could have an adverse effect on
us. As of December 31, 2011, our five largest borrowers or tenants of net lease assets collectively accounted for approximately 22.4% of our aggregate annualized interest and operating lease
revenue, of which no single customer accounts for more than 8.0%. 
 We compete with a variety of financing and leasing sources for our customers.  
        The financial services industry and commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include finance companies,
other REITs, commercial banks and thrift institutions, investment banks and hedge funds. Our competitors seek to compete aggressively on the basis of a number of factors including transaction pricing,
terms and structure. We may have difficulty competing to the extent we are unwilling to match our competitors' deal terms in order to maintain our interest margins and/or credit standards. To the
extent that we match competitors' pricing, terms or structure, we may experience decreased interest margins and/or increased risk of credit losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
performance. 
        We
face significant competition within our net leasing business from other owners, operators and developers of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where
we operate. Such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our
properties, which may result in their owners being willing to rent space at lower rental rates than we would or providing greater tenant improvement allowances or other leasing concessions. This
combination of circumstances could adversely affect our revenues and financial performance.

 We are subject to certain risks associated with investing in real estate, including potential liabilities under environmental laws and risks of loss from earthquakes and
terrorism.  
        Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate
(including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic
substances at, on, under or in its property. Those laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the
release or presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The owner or control party of a site may be
subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in
connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injuries associated with
asbestos-containing materials. While a secured lender is not likely to be subject to these forms of environmental liability, when we foreclose on real property, we become an owner and are
subject to the risks of environmental liability. Additionally, under our net lease assets we require our tenants to undertake the obligation for environmental compliance and indemnify us from
liability with respect thereto. There can be no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient resources to satisfy their obligations to us. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, approximately 27.2% of the carrying value of our assets was located in the Western and Northwestern United States, geographic areas at higher risk for
earthquakes. In addition, a significant number of our properties are located in New York City and other major urban areas which, in recent years, have been high risk geographical areas for terrorism
and threats of terrorism. Future earthquakes or acts of terrorism could adversely impact the demand for, and value of, our assets and could also directly impact the value of our assets through damage,
destruction or loss, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against these events. Although we believe our owned real estate and the properties
collateralizing our loan assets are adequately covered by insurance, we cannot predict at this time if we or our borrowers will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the
future, or if we will be able to continue to pass along all of the costs of insurance to our tenants. Any earthquake or terrorist attack, whether or not insured, could have a material adverse effect
on our financial performance, the market price of our Common Stock and our ability to pay dividends. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our property insurers may not be able to fulfill
its obligations with respect to claims payments due to a deterioration in its financial condition. 
 From time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our current
operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.  
        From time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole
control. These investments include but are not limited to: LNR Property Corporation ("LNR"), Madison Funds and other equity and mezzanine investments. Although these businesses generally have a
significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary business segments including, without limitation, special servicing of securitized debt.
Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control
over the operations of these businesses. 
        From
time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control,
including joint ventures, present additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those
persons. In addition, we rely on the 
19



 
Table of Contents
internal
controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us. 
 Declines in the market values of our equity investments may adversely affect periodic reported results.  
        Most of our equity investments are in funds or companies that are not publicly traded and their fair value may not be readily
determinable. We may periodically estimate the fair value of these investments, based upon available information and management's judgment. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, they may
fluctuate over short periods of time. In addition, our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments may be materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their
disposal, which could result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends. 
 We may utilize derivative instruments to hedge risk, which may adversely affect our borrowing cost and expose us to other risks.  
        The derivative instruments we may use are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps. Interest rate swaps
effectively change variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate debt obligations or fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate debt obligations.
Foreign currency swaps limit our exposure to changes in currency rates in respect of certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. 
        Our
use of derivative instruments also involves the risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that we may have to pay certain costs,
such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if a hedging arrangement is terminated by us. As a matter of policy, we enter into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large, creditworthy
financial institutions typically rated at least "A/A2" by S&P and Moody's, respectively. 
        Developing
an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and foreign currencies is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such
fluctuations. There can be no assurance that any hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Significant increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  
        Our operating results depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest
expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect the spread between our interest
earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to the impact of interest rate floors and caps, as well as the amounts of floating rate assets and liabilities. Any significant compression of
the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment, rates could
exceed the interest rate floors that exist on certain of our floating rate debt and create a mismatch between our floating rate loans and our floating rate debt that could have a significant adverse
effect on our operating results. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest bearing assets and our ability to realize
gains from the sale of such assets. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions,
and other factors beyond our control. 
 Quarterly results may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future quarterly performance.  
        Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate; therefore, reliance should not be placed on past quarterly results as indicative of
our performance in future quarters. Factors that could cause quarterly operating results to fluctuate include, among others, variations in loan and net lease portfolio performance, levels of
non-performing assets and related provisions, market values of investments, costs

associated
with debt, general economic conditions, the state of the real estate and financial markets and the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets. 
 Our ability to retain and attract key personnel is critical to our success.  
        Our success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and the other key members of our management team and recruit
additional qualified personnel. We rely in part on equity compensation to retain and incentivize our personnel. In addition, if members of our management join competitors or form competing companies,
the competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. Efforts to retain or attract professionals may result in additional compensation expense, which could affect our financial
performance. 
 We are highly dependent on information systems, and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business.  
        Our business is highly dependent on communications, information, financial and operational systems. Any failure or interruption of our
systems could cause delays or other problems in our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. 
 We may change certain of our policies without stockholder approval.  
        Our charter does not set forth specific percentages of the types of investments we may make. We can amend, revise or eliminate our
investment financing and conflict of interest policies at any time at our discretion without a vote of our shareholders. A change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition or
results of operations or the market price of our common stock. 
 Certain provisions in our charter may inhibit a change in control.  
        Generally, to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be
owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of our taxable year. The Code defines "individuals" for purposes of the requirement described in the
preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under our charter, no person may own more than 9.8% of our outstanding shares of stock, with some exceptions. The restrictions on transferability
and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the security holders. 
 We would be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT.  
        We believe that we have been organized and operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax
purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1998. However, our qualification as a REIT has depended and will continue to depend on our ability to meet various requirements
concerning, among other things, the ownership of our outstanding stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders. As a result of the
current credit crisis, it may be difficult for us to meet one or more of the requirements for qualification as a REIT including, but not limited to, our distribution requirement. 
        If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our shareholders in computing our net taxable income and would be
subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, or "AMT," on our net taxable income at regular corporate rates, as well as applicable state and local taxes.
Unless entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years following the year during which our REIT
qualification was lost. As a result, cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved. Furthermore, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other
considerations may cause our REIT qualification to be revoked. 
21



 
Table of Contents
        Our
Secured Credit Facility (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental DataNote 9") prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock
if we no longer qualify as a REIT. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds, sell assets or take other actions during unfavorable market conditions.  
        To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital
gains each year, and we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as applicable state and local taxes, to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In
addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of
our capital gain net income and 100% of our
undistributed income from prior years. Our net taxable income could exceed our available cash flow as a result of, among other things, a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and
inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the recognition of non-cash taxable income, the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures or required debt
principal repayments. 
        In
order to qualify as a REIT and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term, or possibly long-term, basis, sell
assets or pay distributions in the form of taxable dividends of our common stock to meet our REIT distribution requirement, even if prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings,
asset dispositions or stock distributions. 
 Certain of our activities are subject to taxes and could result in taxes allocated to our shareholders and reduce our cash flows.  
        Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state, local and
non-U.S. taxes on our income and property, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from certain activities conducted as a result of foreclosures, and property and
transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. We would be required to pay taxes on net taxable income that we fail to distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we hold several assets in our
"taxable REIT subsidiaries" which are fully taxable corporations, and as a result, may be required to pay income taxes related to these assets. There are also limitations on the ability of taxable
REIT subsidiaries to make interest payments to affiliated REITs. Furthermore, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax to the extent our economic arrangements with our tenants or our taxable REIT
subsidiaries are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. We will also be subject to a 100% tax to the extent we derive income from the sale of assets to customers in the
ordinary course of business. To the extent we or our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes, we will have less cash available for
distribution to our shareholders. 
 Our Investment Company Act exemption limits our investment discretion and loss of the exemption would adversely affect us.  
        We believe that we currently are not, and we intend to operate our company so that we will not be, regulated as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act because we are "primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate." Specifically, we are
required to invest at least 55% of our assets in "qualifying real estate assets" (that is, real estate, mortgage loans and other qualifying interests in real estate), and at least an additional 25% of
our assets in other "real estate-related assets," such as mezzanine loans and unsecured investments in real estate entities, or additional qualifying real estate assets. 
        We
will need to monitor our assets to ensure that we continue to satisfy the percentage tests. Maintaining our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act limits our ability to invest in assets that otherwise would meet our investment strategies. If we fail to qualify 
22



 
Table of Contents
for
this exemption, we could not operate our business efficiently under the regulatory scheme imposed on investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and we could be required to restructure
our activities. This would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and the market price of our securities.

    Item 3.    Legal Proceedings     
        The Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary routine
litigation incidental to its business as a finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry, including loan foreclosure and foreclosure-related proceedings. In addition to
such matters, the Company or its subsidiaries is a party to, or any of their property is the subject of, the following pending legal proceedings. 
 Citiline Holdings, Inc., et al. v. iStar Financial, Inc., et al.  
        In April 2008, two putative class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York naming the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers as defendants and alleging violations of federal securities laws. Both suits were purportedly filed on behalf of the
same putative class of investors who purchased Common Stock in the Company's December 13, 2007 public offering (the "Company's Offering"). The two complaints were consolidated in a single
proceeding (the "Citiline Action") on April 30, 2008. 
        On
November 17, 2008, Plumbers Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund and Citiline Holdings, Inc. were appointed Lead Plaintiffs to pursue the Citiline Action. Plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint on February 2, 2009, purportedly on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased the Company's Common Stock between December 6, 2007 and
March 6, 2008 (the "Complaint"). The Complaint named as defendants the Company, certain of its current and former executive officers, and certain investment banks who served as underwriters in
the Company's Offering. The Complaint reasserted claims for alleged violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act, and added claims for alleged violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs allege the defendants made certain material misstatements and omissions relating to the Company's continuing operations, including the
value of the Company's loan portfolio and certain debt securities held by the Company. The Complaint seeks certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and
attorney's fees, and rescission of the public offering. No class has been certified. The Company and its current and former officers filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on April 27, 2009
and, on March 26, 2010, the Court issued its order granting, in part, the dismissal of certain Securities
Act claims against certain of the Company's current and former officers, but denying the motion as to all claims asserted against the Company. Accordingly, the discovery process has commenced and is
ongoing. The Company believes the Citiline Action has no merit and intends to continue defending itself vigorously against it. 
 Shareholder Derivative Actions  
        Two shareholder derivative actions were filed in April and May 2010, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, purportedly on the Company's behalf, alleging various claims against the Company's Board of Directors and certain current and former executive officers. These actions arise out of the same
facts and circumstances alleged in the Citiline Action (described above) and assert that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and were liable to the Company for
unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets. 
        On
March 31, 2011, the District Court issued its order dismissing one of these suits, Kautz v. Sugarman, et al., in its entirety. Plaintiff appealed this dismissal and on
November 21, 2011 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. 
        Also
on March 31, 2011, the District Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the other action, Vancil v. Sugarman, et al., and granted Plaintiff the opportunity to
conduct limited discovery related to the subject matter of the suit. Plaintiff in the Vancil matter subsequently moved to voluntarily dismiss her derivative action. On January 9, 2012, pursuant
to the District Court's order, the parties posted notice of Plaintiff's intent to voluntarily dismiss the action on the Company's and Counsel for Plaintiff's websites 
24



 
Table of Contents
and
notified shareholders of their right to submit objections to the voluntary dismissal to the District Court. Following a public hearing held on February 24, 2012, the District Court granted
Plaintiff's motion to dismiss her action voluntarily and the Vancil matter has now been dismissed. 
 Shareholder Letters  
        In 2010, the Company received letters from two shareholders alleging that certain current and former officers and directors breached
their fiduciary duties to the Company. The allegations made in these two letters are materially the same as those made in the Vancil suit described in the preceding section. A special committee of
independent directors was formed by the Board of Directors to investigate the claims made in these letters. The shareholders on whose behalf these letters were written complied with the special
committee's request to furnish evidence of their continuous ownership of iStar shares. The special committee of independent directors undertook a thorough investigation of the claims made in these
letters and concluded there is no substantiation for the claims of wrongful conduct referenced in the letters. On May 10, 2011, after careful analysis and deliberation of the findings and
recommendations of the special committee, the Board of Directors voted unanimously to adopt the special committee's recommendation to reject the demands contained in these letters and to terminate any
pending derivative actions based upon such demands. The shareholders were apprised of the Board's conclusions immediately thereafter.

        On February 23, 2012, the closing sale price of the Common Stock as reported by the NYSE was $7.01. The Company had 2,569 holders of record
of Common Stock as of February 23, 2012. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the Company had five series of preferred stock outstanding: 8.000% Series D Preferred Stock, 7.875% Series E Preferred Stock, 7.8%
Series F Preferred Stock, 7.65% Series G Preferred Stock and 7.50% Series I Preferred Stock. Each of the Series D, E, F, G and I preferred stock is publicly traded. 
 Dividends  
        The Board of Directors has not established any minimum distribution level. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the
Company intends to pay dividends to its shareholders that, on an annual basis, will represent at least 90% of its taxable income (which may not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance
with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. The Company has recorded net operating losses and may record net operating losses in the
future, which may reduce its taxable income in future periods and lower or eliminate entirely the Company's obligation to pay dividends for such periods in order to maintain its REIT qualification. 
        Holders
of Common Stock, vested High Performance Units and certain unvested restricted stock units and common share equivalents will be entitled to receive distributions if, as and when
the Board of Directors authorizes and declares distributions. However, rights to distributions may be subordinated to the rights of holders of preferred stock, when preferred stock is issued and
outstanding. In addition, the Company's Secured Credit Facility (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental DataNote 9") permits the Company to distribute
100% of its REIT taxable income on an annual basis, for so long as the Company maintains its qualification as a REIT. The Secured Credit Facility restricts the Company from paying any common dividends
if it ceases to qualify as a REIT. In any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each outstanding share of Common Stock and HPU share equivalent will entitle its holder to a
proportionate share of the assets that remain after the Company pays its liabilities and any preferential distributions owed to preferred shareholders. 
        The
Company did not declare or pay dividends on its Common Stock for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company declared and paid dividends aggregating
$8.0 million, $11.0 million, $7.8 million, $6.1 million and $9.4 million on its Series D, E, F, G, and I preferred stock, 
26



 
Table of Contents
respectively,
for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There are no dividend arrearages on any of the preferred shares currently outstanding. 
        Distributions
to shareholders will generally be taxable as ordinary income, although all or a portion of such distributions may be designated by the Company as capital gain or may
constitute a tax-free return of capital. The Company annually furnishes to each of its shareholders a statement setting forth the distributions paid during the preceding year and their
characterization as ordinary income, capital gain or return of capital. 
        No
assurance can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions, as such distributions are subject to the Company's taxable income after giving effect to its net operating
loss carryforwards, financial condition, capital requirements, debt covenants, any change in the Company's intention to maintain its REIT qualification and such other factors as the Company's Board of
Directors deems relevant. In addition, based upon guidance announced by the Internal Revenue Service, the Company may elect to satisfy some of its 2011 REIT distribution requirements, if any, through
qualifying stock dividends.

(1)Stock
OptionsAs more fully discussed in Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 13,"
there were 44,296 stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2011. These options, together with their weighted average exercise price, have been included in columns (a) and (b), above.
(2)Restricted
StockThe amount shown in column (a) includes 9,985,063 unvested restricted stock units which may vest in the future based on
the employees' continued service to the Company. None of these unvested units are included in the Company's outstanding share balance (see Item 8"Financial Statements and
Supplementary DataNote 13" for a more detailed description of the Company's restricted stock grants). Substantially all of the restricted stock units included in column
(a) are required to be settled on a net, after-tax basis (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings); therefore, the actual number of shares issued will be
less than the gross amount of the awards. The amounts shown in column (a) also include 343,118 common stock equivalents awarded to our non-employee directors in consideration of
their service to us as directors. Common stock equivalents represent rights to receive shares of Common Stock at the date the Common Stock Equivalents are settled. Common stock equivalents have
dividend equivalent rights beginning on the date of grant. The amount in column (c) represents the aggregate amount of stock options, shares of restricted stock awards or other performance
awards that could be granted under compensation plans approved by the Company's security holders after giving effect to previously issued awards of stock options, shares of restricted stock and other
performance awards (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 13" for a more detailed description of the Company's Long-Term
Incentive Plans).

Explanatory Notes:





(1)HPU
holders are current and former Company employees who purchased high performance common stock units under the Company's High Performance Unit Program.
Participating Security holders are Company employees and directors who hold unvested restricted stock units and common stock equivalents granted under the Company's Long Term Incentive Plans.
(2)See
Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 14."
(3)For
the year ended December 31, 2007, net income used to calculate earnings per diluted common share and HPU share includes joint venture income of
$85.
(4)The
Company has not declared or paid a common dividend since the quarter ended June 30, 2008. In December of 2007, the Company declared a special
$0.25 common dividend, in addition to its regular quarterly dividends, due to higher taxable income generated as a result of the Company's acquisition of Fremont CRE.
(5)Adjusted
EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Adjusted EBITDA
should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is Adjusted EBITDA indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs or available for distribution to
shareholders. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is an additional measure for the Company to use to analyze how its business is performing. In addition, in calculating its ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to interest
expense and preferred stock dividends, the Company makes adjustments for impairments of assets and provisions for loan losses because they are significant non-cash items and the Company
believes that investors may find it useful to consider the Company's coverage of its interest and preferred dividend payments without the effect of these non-cash items, as an additional
measure to earnings to fixed charges. It should be noted that the Company's manner of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by other companies. 

29



 
Table of Contents


(6)Adjusted
EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) plus the sum of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, provision for loan losses,
impairment of assets, stock-based compensation expense and less the gain on early extinguishment of debt, net.

 Introduction  
        iStar Financial Inc. is a fully-integrated finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry. We
provide custom-tailored investment capital to high-end private and corporate owners of real estate and invest directly across a range of real estate sectors. We are taxed as a real estate
investment trust, or "REIT," and have invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades. Our primary business segments are lending, net leasing and real estate investment. 
        The
lending portfolio is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from $20 million to $150 million and have original terms
generally ranging from three to ten years. These loans may be either fixed-rate (based on the U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread) or variable-rate (based on LIBOR plus a spread)
and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. Our portfolio also includes senior and subordinated loans to corporations, particularly those engaged in real estate or real
estate related businesses. These financings may be either secured or unsecured, typically range in size from $20 million to $150 million and have initial maturities generally ranging
from three to ten years. Our loan portfolio includes whole loans, loan participations and debt securities. 
        Our
net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to single creditworthy tenants, where the properties are generally mission critical headquarters or
distribution facilities that are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at
the facility to be paid by the tenant on a triple net lease basis. Net lease transactions have initial terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years and typically range in size from
$20 million to $150 million. 
        Our
real estate investment portfolio includes real estate held for investment ("REHI") and other real estate owned ("OREO") properties primarily acquired through foreclosure or through
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. Through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management, we generally
seek to reposition and redevelop these assets with the objective 
31



 
Table of Contents
of
maximizing their value. We have developed significant expertise in the ownership and repositioning of multifamily, condominium, master planned and development properties. 
        Our
primary sources of revenues are interest income, which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans, and operating lease income, which is the rent that corporate customers pay to
lease our properties. We primarily generate income through the "spread" or "margin," which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense and the cost of
net lease operations. Going forward, we also expect to earn income from our other real estate investments. Income from real estate investments may include operating revenues as well as income from
sales of properties either in bulk or through unit sales. This income will be reduced by holding costs while the real estate investments are redeveloped, repositioned and eventually sold. 
 Executive Overview  
        The recent economic recession adversely affected our business, resulting in significant provisions for loan losses and impairments,
increasing amounts of non-performing loans, higher financing costs and an inability to access the unsecured debt markets. During the recession and continuing through 2011, we focused on
resolving non-performing assets, generating liquidity, retiring debt, decreasing leverage and preserving shareholder value. In furtherance of these objectives, in 2011 we completed
$2.96 billion of secured debt refinancing transactions, which enabled us to meet our debt maturities and improve our debt maturity profile, though at a higher cost of capital. In addition, we
generated $1.74 billion of liquidity from the portfolio and used the proceeds primarily to retire debt and reduce leverage. We made meaningful progress in resolving problem assets, primarily
evidenced by reductions in our non-performing loans and a significantly lower provision for loan losses. While we continue to incur significant costs repositioning and developing our
OREO/REHI assets, we believe that these investments should enhance the value of these assets and improve our ultimate returns.
Additionally, we maintained book value per common share, which increased slightly from the prior year. In the coming year we intend to continue to focus on preserving shareholder value by resolving
non-performing assets, strengthening the balance sheet through reduced leverage and better alignment of our asset and liability profile, and investing in our OREO/REHI portfolio. 
        For
the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a net loss of $22.1 million. Although this was a decrease from $79.6 million of net income in 2010, the results in
2010 included $270.4 million in gains primarily related to the sale of a large net lease asset portfolio as compared to $25.1 million of such gains in the current year. The provision for
loan losses decreased to $46.4 million in 2011 from $331.5 million in 2010, which resulted primarily from a reduction in non-performing loans. Our 2011 results also benefited
from a $43.2 million increase in income from equity method investments, due primarily to the sale of our interest in Oak Hill Advisors and a full year of earnings from our investment in LNR,
and the redemption of a series of senior secured notes, which resulted in a one-time gain of $109.0 million. 
        During
the year, non-performing loans decreased to $771.2 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $1.35 billion at December 31, 2010. In some
cases these loans were sold or modified and in many cases we took possession of properties serving as collateral for these loans through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure. These foreclosed assets constitute the majority of our real estate investment portfolio, which has increased to $1.91 billion as of December 31, 2011, from
$1.58 billion at the end of 2010. The overall increase in this portfolio was driven primarily by new REHI assets that we took title to during the year, offset by net reductions in OREO due to
asset sales. We generally seek to reposition and redevelop assets within this portfolio through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management, with the objective of maximizing their value.
While we work on repositioning and redeveloping these assets, we expect to continue to incur significant costs. These costs, net of REHI revenues, totaled $42.0 million in 2011 and
$41.5 million in 2010. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated a total of $1.74 billion in proceeds from our portfolio, comprised of $1.21 billion in loan principal
repayments and $534.6 million from asset sales. These proceeds were used in part to reduce our debt obligations by $1.51 billion. In March 2011, we entered into a $2.95 billion
senior secured credit facility and used the proceeds to repay approximately 
32



 
Table of Contents
$2.62 billion
of outstanding borrowings under our existing secured credit facilities, which were due to mature in June 2011 and June 2012, and approximately $300.0 million of unsecured
debt. Additionally, we funded a total of $216.3 million in new and pre-existing investments. The new investments we made in 2011 were primarily sourced from our existing portfolio.
We believe that making additional investments in assets within our portfolio may present more attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities than are otherwise available in the market, due
to our existing relationships with the customers and knowledge of the assets. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.60 billion of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before December 31, 2012. Of this
amount, $211.6 million represents the minimum amortization payable by December 31, 2012 under the Secured Credit Facility, which is collateralized by assets with a carrying value of
$3.08 billion. We expect to use proceeds from repayments and sales of the pledged collateral to meet these amortization payments. The remaining $1.38 billion of maturities represent
unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature during 2012, including $263.5 million in March, $336.5 million in June and $784.8 million in October. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had unrestricted cash of $356.8 million and other unencumbered assets with a carrying value of $3.69 billion. Our capital sources to meet
our unsecured debt maturities in the coming year will primarily include debt refinancings, proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments from borrowers, and may include equity capital raising
transactions. We believe that proceeds from these activities will be sufficient to meet our obligations during the remainder of the year; however, the timing and amounts of proceeds from expected
asset repayments and sales, and our ability to consummate debt refinancing and equity capital raising transactions are subject to factors outside of our control and cannot be predicted with certainty.
As discussed further in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below, our plans are dynamic and we may adjust our plans in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. 
        On
February 28, 2012, we announced the launch of a syndication of up to $900.0 million in new senior secured credit facilities. We expect the facilities to be comprised of
two tranches, maturing in 2016 and 2017, with differing interest rates. Outstanding borrowings under the facilities will be collateralized by a pool of diversified collateral, including loans, net
lease assets and other real estate assets. The proceeds from the new credit facilities will be used to refinance our 2012 unsecured debt maturities. We are in the process of syndicating the new
facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to complete the syndication.

         RevenueThe decrease in interest income is primarily due to a decline in the average balance of performing loans to $2.58 billion for the
year
ended December 31, 2011 from $3.92 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in performing loans was primarily due to loan repayments and sales as well as
performing loans moving to non-performing status (see
Risk Management below). For the year ended December 31, 2011, performing loans generated a weighted average effective yield of 7.20% as compared to 7.85% in 2010. The decrease was partially
offset by $26.3 million of interest income recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, related to certain non-performing loans that were resolved, including interest
not previously recorded due to the loans being on non-accrual status. 
        Within
our other income, revenue from REHI assets increased to $35.3 million in 2011 from $23.1 million in 2010 due to additional REHI assets acquired during the last
12 months. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received title to properties in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans of which $396.2 million
were classified as REHI. This increase in other income was almost entirely offset by lower loan prepayment fees received in the current year. 
         Costs and expensesOur total costs and expenses were impacted most significantly by lower provisions for loan losses. The decline in our
provisions
for loan losses primarily resulted from fewer loans moving to non-performing status and a lower overall balance of non-performing loans during the year ended
December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. Additionally, repayments and sales of performing loans resulted in a lower portfolio balance leading to a reduction in the required general loan loss
reserve. (See Risk Management below.) 
        General
and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs from both staffing reductions and reduced annual cash compensation offset by
additional stock-based compensation expense resulting from the modification of our December 19, 2008 restricted stock units. See Item 8"Financial Statements and
Supplementary DataNote 13" for further details on the modification of the December 19, 2008 awards. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, general and administrative
expense declined by $14.8 million or 16.5% from the prior year. 
        Other
expense decreased during the year primarily due to lower legal fees and other unreimbursed expenses incurred relating to loans in our portfolio. 
        Offsetting
these declines in expenses was an increase in interest expense. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher interest rates on our Secured Credit Facility entered into
during 2011, partially offset by lower average outstanding borrowings. Our weighted average effective cost of debt increased to 5.24% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 3.73%
during 2010. The average outstanding balance of our debt declined to $6.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $9.16 billion for the year ended December 31,
2010. 
        Operating
costs for REHI and OREO were greater in 2011 than in 2010 due to an increase in the number of properties held in the current year. The increase in operating costs for net lease
assets was
primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense and lease expirations, offset by new lease commencements. 
        Impairments
of assets for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily consisted of $20.8 million of impairments on OREO assets. For the year ended December 31, 2010,
impairment of assets primarily included $19.1 million of impairments on OREO assets. Impairments in both periods were due to changes in market conditions. 
        Gain on early extinguishment of debt, netDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we fully redeemed our $312.3 million remaining
principal amount of 10% senior secured notes due June 2014, which resulted in a $109.0 million gain on early extinguishment of debt. This was offset by losses on extinguishment of debt related
to the acceleration of unamortized deferred fees and debt discount resulting from accelerated repayments of our secured credit facilities, including the Tranche A-1 facility. 
34



 
Table of Contents
        During
the same period in 2010, we retired $633.0 million par value of our senior secured and unsecured notes and we redeemed $282.3 million of senior secured notes.
Together, these transactions resulted in an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of $131.0 million. These gains were offset by $22.1 million of losses resulting from the
acceleration of unamortized deferred fees and debt discount in connection with the prepayments of our $1.0 billion First Priority Credit Agreement, which was due to mature in 2012, and our
$947.9 million non-recourse secured term loan and another secured term loan that were collateralized by net lease assets we sold during the period. 
         Earnings from equity method investmentsThe increase in earnings from equity method investments was primarily attributable to the sale of our
interests in Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. and related entities as well as a full year of earnings from our investment in LNR. In October 2011, we sold a substantial portion of our interests in Oak
Hill Advisors, L.P. and related entities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. Prior to the sale in October of 2011, we recorded $8.5 million of earnings from
our investments in the Oak Hill entities that were sold during the year ended December 31, 2011. We also recorded a full year of earnings from our investment in LNR, which was
$52.1 million higher than our partial year earnings in the prior year when the investment was made. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our share of earnings from LNR included
$19.2 million of nonrecurring income from the settlement of tax liabilities. These increases in earnings were partially offset by losses and lower returns recorded by certain of our strategic
investments, primarily due to weaker market performance as compared to 2010. 
         Income tax (expense) benefitThe income tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011 was comprised of $13.7 million of
deferred tax benefit offset by $9.0 million of current tax expense related to taxable income generated by assets held in our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). TRS entities generated income
subject to tax of $75.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including the gain on the sale of our investment in Oak Hill Advisors L.P. This income was offset by the utilization
of net operating loss carryforwards of $54.8 million which reduced our current tax expense by $20.0 million, to $9.0 million for the year. The $13.7 million
non-cash deferred tax benefit was due to the reversal of a deferred tax liability related to a difference in investment basis for our Oak Hill investments that were sold in October of
2011. 
         Discontinued operationsDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold net lease assets with an aggregate carrying value of
$34.4 million resulting in a net gain of $2.9 million. In 2011, we also resolved a contingent obligation related to the 2010 portfolio sale of 32 net lease assets, resulting in a gain of
$22.2 million (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6"). During the same period in 2010, we sold net lease assets, including a
portfolio of 32 net lease assets, and recognized an aggregate initial gain of $270.4 million. 
        Income
(loss) from discontinued operations includes operating results from net lease assets sold prior to December 31, 2011. We sold net lease assets with an aggregate carrying
value of $34.4 million during 2011 compared to $1.17 billion during 2010, which included the sale of a portfolio of 32 net lease assets. 
        Income from sales of residential propertyDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we also sold OREO assets with a carrying value of
$176.5 million. A portion of these were sales of residential property units from which we recorded income of $5.7 million.

         RevenueThe decrease in interest income is primarily a result of a decline in the balance of performing loans to $3.37 billion at
December 31, 2010 from $4.91 billion at December 31, 2009. The decline in performing loans was primarily driven by loan repayments and note sales as well as loans moving to
non-performing status. (See "Risk Management" below). 
        Operating
lease income from net lease assets decreased primarily due to a slight decrease in tenant occupancy rates and lower rent received as a result of lease restructurings. 
        Offsetting
these declines in revenue was an increase in other income primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue from REHI assets and loan prepayment fees received. Revenue from
REHI assets increased to $23.1 million in 2010 from $5.8 million in 2009 due to the increase in real estate assets held for investment. 
        Costs and expensesTotal costs and expenses decreased primarily due to lower provisions for loan losses. The decline in our provision for loan
losses
was primarily due to fewer loans moving to non-performing status during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in loans moving to
non-performing status during the year can be attributed to a smaller overall loan portfolio and improving economic conditions and credit environment. Additionally, loan repayments and
sales have led to a smaller performing loan asset base, which has resulted in a reduction in the required general loan loss reserve. (See "Risk Management" below.) 
        Impairment
of assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily consisted of $19.1 million of impairments on OREO assets. Asset impairments in 2009 were significantly
higher due to declining real estate values and distressed economic conditions. These impairments included $78.6 million of impairments on OREO assets, $19.1 on net lease assets,
$12.6 million on investment securities and $12.2 million on equity investments. 
        Interest
expense decreased primarily due to the repayment and retirement of debt during the last 12 months as well as the exchange of senior unsecured notes for new
second-lien senior secured notes 
36



 
Table of Contents
completed
in May 2009. The average outstanding balance of our debt declined to $9.16 billion at December 31, 2010 from $11.66 billion at December 31, 2009. In addition, the
weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased to 3.73% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 4.07% during the same period in 2009 primarily due to the repayment of higher
rate debt obligations. 
        Other
expense was lower primarily due to a $42.4 million charge incurred in 2009 pursuant to a settlement agreement under which we terminated a long-term lease for new
headquarters space and settled all disputes with the landlord. 
        The
decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.9 million of rent expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to a lease
for new headquarters space which was terminated in May 2009. Stock-based compensation expense also declined by $4.2 million primarily due to amortization of newer stock awards with lower values
than those granted in prior years. 
        The
increase in operating costs for REHI and OREO was primarily due to the increase in the number of assets held during 2010 as compared to in 2009. 
         Gain on early extinguishment of debt, netDuring 2010, we retired $633.0 million par value of our senior secured and unsecured notes and we
redeemed $282.3 million of senior secured notes. Together, these transactions resulted in an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of $131.0 million. These gains were offset by
$22.1 million associated with accelerating the unamortized deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in connection with the prepayments of our $1.00 billion First Priority Credit
Agreement, which was due to mature in June 2012, and our $947.9 million non-recourse secured term loan and another secured term loan that were each collateralized by net lease
assets we sold during the period. 
        During
2009, we retired $1.31 billion par value of our senior unsecured notes at discounts to par and recognized $439.4 million in gain on early extinguishment of debt.
Additionally, we completed our secured note exchange transactions and purchased $12.5 million of our outstanding senior floating rates notes in a cash tender offer, which resulted in an
aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of $107.9 million. 
        Earnings from equity method investmentsThe increase in earnings from equity method investments was primarily attributable to better overall market
performance that affected our strategic investments in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, during 2009 we recorded a $9.4 million non-cash out of period charge to recognize
losses from an equity method investment as a result of additional depreciation expense that should have been recorded at the equity method entity in prior periods. 
         Discontinued operationsDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold net lease assets, including a portfolio of 32 net lease assets, and
recognized aggregate gains of $270.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold four net lease assets and recognized aggregate gains of $12.4 million. 
        Income
(loss) from discontinued operations includes the operating results from those net lease assets sold during the period. Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2009 included
the net income from net lease assets sold offset by $14.4 million of impairments on those sold assets. 
 Adjusted EBITDA  
        In addition to net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss)
plus the sum of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, provision for loan losses, impairment of assets and stock-based compensation expense, less the gain/loss on early
extinguishment of debt, net. 
        We
believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to consider, in addition to net income (loss), as it may help investors evaluate core operating performance prior to interest expense,
income taxes and certain non-cash items. 
37




 










Table of Contents 
        Adjusted EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with
GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted EBITDA indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is an additional
measure for us to use to analyze how our business is performing. It should be noted that our manner of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by
other companies.

Explanatory Note:





(1)As

$557.1 million and $667.8 million, respectively. 

38



 
Table of Contents
         Non-Performing LoansWe designate loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) the loan becomes 90 days
delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt. As of December 31, 2011, we had
non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of $771.2 million. Our non-performing loans decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due
to transfers of non-performing loans to REHI and OREO as well as sales and repayments. 
         Watch List LoansDuring our quarterly loan portfolio assessments, loans are put on the watch list if deteriorating performance indicates they
warrant
a higher degree of monitoring and senior management attention. As of December 31, 2011, we had loans on the watch list (excluding non-performing loans) with an aggregate carrying value of
$136.0 million. 
         Reserve for Loan LossesThe reserve for loan losses was $646.6 million as of December 31, 2011, or 18.5% of the gross carrying value of
total loans, compared to $814.6 million or 15.1% at December 31, 2010. The change in the balance of the reserve was the result of $46.4 million of provisioning for loan losses,
reduced by $214.4 million of charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2011. Due to the continued volatility of the commercial real estate market, the process of
estimating collateral values and reserves continues to require us to use significant judgment. We currently believe there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the
loans. 
        The
reserve for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. An asset-specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair
value of the loan's collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan. As of December 31, 2011, asset-specific reserves decreased to $573.1 million compared to
$694.4 million at December 31, 2010, primarily due to charge-offs on assets that were sold or transferred to REHI and OREO. The decrease was partially offset by impairments
on new non-performing loans. 
        The
formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to
loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to
loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment
status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This
methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. We estimate loss rates
based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time
frames to evaluate loss experience. 
        The
general reserve was $73.5 million or 3.4% of the gross carrying value of performing loans as of December 31, 2011, compared to $120.2 million or 3.6% of the
gross carrying value of performing loans at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the balance of the general reserve was primarily due to the decrease in performing loans outstanding to
$2.16 billion as of December 31, 2011 from $3.37 billion as of December 31, 2010. The reduction in general reserves as a percentage of performing loans outstanding was primarily
attributable to an improvement in the weighted average risk ratings of performing loans outstanding to 3.29 at the end of the current period compared to 3.51 as of December 31, 2010. 
         Real Estate Held for Investment, net and Other Real Estate OwnedREHI and OREO consist of properties acquired through foreclosure or by
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. Properties are designated as REHI or OREO depending on our strategic plan to
realize the maximum value from the collateral received. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the 
39



 
Table of Contents
property
for a period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as REHI, and when we intend to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as OREO. As of
December 31,
2011 we had $1.23 billion of assets classified as REHI and $677.5 million as OREO. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $20.8 million
on OREO assets due to changing market conditions. The continued volatility of the commercial real estate market requires us to use significant judgment in estimating fair values of REHI and OREO
properties at the time of transfer and thereafter when events or circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. Additionally, we will continue to incur holding and operating costs related
to REHI and OREO assets while they are being marketed for sale or redeveloped and repositioned. The aggregate net operating and holding costs for REHI and OREO assets was $42.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

Table of Contents
        Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or customers related to our investments are engaged in similar business
activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly
affected by changes in economic conditions. We monitor various segments of our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risks. We believe the current portfolio is reasonably well
diversified and does not contain any significant concentration of credit risks. 
        Substantially
all of our net lease, REHI and OREO assets, as well as assets collateralizing our loans and other lending investments are located in the United States, with California
15.3% and Florida 11.0% representing the only significant concentrations (greater than 10.0%) as of December 31, 2011. Our portfolio contains significant concentrations in the following asset
types as of December 31, 2011: land 19.7%, apartment/residential 18.4%, retail 11.4% and office 10.2%. 
        We
underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and customers and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash
security deposits. Although our loans and other lending investments, net lease, REHI and OREO assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and customers operate in a variety of industries, to
the extent
we have a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or customer, the inability of that borrower or customer to make its payment could have an adverse
effect on us. As of December 31, 2011, our five largest borrowers or tenants of net lease assets collectively accounted for approximately 22.4% of our aggregate annualized interest and
operating lease revenue, of which no single customer accounts for more than 8.0%. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
        In March 2011, we entered into a $2.95 billion senior secured credit facility and used the proceeds to repay
$2.62 billion of outstanding borrowings under existing secured credit facilities, which were due to mature in June 2011 and 2012, and approximately $300.0 million of unsecured debt.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated a total of $1.74 billion in proceeds from our portfolio, including $1.21 billion in loan principal repayments and
$534.6 million from asset sales. With these proceeds, we have reduced our outstanding debt obligations to $5.84 billion as of December 31, 2011 from $7.35 billion at the
prior year end. This includes repayments of $538.4 million, as of December 31, 2011, on the A-1 Tranche of the senior secured credit facility which exceeds the $450.0 million
minimum amortization requirement due to be paid on or before June 30, 2012 and leaves $211.6 million to be paid on or before December 31, 2012. During the year, we repurchased
12.3 million shares of common stock for $78.5 million. In addition, we funded a total of $216.3 million of investments and paid preferred dividends totaling $42.3 million during
the year ended December 31, 2011. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.60 billion of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before December 31, 2012. Of this
amount, $211.6 million represents the minimum amortization payable by December 31, 2012 under the Secured Credit Facility, which is collateralized by assets with a carrying value of
$3.08 billion. We expect to use proceeds from repayments and sales of the pledged collateral to meet these amortization payments. The remaining $1.38 billion of maturing debt represents
unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature during 2012 as follows ($ in thousands):

coming
year will primarily include debt refinancings, proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments from borrowers, and may include equity capital raising transactions. We have identified unencumbered
assets with a carrying value of approximately $1.5 billion that we will use either as collateral for secured refinancings or will sell strategically during the year ending December 31, 2012. We
currently expect that the majority of such asset sales would occur during the second half of 2012. Based upon the dynamic nature of our assets and our liquidity plan and the time frame in which we
need to generate liquidity, the specific assets, nature of the transactions, timing and amount of asset sales and refinancing transactions could vary. We may also encounter difficulty in finding
buyers of assets or executing capital raising strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could impact our ability to make scheduled repayments on our outstanding debt. However, given our
unencumbered assets base and current market conditions, we believe that we have several options that can be reasonably and timely executed to enable us to repay our debt obligations during 2012 as
they come due. 
        The
timing and amounts of proceeds from expected asset repayments and sales, and our ability to consummate debt refinancing and equity capital raising transactions are subject to factors
outside our control and cannot be predicted with certainty. Our plans are dynamic and we may adjust our plans in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. In addition,
although there were early signs of improvement in the commercial real estate and credit markets beginning in 2010 and in 2011, such markets remain volatile and it is not possible for us to predict
whether these trends
will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results. If we fail to repay our obligations as they become due, it would be an event of default under the
relevant debt instruments, which could result in a cross-default and acceleration of our other outstanding debt obligations, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

lease obligations as of December 31, 2011 (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 9).

Table of Contents 
         Secured Credit FacilityIn March 2011, we entered into a new $2.95 billion Secured Credit Facility comprised of a $1.50 billion term
loan facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and maturing in June 2013 (the "Tranche A-1 Facility") and a $1.45 billion term loan facility bearing interest at
a rate of LIBOR plus 5.75% maturing in June 2014 (the "Tranche A-2 Facility"), together the "Secured Credit Facility." Both tranches include a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. The
Tranche A-1 Facility and Tranche A-2 Facility were issued at discounts to par of 1.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Proceeds from the Secured Credit Facility were used
to fully repay the $1.67 billion and $0.9 billion outstanding under our secured credit facilities, which were due to mature in June 2011 and June 2012, respectively, and to repay $175.0
million of our unsecured credit facilities due in June 2011. The remaining proceeds were used to repay other unsecured debt maturing in the first half of 2011. 
        The
Secured Credit Facility is collateralized by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets consisting of loan, net lease, OREO and REHI assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales
of collateral are applied to amortize the Secured Credit Facility. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments, fee
income and, under certain circumstances, additional amounts funded on assets serving as collateral are retained by us. The Tranche A-1 Facility requires that aggregate cumulative
amortization payments of not less than $200.0 million shall be made on or before December 30, 2011, not less than $450.0 million on or before June 30, 2012, not less than $750.0 million
on or before December 31, 2012 and not less than $1.50 billion on or before June 28, 2013. The Tranche A-2 Facility will begin amortizing six months after the
repayment in full of the Tranche A-1 Facility, such that not less than $150.0 million of cumulative amortization payments shall be made on or before the six month anniversary of
repayment of the A-1 Facility, with additional amortization payments of $150.0 million due on or before each six month anniversary thereafter, with any unpaid principal amounts due at
maturity in June 2014. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we used proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral to repay $538.4 million of the Tranche A-1 Facility.
These repayments exceeded the $450.0 million cumulative amortization required to be paid by June 30, 2012, leaving $211.6 million to be paid on or before December 31, 2012. Repayments of
the facility prior to scheduled amortization dates have resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, related to the acceleration of
discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $9.1 million pursuant to an agreement with a holder of our previously outstanding secured credit facilities. The amount
effectively reduced the par value that was repaid to the debtholder and was accounted for under ASC 470-60, resulting in $3.7 million being recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2011, as a gain on extinguishment of debt. As the same lender participated in the new Secured Credit Facility, the remaining amount was recorded as a premium to that facility and
will serve to reduce a portion of future interest expense as it is amortized through its maturity. 
        Unsecured Credit FacilitiesIn June 2011, we repaid the $329.9 million remaining principal balance of our LIBOR + 0.85% unsecured line
of credit. 
         Secured Term LoansIn June 2011, we entered into a $120.0 million secured term loan financing maturing in July 2021. This financing is
collateralized
by net lease properties occupied by a single tenant and bears interest at 5.05%. 
        In
March 2011, we refinanced the $47.7 million outstanding principal balance of a maturing secured term loan. In addition, during June 2011, we entered into an additional $4.6 million
secured term loan. These loans bear interest at LIBOR + 4.50%, mature in 2014 and are cross-collateralized by the same net lease assets. Simultaneously with the financings, we entered
into interest rate swaps to exchange the variable rates on the notes for fixed interest rates (see Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 12").

Table of Contents
        Secured NotesIn January 2011, we fully redeemed the $312.3 million remaining principal balance of our 10% 2014 Notes and recorded a gain on early
extinguishment of debt of $109.0 million primarily related to the recognition of the deferred gain premiums that resulted from the exchange. 
         Unsecured NotesDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we repaid, upon maturity, the $170.4 million outstanding principal balance of our
5.65% senior unsecured notes, the $96.9 million outstanding principal balance of our 5.125% senior unsecured notes and the $107.8 million outstanding principal balance of our 5.80% senior unsecured
notes. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased $97.2 million par value of our senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from September 2011 to October
2012. In connection with these repurchases, we recorded an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
         Unencumbered/Encumbered AssetsAs of December 31, 2011, we had unencumbered assets, including cash, with a gross carrying value of
$4.68 billion, gross of $707.3 million of accumulated depreciation and loan loss reserves, and encumbered assets with a carrying value of $3.53 billion. The carrying value of our
encumbered assets by asset type is as follows ($ in thousands):

         Debt CovenantsOur outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of
unencumbered
assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a restriction on debt incurrence based upon the effect of the debt incurrence on our fixed charge coverage. If any of our covenants are breached
and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the
bondholders. While we expect that our ability to incur new indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio will be limited for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be permitted to incur
indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures. 
        Our
Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with
affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, we are required to maintain collateral coverage of 1.25x outstanding
borrowings. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the Secured Credit Facility permits us to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis. We may not pay
common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT. 
        Our
Secured Credit Facility contains cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay
amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for
any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse
indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated.

Table of Contents
         DerivativesOur use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate hedges or other instruments to
manage
interest rate risk exposure and foreign exchange hedges to manage our risk to changes in foreign currencies. The principal objectives of such hedges are to minimize the risks and/or costs associated
with our operating and financial structure and to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements. As a result of the repayment of our secured credit facilities in March 2011 a portion of our
multi-currency borrowing capacity was extinguished. Accordingly, upon repayment of the facilities we simultaneously entered into foreign currency hedges to manage our exposure on foreign denominated
investment assets. See Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 12." 
        Off-Balance Sheet TransactionsWe are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. 
         Unfunded CommitmentsWe generally fund construction and development loans and build-outs of space in net lease assets over a period of
time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. We refer to these
arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or
addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion. We refer to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, we have committed to invest capital in
several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum amounts of the fundings we may make under each
category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that we approve all Discretionary Fundings and that 100% of our capital committed to
Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows (in thousands):

         Transactions with Related PartiesIn October 2011, we sold a substantial portion of our interests in Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. and related
entities for $183.7 million of net cash proceeds, which resulted in a net gain of $30.3 million. Additionally, prior to the sale we recorded $8.5 million of
earnings from these investments for the year ended December 31, 2011. Both the gain and earnings are included in "Earnings from equity method investments" on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The transaction was completed in part through sales of interests to unrelated third parties and in part through redemption of interests by principals of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P.,
including Glenn R. August. Mr. August serves as a member of our Board of Directors and is also the president and senior partner of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. In conjunction with the sale of
our interests in Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., we retained interests in our share of certain unearned incentive fees of various funds. These fees are contingent on the future performance of the
funds and we will recognize income related to these fees if and when the amounts are realized. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had investments in non-controlling interests of Oak Hill funds, which were not included in the sale, with a carrying value of $58.7
million. Mr. August holds an investment in these same entities. We recorded equity in earnings from these investments of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
        We
have an equity interest of approximately 24% in LNR Property Corporation ("LNR") and two of our executive officers serve on LNR's board of managers. During the year ended
December 31, 2010, we 
45

executed
the discounted payoff of a $25.0 million principal value loan with LNR for which we received proceeds of $24.5 million in full repayment. 
         Stock Repurchase ProgramOn August 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up
to
$65.0 million of our Common Stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. When aggregated with the $14.1 million remaining
authorization from previous repurchase programs, we had $79.1 million of our Common Stock available for repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2011. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 12.3 million shares of our outstanding Common Stock for approximately $78.5 million, at an average cost of $6.43 per share,
and repurchases were recorded at cost. As of December 31, 2011, we had $0.6 million of Common Stock available to repurchase under our Board authorized stock repurchase programs. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates  
        The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain
circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry
experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and,
therefore, routinely require adjustment. 
        During
2011, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in
Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplemental DataNote 3." The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates
and judgments: 
        Reserve for loan lossesThe reserve for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance
sheet date. The reserve is increased through the "Provision for loan losses" on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and is decreased by charge-offs when losses are confirmed through
the receipt of assets such as cash in a pre-foreclosure sale or via ownership control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or when significant
collection efforts have ceased. We have determined we have one portfolio segment, represented by commercial real estate lending, whereby we utilize a uniform process for determining our reserves for
loan losses. The reserve for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component. 
        The
general reserve component covers performing loans and reserves for loan losses are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is
probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default
probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this
assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and
relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral,
collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk
rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from "1" to "5" with "1" representing the lowest risk of loss and "5" representing the
highest risk of loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into 
46



 
Table of Contents
account
current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience. 
        The
asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that
it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on a loan-by-loan basis each quarter
based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and
regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, or the estimated fair value of the
collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 
        Substantially
all of our impaired loans are collateral dependent and impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. We generally use the income
approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, we obtain external "as is" appraisals for loan collateral,
generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if
circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate. 
        A
loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). A TDR occurs when we grant a concession and the debtor is experiencing financial
difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan. 
        The
provisions for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $46.4 million, $331.5 million and $1.26 billion, respectively. The
total reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010, included asset specific reserves of $573.1 million and $694.4 million, respectively, and general reserves of
$73.5 million and $120.2 million, respectively. 
         Impairment of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securitiesFor
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt
securities held in "Loans and other lending investments, net" management evaluates whether the asset is other-than-temporarily impaired when the fair market value is below
carrying value. We consider debt securities other-than-temporarily impaired if (1) we have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that we
will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If it is determined that an
other-than-temporary impairment exists, the portion related to credit losses, where we do not expect to recover our entire amortized cost basis, will be recognized as an
"Impairment of assets" on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security, but the
security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be separated. The credit loss component of the impairment will be recorded as an "Impairment of assets" on our Consolidated Statements
of Operations, and the remainder will be recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we determined that unrealized credit related losses on certain held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporary and recorded impairment charges totaling $11.7 million, in "Impairment of assets" on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Table of Contents 
         Real estate held for investment, net and Other real estate ownedREHI and OREO consist of properties acquired through foreclosure or by
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. Properties are designated as REHI or OREO depending on our strategic plan to
realize the maximum value from the collateral received. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the property for a period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as REHI, and when we
intend to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as OREO. 
        REHI
assets are initially recorded at their estimated fair value. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over the fair value of the property is charged-off against the
reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained. Upon acquisition, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values. We consider REHI
assets to be long-lived and periodically review them for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable.
Impairment of REHI assets is measured in the same manner as long-lived assets as described below. 
        OREO
assets are recorded at the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over the fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell is
charged-off against the reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained. 
        We
review the recoverability of an OREO asset's carrying value when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a property's value. If impairment exists a loss is recorded
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property less cost to sell. 
        During
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received titles to properties in satisfaction of senior mortgage loans with cumulative gross carrying values of
$617.8 million, $1.41 billion and $1.88 billion, respectively, for which those properties had served as collateral, and recorded charge-offs totaling
$115.3 million, $631.9 million and $573.6 million, respectively, related to these loans. Subsequent to taking title to the properties, we determined certain OREO assets were
impaired due to changing market conditions, and recorded impairment charges of $20.8 million, $19.1 million and $78.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively. 
         Long-lived assets impairment testNet lease assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair
value less costs to sell and are included in "Assets held for sale" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will
be recorded as an impairment charge and included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Once the asset is classified as held for sale,
depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        We
periodically review long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
assets may not be recoverable. A held for use long-lived asset's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected
future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess
of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of net lease and REHI assets are recorded in "Impairment
of assets," on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        During
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairment charges on net lease assets of $6.1 million and $33.5 million, respectively, due to changes
in market conditions, of which $6.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, were included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations."

Table of Contents
         Identified intangible assets and goodwillWe record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair values separate and apart from goodwill. We
determine whether such intangible assets have finite or indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2011, all such acquired intangible assets have finite lives. We amortize finite lived intangible
assets based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. We review finite lived intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable we will
record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments of intangibles are recorded in "Impairment of assets" on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. 
        The
excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as
goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment
test is done at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the
fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 
         Valuation of deferred tax assetsDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets
and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax
assets and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be
realized. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing
and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires us
to forecast our business and general economic environment in future periods. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any are included in "Income tax (expense) benefit" on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Based
on our assessment of all factors, we determined that a valuation allowance of $50.9 million was required on our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011. 
         ConsolidationVariable interest entitiesWe evaluate our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if our interests
constitute variable interests in a variable interest entity ("VIE") and if we are the primary beneficiary. There is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a
VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. We first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment, including, but not limited to, which interests
create or absorb variability, contractual terms, the key decision making powers, either impact on the VIE's economic performance and related party relationships. An iterative quantitative analysis is
required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a VIE or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. 
         Fair value of assets and liabilitiesThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is
dependent
upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable
market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate
fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary
market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore,

when
market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.

Item 8"Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 16" for a complete discussion on how we determine fair value of financial and
non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.

    Item 7a.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     
 Market Risks  
        Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and
equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest
and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the
financial markets will affect the spread between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to the impact of interest rate floors and caps, as well as the amounts of floating
rate assets and liabilities. Any significant compression of the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. 
        In
the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or further economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely
affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In
addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. 
        Interest
rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors
beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates
on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific
transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge
against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers. 
        While
a REIT may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating
non-qualifying income, use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non-qualified income for REIT income test purposes. This includes hedging asset related risks such as
credit, foreign exchange and prepayment or interest rate exposure on our loan assets. As a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited. There can be no assurance that our profitability
will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates. 
        The
following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income should interest rates increase by 50 or 100 basis points and decrease by 10 basis points, assuming no change
in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). Net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and earnings from
equity method investments, less interest expense and operating costs on net lease assets for the year ended December 31, 2011. The base interest rate scenario assumes the one-month
LIBOR rate of 0.30% as of December 31, 2011. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.

Explanatory Note:





(1)We
have a net variable-rate debt exposure resulting in an increase in net investment income when rates decrease and a decrease in net investment
income when rates increase. In addition, interest rate floors on certain of our loan assets further increase net investment income as rates decrease and decrease net investment income when rates
increase. As of December 31, 2011, $400.7 million of our floating rate loans has a weighted average interest rate floor of 3.16% and $2.39 billion of our floating rate debt has a
weighted average interest rate floor of 1.25%.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of iStar Financial Inc.: 
        In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of iStar Financial Inc. and
its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
        The
Company has approximately $1.6 billion of debt maturing in 2012. As further described in Note 10, the Company's capital sources to meet its debt maturities are expected
to primarily include debt refinancings, proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments from borrowers and may include equity capital raising transactions. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    iStar Financial Inc.         Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     
 Note 1Business and Organization  
         BusinessiStar Financial Inc., or the "Company," is a fully-integrated finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate
industry. The Company provides custom-tailored investment capital to high-end private and corporate owners of real estate and invests directly across a range of real estate sectors. The
Company, which is taxed as a real estate investment trust, or "REIT," has invested more than $35 billion over the the past two decades. The Company's three primary business segments are
lending, net leasing and real estate investment. See Note 10 for discussion of business risks and uncertainties, including the impact of recent economic conditions on the Company and the
Company's liquidity and capital resources. 
         OrganizationThe Company began its business in 1993 through private investment funds and became publicly traded in 1998. Since that time, the Company
has grown through the origination of new lending and leasing transactions, as well as through corporate acquisitions. 
 Note 2Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  
        Basis of PresentationThe accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
        Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to conform to the current period presentation. 
         Principles of ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries,
controlled partnerships and variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 
         Consolidated VIEsThe Company consolidates OHA Strategic Credit Fund Parallel I, L.P. ("OHA SCF"), which was created to invest in
distressed and undervalued loans, bonds, equities and other investments. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, OHA SCF had $56.9 million and $45.7 million, respectively, of total assets, no
debt, and $0.1 million of noncontrolling interests. The investments held
by this entity are presented in "Other investments" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total unfunded commitment of $16.9 million to
this entity. 
        The
Company also consolidates Madison Deutsche Andau Holdings, LP ("Madison DA"), which was created to invest in mortgage loans collateralized by real estate in Europe. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, Madison DA had $37.4 million and $58.0 million, respectively, of total assets, no debt, and $5.4 million and $8.6 million of noncontrolling
interests, respectively. The investments held by this entity are presented in "Loans and other lending investments, net" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
         Unconsolidated VIEsThe Company determined that as of December 31, 2011, 28 of its other investments were in VIEs where it is not the primary
beneficiary and accordingly the VIEs have not been consolidated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2011, the

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Note 2Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation (Continued) 
Company's
maximum exposure to loss from these investments does not exceed the sum of the $220.2 million carrying value of the investments and $7.4 million of related unfunded commitments. 
 Note 3Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
         Loans and other lending investments, netLoans and other lending investments, net includes the following investments: senior mortgages, subordinate
mortgages, corporate/partnership loans and other lending investments-securities. Management considers nearly all of its loans and debt securities to be held-for-investment or
held-to-maturity, although certain investments may be classified as held-for-sale or available-for-sale. 
        Loans
classified as held-for-investment or held-to-maturity are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance, and include
unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and unamortized deferred loan costs or fees. These loans also include accrued and paid-in-kind interest and accrued exit fees that
the Company determines are probable of being collected. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in "Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
        Loans
and other lending investments designated for sale are classified as held for sale and are carried at lower of amortized historical cost or fair value. The amount by which carrying
value exceeds fair value is recorded as a valuation allowance. Subsequent changes in the valuation allowance are included in the determination of net income (loss) in the period in which the change
occurs. 
        For
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities held in "Loans and other lending investments, net," management evaluates
whether the asset is other-than-temporarily impaired when the fair market value is below carrying value. The Company considers debt securities other-than-temporarily impaired
if (1) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3) it does not expect to
recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If it is determined that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the portion related to credit losses, where the
Company does not expect to recover its entire amortized cost basis, will be recognized as an "Impairment of assets" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. If the Company does not
intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be
separated. The credit loss component of the impairment will be recorded as an "Impairment of assets" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the remainder will be recorded in
"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
         Net lease assets and depreciationNet lease assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Certain improvements and replacements are
capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset. Repairs and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method of cost recovery over the shorter of estimated useful lives or 40 years for facilities, five years for furniture and equipment, the
shorter of the remaining lease term or expected life for tenant improvements and the remaining useful life of the facility for facility improvements. 
        Net
lease assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in "Assets held for sale" on the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value, the difference will be

recorded
as an impairment charge and included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Once an asset is classified as held for sale,
depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        The
Company periodically reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable. The value of a long-lived asset held for use is impaired only if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as
expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as
the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of net lease assets that are not held for sale
are recorded in "Impairment of assets," on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        The
Company accounts for its acquisition of facilities by allocating the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair
values. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings, building improvements and tenant improvements is determined as if these assets are vacant. Intangible assets may include the
value of above-market or below-market, in-place leases and the value of customer relationships, which are each recorded at their relative estimated fair values. 
        The
capitalized above-market (or below-market) lease value is amortized as a reduction of (or, increase to) operating lease income over the remaining non-cancelable term of
each lease plus any renewal periods with fixed rental terms that are considered to be below-market. The Company also generally engages in sale/leaseback transactions and typically executes leases with
the occupant simultaneously with the purchase of the net lease asset at market-rate rents. As such, no above-market or below-market lease value is ascribed to these transactions. 
        Real estate held for investment, netReal estate held for investment, net ("REHI") consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or through
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans that the Company intends to hold, operate or develop for a period of at least
12 months. REHI assets are initially recorded at their estimated fair value. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over the estimated fair value of the property acquired is
charged-off against the reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained. Additionally, upon acquisition of a property, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values and depreciation is computed, all in the same manners as described in "Net lease assets and depreciation" above. 
        Subsequent
to acquisition, qualified development and construction costs, including interest and certain other carrying costs incurred during the construction and/or renovation periods
are capitalized and charged to operations through depreciation over the asset's estimated useful life. The Company ceases capitalization on the portions substantially completed and capitalizes only
those costs associated with the portions under development. 
        The
Company considers REHI assets to be long-lived and periodically reviews them for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may

not
be recoverable. The Company measures impairments for REHI assets in the same manner as net lease assets, as described in "Net lease assets and depreciation" above. Impairments of REHI assets are
recorded in "Impairment of assets," on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Operating
revenues related to REHI assets are recorded as "Other income" and expenses are included in "Operating costsREHI and OREO," on the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 
         Other real estate ownedOREO consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of
non-performing loans that the Company intends to market for sale in the near term. OREO is recorded at the estimated fair
value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged-off against the reserve for loan losses
when title to the property is obtained. Net revenues and costs of holding the property are recorded as "Operating costsREHI and OREO" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Significant property improvements may be capitalized to the extent that the carrying value of the property does not exceed its estimated fair value less costs to sell. 
        The
Company reviews the recoverability of an OREO asset's carrying value when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a property's value. If impairment exists, a loss
is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell. These impairments are recorded in "Impairment of assets" on the Company's
Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Profits
on sales of residential properties are recognized upon closing of the sale when all conditions for full profit recognition have been met. The Company uses the relative sales
value method to allocate costs to individual residential properties. Profits on sales of residential properties are included in "Income from sales of residential property" on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 
         Equity and cost method investmentsPurchased equity interests are accounted for pursuant to the equity method of accounting if the Company can
significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an investee. This is generally presumed to exist when ownership interest is between 20% and 50% of a corporation, or greater than 5% of
a limited partnership or limited liability company. The Company's periodic share of earnings and losses in equity method investees is included in "Earnings from equity method investments" on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the Company's ownership position is too small to provide such influence, the cost method is used to account for the equity interest. Equity and cost method
investments are included in "Other investments" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
        The
Company periodically reviews equity method investments for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may
not be recoverable. The Company will record an impairment charge to the extent that the estimated fair value of an investment is less than its carrying value and the Company determines the impairment
is other-than-temporary. Impairment charges are recorded in "Impairment of assets" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
         Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks or invested in money market funds with original maturity terms of less
than 90 days.

        Restricted cashRestricted cash represents amounts required to be maintained under certain of the Company's debt obligations, lending investments,
OREO, leasing and derivative transactions. 
         ConsolidationVariable interest entitiesThe Company evaluated its investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if they
constitute variable interests in a VIE. A VIE is an entity where a controlling financial interest is achieved through means other than voting rights. A VIE is consolidated by the primary beneficiary,
which is the party that has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE
that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This overall consolidation assessment includes a review of, among other factors, which interests create or absorb variability, contractual terms, the
key decision making powers, their impact on the VIE's economic performance, and related party relationships. Where qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the Company performs a quantitative
analysis. The Company reassesses its evaluation of the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis and assesses its evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon certain reconsideration events. 
        The
Company has investments in certain funds that meet the deferral criteria in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-10 and will continue to assess consolidation
of these entities under the overall guidance on the consolidation of VIEs in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810-10. The consolidation evaluation is similar to the process
noted above, except that the primary beneficiary is the party that will receive a majority of the VIE's anticipated losses, a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, or both. In addition, for
entities that meet the deferral criteria, the Company reassesses its initial evaluation of the primary beneficiary and whether an entity is a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
         Deferred expensesDeferred expenses include leasing costs and financing fees. Leasing costs include brokerage, legal and other costs which are
amortized over the life of the respective leases. External fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing have been deferred and are amortized over the term of the respective
borrowing using the effective interest method or the straight line method, as appropriate. Amortization of leasing costs and deferred financing fees are included in "Depreciation and amortization" and
"Interest expense," respectively, on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
         Identified intangible assets and goodwillUpon the acquisition of a business, the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair
values separate and apart from goodwill. The Company determines whether such intangible assets have finite or indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2011, all such intangible assets acquired by
the Company have finite lives. The Company amortizes finite lived intangible assets based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows
of the business acquired. The Company reviews finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If
the Company determines the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable it will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments
of intangible assets are recorded in "Impairment of assets" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $53.6 million and $42.8 million, respectively, of unamortized finite lived intangible assets primarily related to
the prior acquisition of net lease assets and REHI. The total amortization expense for these intangible assets was $11.0 million, $9.0 million and

        The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and
liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. The impairment test is done at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Fair values for goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets are determined
using the market approach, income approach or cost approach, as appropriate. 
         Revenue recognitionThe Company's revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
         Loans and other lending investments:    Interest income on loans and other lending investments is recognized on an accrual basis using the
interest
method. 
        On
occasion, the Company may acquire loans at premiums or discounts. These discounts and premiums in addition to any deferred costs or fees, are typically amortized over the contractual
term of the loan
using the interest method. Exit fees are also recognized over the lives of the related loans as a yield adjustment, if management believes it is probable that such amounts will be received. If loans
with premiums, discounts, loan origination or exit fees are prepaid, the Company immediately recognizes the unamortized portion, which is included in "Other income" on the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 
        The
Company considers a loan to be non-performing and places loans on non-accrual status at such time as: (1) the loan becomes 90 days delinquent;
(2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. While
on non-accrual status, based on the Company's judgment as to collectability of principal, loans are either accounted for on a cash basis, where interest income is recognized only upon
actual receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, where all cash receipts reduce a loan's carrying value. Non-accrual loans are returned to accrual status when a loan has
become contractually current. 
        Certain
of the Company's loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates that differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject
to management's determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. 
        Prepayment
penalties or yield maintenance payments from borrowers are recognized as additional income when received. Certain of the Company's loan investments provide for additional
interest based on 
65



 
Table of Contents

iStar Financial Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Note 3Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
the
borrower's operating cash flow or appreciation of the underlying collateral. Such amounts are considered contingent interest and are reflected as interest income only upon receipt of cash. 
        The
Company holds certain loans initially acquired at a discount, for which it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be received. The Company
does not have a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected on these loans and recognizes income when cash is received or applies cash to reduce the
carrying value of the loans. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, these loans had cumulative principal balances of $74.5 million and $93.6 million, respectively, and cumulative carrying values of
$59.6 million and $75.9 million, respectively. 
         Leasing investments:    The Company's leases have all been determined to be operating leases based on an analysis performed in accordance
with
ASC 840. Operating lease revenue is recognized on the straight-line method of accounting, generally from the later of the date the lessee takes posession of the space and it is
ready for its intended use or the date of acquisition of the facility subject to existing leases. Accordingly, contractual lease payment increases are recognized evenly over the term of the lease. The
periodic difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as "Deferred operating lease income receivable," on the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets. 
         Reserve for loan lossesThe reserve for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance
sheet date. The reserve is increased through the "Provision for loan losses" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and is decreased by charge-offs when losses are
confirmed through the receipt of assets such as cash in a pre-foreclosure sale or via ownership control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or
when significant collection efforts have ceased. The Company has determined it has one portfolio segment, represented by commercial real estate lending, whereby it utilizes a uniform process for
determining its reserve for loan losses. The reserve for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component. 
        The
general reserve component covers performing loans and reserves for loan losses are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is
probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default
probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during the Company's quarterly loan portfolio assessment.
During this assessment, the Company performs a comprehensive analysis of its loan portfolio and assigns risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality
based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. The Company considers, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and
investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk
classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from "1" to "5" with "1" representing the lowest risk of loss
and "5" representing the highest risk of loss. The Company estimates loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within its portfolio and takes into account current economic conditions
affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Note 3Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
        The
asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans. The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it
believes that it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on a
loan-by-loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project
economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received,
observable market prices, or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 
        Substantially
all of the Company's impaired loans are collateral dependent and impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. The Company
generally uses the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Company obtains external "as
is" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated
non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate
markets rapidly deteriorate. 
        A
loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). A TDR occurs when the Company has granted a concession and the debtor is
experiencing financial difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original
loan. 
         Allowance for doubtful accountsThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's estimate of losses inherent in the accrued operating lease
income receivable and deferred operating lease income receivable balances as of the balance sheet date and incorporates an asset-specific component, as well as a general, formula-based reserve based
on management's evaluation of the credit risks associated with these receivables. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.7 million and
$1.4 million, respectively. 
        Derivative instruments and hedging activityThe Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, a hedge of
a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability. 
        Derivatives,
such as foreign currency hedges and interest rate caps, that are not designated hedges are considered economic hedges, with changes in fair value reported in current
earnings in "Other
expense" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading purposes.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  
 Note 3Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  
        Stock-based compensationCompensation cost for stock-based awards is measured on the grant date and adjusted over the period of the employees'
services to reflect (i) actual forfeitures and (ii) the outcome of awards with performance or service conditions through the requisite service
period. The Company recognizes compensation cost for performance-based awards if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Compensation cost
for market condition-based awards is determined using a Monte Carlo model to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company's Common Stock, which is reflected in the grant date fair
value. All compensation cost for market-condition based awards in which the service conditions are met is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Compensation costs are
recognized ratably over the applicable vesting/service period and recorded in "General and administrative" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
         Disposal of long-lived assetsThe results of operations from net lease assets that were sold or held for sale in the current and prior
periods are classified as "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations even though such income was actually recognized by the Company prior to
the asset sale. Gains from the sale of net lease assets are classified as "Gain from discontinued operations" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Income taxesThe Company has elected to be qualified and taxed as a REIT under section 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"). The Company is subject to federal income taxation at corporate rates on its REIT taxable income, however, the Company is allowed a deduction for the amount of dividends paid to
its shareholders, thereby subjecting the distributed net income of the Company to taxation at the shareholder level only. In addition, the Company is allowed several other deductions in computing its
REIT taxable income, including non-cash items such as depreciation expense and certain specific reserve amounts that the Company deems to be uncollectable. These deductions allow the
Company to shelter a portion of its operating cash flow from its dividend payout requirement under federal tax laws. In addition, the Company has made foreclosure elections for certain properties
acquired through foreclosure which allows the Company to operate these properties within the REIT but subjects them to certain tax obligations. The carrying value of assets with foreclosure elections
as of December 31, 2011 is $1.38 billion. The Company intends to operate in a manner consistent with and to elect to be treated as a REIT for tax purposes. As of December 31,
2010, the Company had $153.7 million of net operating loss carryforwards at the corporate REIT level, which can generally be used to offset both ordinary and capital taxable income in future
years and will expire through 2030 if unused. The amount of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2011 will be subject to finalization of the 2011 tax returns. The Company
recognizes interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as "Income tax (expense) benefit" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        The
Company can participate in certain activities from which it was previously precluded in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, as long as these activities are conducted in
entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), is engaged in various
real estate related opportunities, including but not limited to managing various investments in equity affiliates, including Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. and LNR, and managing activities related to certain
foreclosed assets. As of December 31, 2011, $770.7 million of the Company's assets were owned by TRS entities. The Company's
TRS entities are not consolidated for federal income tax purposes and are taxed as corporations. For financial reporting

(1)During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold its investment in Oak Hill Advisors L.P. (see Note 7) and recognized a deferred tax
benefit resulting from the reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with the investment. See the table on the following page for the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010. 

        During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company's TRS entities had income subject to tax of $75.8 million which was offset by
$54.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards, generating current tax expense of $9.0 million. The Company's TRS taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2011 included
the gain on the Company's sale of its investment in Oak Hill Advisors L.P. (see Note 7). The Company's utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $54.8 million offset this
taxable income and reduced current tax expense by approximately $20.0 million. The Company also had TRS entities which generated $36.9 million of aggregate taxable losses during the year ended
December 31, 2011. Total cash paid for taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $8.5 million, $7.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. 
        Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the
available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of its deferred
tax assets, the Company considers, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning
strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general
economic environment in future periods. Based on an assessment of all factors, including historical losses and continued volatility of the activities within the TRS entities, it was determined that
valuation allowances of $50.9 million and $29.9 million were required on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Changes in estimate of
deferred tax asset realizability, if any are included in "Income tax (expense) benefit" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)Deferred
tax assets primarily include net operating loss carryforwards of $22.8 million and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively, as well as real estate asset basis differences of $30.8 million and $8.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(2)Deferred
tax liabilities are primarily comprised of basis differences in equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company
sold its investment in Oak Hill Advisors L.P. (see Note 7) and recognized the deferred tax benefit associated with the reversal of this deferred liability. 

         Earnings per shareThe Company uses the two-class method in calculating EPS when it issues securities other than common stock that
contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, the company declares dividends on its common stock. Vested HPU shares are entitled to dividends
of the Company when dividends are declared. Basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") for the Company's Common Stock and HPU shares are computed by dividing net income allocable to common shareholders
and HPU holders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and HPU shares outstanding for the period, respectively. Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") is calculated similarly,
however, it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, where such exercise or conversion
would result in a lower earnings per share amount. 
        Unvested
share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are deemed a ("Participating Security")
and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company's unvested restricted stock units with rights to dividends and common stock
equivalents issued under its Long-Term Incentive Plans are considered participating securities and have been included in the two-class method when calculating EPS. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements  
        In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05,
"Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which requires entities to (1) present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but
consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income and (2) present reclassification of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. In December 2011, the
FASB issued ASU 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting
Standards Update No. 2011-05," which deferred the requirements of entities to present reclassification of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. Both

years beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The Company will adopt this ASU for the reporting period ending March 31, 2012, as required. 
        In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs." This ASU is a
result of joint efforts by the FASB and IASB to develop a single, converged framework on how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. This ASU is largely
consistent with existing fair value measurement principles of U.S. GAAP, however, it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. The Company will adopt this ASU for the reporting period ending March 31, 2012, as
required. 
        In
April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, "A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring," which provides additional guidance to
creditors for determining whether a loan modification is a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). The guidance provides additional considerations in determining whether a creditor has granted a
concession and adds factors for creditors to consider in determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. This ASU was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on
or after June 15, 2011 with retrospective application for loan modifications that have occurred from January 1, 2011. Loan modifications that qualify as TDRs are considered impaired and
will be measured and recorded prospectively in the period of adoption. The Company adopted the standard in the period ended September 30, 2011, as required. As a result of this adoption, the
Company reassessed all restructurings that occurred on or after January 1, 2011 for identification as troubled debt restructurings. As of September 30, 2011, the Company had a recorded
investment of $50.9 million in loans for which the allowance for credit losses was previously measured under a general allowance for credit losses methodology and became specifically reviewed
for impairment as a result of adoption of this ASU. Based on an evaluation of potential losses at September 30, 2011, no specific reserves were required for these loans. See Note 4 for
additional troubled debt restructuring disclosures. 
        In
January 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011-01, "Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. 2010-20," which
temporarily deferred the effective date in ASU 2010-20, "Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses" in respect of disclosures
related to troubled debt restructurings until FASB finalized ASU 2010-20 (see above). ASU 2010-20 requires companies to provide disaggregated levels of disclosure by portfolio
segment and class to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings. The Company adopted the TDR disclosure provisions of ASU
2010-20 in the period ended September 30, 2011, as required. See Note 4 for additional disclosures required by the adoption of these provisions.

        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company restructured seven loans that were considered troubled debt restructurings. The Company reduced the rate on
three of these loans with a combined recorded investment of $105.7 million, from a combined weighted average rate of 8.3% to 4.7% and extended the loans with a new weighted average maturity of
1.4 years, with conditional extension options in certain cases dependent on pay down hurdles. The Company extended a discounted payoff option on one loan that is currently classified as
non-performing and extended the term of the three remaining loans with the interest rates unchanged. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, the Company had $6.1 million of
unfunded commitments on modified loans considered troubled debt restructurings. 
        For
the six loans that were extended, the Company believes the borrowers can perform under the new terms and has classified these loans as performing. Generally when granting financial
concessions, the Company will seek to protect its position by requiring incremental pay downs, additional collateral or guarantees and in some cases lookback features or equity kickers to offset
concessions granted should conditions with the loan improve. 
        The
Company's determination of credit losses is impacted by troubled debt restructurings whereby loans that have gone through troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired and
assessed for specific reserves and are not included in the Company's assessment of general reserves. Loans previously restructured under troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default are
reassessed to incorporate the Company's current assumptions on expected cash flows and additional provision expense is recorded to the extent necessary. 
 Note 5Real Estate Held for Investment, net and Other Real Estate Owned

 Explanatory Notes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 








(1)The
Company records its investment in LNR on a one quarter lag, therefore, amounts in the Company's financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2011 are based on balances and results from LNR for the year ended September 30, 2011.
(2)LNR
consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligation trusts that are considered VIEs (and for which it is the
primary beneficiary), that have been excluded from the amounts presented above. As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, the assets of these trusts which aggregate approximately
$126.66 billion and $142.39 billion, respectively, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which aggregate approximately $126.64 billion and
$141.99 billion, respectively, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including the Company. In addition, Total revenue presented above includes $119.0 million
and $16.8 million for the periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of servicing fee revenue that is eliminated upon consolidation of the VIE's. This income is then added
back through consolidation as an adjustment to income allocable to noncontrolling entities and has no net impact on Net Income attributable to LNR. 

         Madison FundsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company owned a 29.52% interest in Madison International Real Estate Fund II, LP, a 32.92%
interest in Madison International Real Estate Fund III, LP and a 29.52% interest in Madison GP1 Investors, LP (collectively, the "Madison Funds"). The Madison Funds invest
in ownership positions of entities that own real estate assets. The Company has determined that all of these entities are variable interest entities and that an external member is the primary
beneficiary. 
         Oak Hill FundsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company owned a 10.43% interest in Oak Hill Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. ("OHCOF"), a
5.92% interest in OHA Strategic Credit Master Fund, L.P. ("OHSCF"), and a 9.88% interest in Oak Hill Credit Partners II, Limited ("OHCP II") (collectively, the

"Oak
Hill Funds"). The Oak Hill Funds were formed to acquire and manage a diverse portfolio of assets, investing in distressed, stressed and undervalued loans, bonds, equities and other investments.
The Company appointed to its Board of Directors a member that holds an investment in the Oak Hill Funds. As such Oak Hill is a related party of the Company. 
         REHI InvestmentsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company owned 33% and 31% equity interests in two separate entities that received titles to
properties previously serving as collateral for loan investments of the Company. 
         Oak Hill AdvisorsIn October 2011, the Company sold a substantial portion of its interests in Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. and related entities for
$183.7 million of net cash proceeds, which resulted in a net gain of $30.3 million that was recorded in "Earnings from equity method investments" on the Company's Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The transaction was completed in part through sales of interests to unrelated third parties and in part through redemption of interests by the principals of Oak Hill
Advisors, L.P., including Glenn R. August. Mr. August serves as a member of the Company's Board of Directors and is also the president and senior partner of Oak Hill
Advisors, L.P. In conjunction with the sale of its interests in Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., the Company retained interests in its share of certain unearned incentive fees of various funds.
These fees are contingent on the future performance of the funds and the Company will recognize income related to these fees if and when the amounts are realized. 
         Other Equity Method InvestmentsThe Company also had smaller investments in several other entities that were accounted for under the equity method
where the Company has ownership interests up to 50.0%. Several of these investments are in real estate related funds or other strategic investment opportunities within niche markets. 
        During
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized impairment charges on certain of its equity method investments of $1.2 million and
$4.7 million, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a non-cash out-of-period charge of
$9.4 million to recognize additional losses from an equity method investment as a result of additional depreciation expense that should have been recorded at the equity method entity. This
adjustment was recorded as a reduction to "Other investments" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and a decrease to "Earnings from equity method investments," on the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The Company concluded that the amount of losses that should have been recorded in periods beginning in July 2007 were not material to any of its previously issued financial
statements. The Company also concluded that the cumulative out-of-period charge was not material to the fiscal year in which it has been recorded. As such, the charge was
recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, rather than restating prior periods.

(1)Includes
minimum required amortization payments on the Secured Credit Facility. 

         Secured Credit FacilityIn March 2011, the Company entered into a new $2.95 billion Secured Credit Facility comprised of a $1.50 billion
term loan facility bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and maturing in June 2013 (the "Tranche A-1 Facility") and a $1.45 billion term loan facility bearing
interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 5.75% maturing in June 2014 (the "Tranche A-2 Facility"), together the "Secured Credit Facility." Both tranches include a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. The
Tranche A-1 Facility and Tranche A-2 Facility were issued at discounts to par of 1.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Proceeds from the Secured Credit Facility were used
to fully repay the $1.67 billion and $0.9 billion outstanding under the Company's secured credit facilities, which were due to mature in June 2011 and June 2012, respectively, and to
repay $175.0 million of the Company's unsecured credit facilities due in June 2011. The remaining proceeds were used to repay other unsecured debt maturing in the first half of 2011. 
        The
Secured Credit Facility is collateralized by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets consisting of loan, net lease, OREO and REHI assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales
of collateral are applied to amortize the Secured Credit Facility. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments, fee income and, under certain circumstances, additional amounts funded on
assets serving as collateral are retained by the Company. The Tranche A-1 Facility requires that aggregate cumulative amortization payments of not less than $200.0 million
shall be made on or before December 30, 2011, not less than $450.0 million on or before June 30, 2012, not less than $750.0 million on or before December 31, 2012
and not less than $1.50 billion on or before June 28, 2013. The Tranche A-2 Facility will begin amortizing six months after the repayment in full of the
Tranche A-1 Facility, such that not less than $150.0 million of cumulative 
83



 
Table of Contents

iStar Financial Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Note 9Debt Obligations, net (Continued) 
amortization
payments shall be made on or before the six month anniversary of repayment of the A-1 Facility, with additional amortization payments of $150.0 million due on or before
each six month anniversary thereafter, with any unpaid principal amounts due at maturity in June 2014. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company used proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral to repay $538.4 million of its
Tranche A-1 Facility. These repayments exceeded the $450.0 million cumulative amortization required to be paid by June 30, 2012, leaving $211.6 million to be
paid on or before December 31, 2012. Repayments of the facility prior to scheduled amortization dates have resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $12.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011, related to the acceleration of discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company received $9.1 million pursuant to an agreement with a holder of the Company's previously outstanding secured credit
facilities. The amount effectively reduced the par value that was repaid to the debtholder and was accounted for under ASC 470-60, resulting in $3.7 million being recognized
during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a gain on extinguishment of debt. As the same lender participated in the new Secured Credit Facility, the remaining amount was recorded as a premium
to that facility and will serve to reduce a portion of future interest expense as it is amortized through its maturity. 
         Unsecured Credit FacilitiesIn June 2011, the Company repaid the $329.9 million remaining principal balance of its LIBOR + 0.85%
unsecured line of credit. 
         Secured Term LoansIn June 2011, the Company entered into a $120.0 million secured term loan financing maturing in July 2021. This financing is
collateralized by net lease properties occupied by a single tenant and bears interest at 5.05%. 
        In
March 2011, the Company refinanced the $47.7 million outstanding principal balance of a maturing secured term loan. In addition, during June 2011, the Company entered into an
additional $4.6 million secured term loan. The loans bear interest at LIBOR + 4.50%, mature in 2014 and are cross-collateralized by the same net lease assets. Simultaneously with the
financings, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to exchange its variable rates on the notes for fixed interest rates (see Note 10). 
        In
2010, the Company repaid other secured term loans, including a $947.9 million non-recourse loan that was collateralized by the portfolio of net lease assets sold
during the period, as well as $153.3 million of other term loans with various maturities. In connection with these repayments, the Company expensed unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred
other expenses totaling $22.1 million, which reduced net gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
         Secured NotesDuring 2009, the Company completed a series of private offers in which the Company issued $155.3 million and
$479.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.0% second priority senior secured guaranteed notes due 2011 and 10.0% second priority senior secured guaranteed notes due 2014, respectively,
in exchange for $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes of various series. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a $107.9 million gain on
early extinguishment of debt, net of closing costs of $11.8 million, during the year ended
December 31, 2009, and recorded a deferred gain of $262.7 million which was reflected as premiums to the par value of the new debt.

        During 2010, the Company redeemed or repurchased $322.5 million par value of its 2011 and 2014 Notes, generating $71.3 million of gains on early extinguishment of debt. 
        In
January 2011, the Company fully redeemed the $312.3 million remaining principal balance of its 10% 2014 Notes and recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of
$109.0 million primarily related to the recognition of the deferred gain premiums that resulted from the exchange. 
         Unsecured NotesDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company repaid, upon maturity, the $170.4 million outstanding principal
balance of its 5.65% senior unsecured notes, the $96.9 million outstanding principal balance of its 5.125% senior unsecured notes and the $107.8 million outstanding principal balance of
its 5.80% senior unsecured notes. In addition, the Company repurchased $97.2 million par value of its senior unsecured with various maturities ranging from September 2011 to October 2012. In
connection with these repurchases, the Company recorded an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased $592.8 million par value of senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from March 2010 to March
2014 generating $59.7 million in net gains on early extinguishment of debt. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased $1.31 billion par value of senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from January 2009 to
March 2017 generating $439.4 million in net gains on early extinguishment of debt. 
         Unencumbered/Encumbered AssetsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company had unencumbered assets, including cash, with a gross carrying value of
$4.68 billion, gross of $707.3 million of accumulated depreciation and loan loss reserves, and encumbered assets with a carrying value of $3.53 billion. The carrying value of our

 Debt Covenants  
        The Company's outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of
unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a restriction on debt incurrence based upon the effect of the debt incurrence on the Company's fixed charge coverage. If any of the
Company's covenants is breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of its debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the
requisite percentage of the bondholders. While
the Company expects that its ability to incur new indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio will be limited for the foreseeable future, it will

 Note 9Debt Obligations, net (Continued) 
continue
to be permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures. 
        The
Company's Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes,
transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the Company is required to maintain collateral
coverage of 1.25x outstanding borrowings. In addition, for so long as the Company maintains its qualification as a REIT, the Secured Credit Facility permits it to distribute 100% of its REIT taxable
income on an annual basis. The Company may not pay common dividends if it ceases to qualify as a REIT. 
        The
Company's Secured Credit Facility contains cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate the Company's indebtedness to them if
the Company fails to pay amounts due in respect of its other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to
accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing the Company's unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate the Company's
indebtedness to them if the Company's other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated. 
 Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  
         Business Risks and UncertaintiesThe Company's business has been and continues to be adversely affected by the recent economic recession and
illiquidity and volatility in the credit and commercial real estate markets. The Company experienced significant provisions for loan losses and impairments resulting from high levels of
non-performing loans and increasing amounts of real estate owned as the Company took title to assets of defaulting borrowers. The economic conditions and their effect on the Company's
operations also resulted in increased financing costs and an inability to access the unsecured debt markets. Since the beginning of the crisis, the Company has significantly curtailed asset
originations and has focused primarily on resolving problem assets, generating liquidity, retiring debt, and decreasing leverage with the objective of preserving shareholder value. 
        The
Company saw signs of an economic recovery during 2010 and 2011, including some improvements in the commercial real estate market and capital markets. These conditions resulted in
reduced additions to non-performing loans, reductions in provisions for loan losses and increased levels of liquidity to fund operations. These improving conditions allowed the Company to
complete the Secured Credit Facility in March of 2011. While the Company has benefited from improving conditions, volatility within the capital markets and commercial real estate market continues to
have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, as primarily evidenced by continuing elevated levels of non-performing assets and higher costs of capital. Further, improvement in the Company's
financial condition and operating results and its ability to generate sufficient liquidity are dependent on a sustained economic recovery, which cannot be predicted with certainty. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.60 billion of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before December 31, 2012. Of this
amount, $211.6 million represents the minimum amortization payable by December 31, 2012 under the Secured Credit Facility, which is collateralized by assets with a carrying value of
$3.08 billion. The Company expects to use proceeds
from repayments and sales of the pledged collateral to meet these amortization payments. The remaining

        As of December 31, 2011, the Company had unrestricted cash of $356.8 million and other unencumbered assets with a carrying value of
$3.69 billion. The Company's capital sources to meet its unsecured debt maturities in the coming year will primarily include debt refinancings, proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments
from borrowers, and may include equity capital raising transactions. The Company has identified unencumbered assets with a carrying value of approximately $1.5 billion that it will use either
as collateral for secured refinancings or will sell strategically during the year ending December 31, 2012. The Company currently expects that the majority of such asset sales would occur
during the second half of 2012. Based upon the dynamic nature of the Company's assets and its liquidity plan and the time frame in which the Company needs to generate liquidity, the specific assets,
nature of the transactions, timing and amount of asset sales and refinancing transactions could vary. The Company may also encounter difficulty in finding buyers of assets or executing capital raising
strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could impact its ability to make scheduled repayments on its outstanding debt. However, given the Company's unencumbered asset base and current
market conditions, the Company believes that it has several options that can be reasonably and timely executed to enable the Company to repay its debt obligations during 2012 as they come due. 
        The
timing and amounts of proceeds from expected asset repayments and sales, and the Company's ability to consummate debt refinancing and equity capital raising transactions are subject
to factors outside its control and cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company's plans are dynamic and it may adjust its plans in response to changes in its expectations and changes in market
conditions. In addition, although there were early signs of improvement in the commercial real estate and credit markets beginning in 2010 and in 2011, such markets remain volatile and it is not
possible for the Company to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or other trends on its financial results. If the Company fails to repay its
obligations as they become due, it would be an event of default under the relevant debt instruments, which could result in a cross-default and acceleration of the Company's other outstanding debt
obligations, all of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
         Unfunded CommitmentsThe Company has certain off-balance sheet unfunded commitments. The Company generally funds construction and
development loans and build-outs of space in net lease assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. The
Company refers to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, the Company will sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional fundings which it will make available to a
borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if it approves of the expansion or addition at its sole discretion. The Company refers to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings.
Finally, the Company has committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2011, the
maximum amounts of the fundings the Company may make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that it will

        For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a $42.4 million lease termination expense in "Other expense" on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations pursuant to a settlement agreement under which the Company terminated a long-term lease for new headquarters space and settled all disputes with the landlord. 
        The
Company also has issued letters of credit totaling $12.7 million in connection with six of its investments. 
        Legal ProceedingsThe Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary
routine litigation incidental to the Company's business as a finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry, including loan foreclosure and foreclosure-related
proceedings. The Company discloses certain of its more significant legal proceedings under "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011 (Legal Proceedings). 
        A liability
is accrued when it is both (a) probable that a loss with respect to the legal proceeding has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could require a liability to be accrued. Based on its current knowledge, and after consultation with
legal counsel, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor is any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial condition. 
 Note 11Equity  

        The Company's charter provides for the issuance of up to 200.0 million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share and 30.0 million shares of preferred stock. As of

(1)Holders
of shares of the Series D, E, F, G and I preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors,
out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Dividends are cumulative from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly in arrears on or before the 15th day of each
March, June, September and December or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day. Any dividend payable on the preferred stock for any partial dividend period will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as of the close of business on the first day of the calendar month in
which the applicable dividend payment date falls or on another date designated by the Board of Directors of the Company for the payment of dividends that is not more than 30 nor less than ten days
prior to the dividend payment date.
(2)The
Company declared and paid dividends aggregating $8.0 million, $11.0 million, $7.8 million, $6.1 million and $9.4 million on
its Series D, E, F, G, and I preferred stock, respectively, during each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There are no dividend arrearages on any of the preferred shares
currently outstanding. 

        The Series D, E, F, G, and I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock are redeemable without premium at the option of the Company at their
respective liquidation preferences beginning on October 8, 2002, July 18, 2008, September 29, 2008, December 19, 2008 and March 1, 2009, respectively. 
 High Performance Unit Program  
        In May 2002, the Company's shareholders approved the iStar Financial High Performance Unit ("HPU") Program. The program entitled
employee participants ("HPU Holders") to receive distributions if the total rate of return on the Company's Common Stock (share price appreciation plus dividends) exceeded certain performance
thresholds over a specified valuation period. The Company established seven HPU plans that had valuation periods ending between 2002 and 2008 and the Company has not established any new HPU plans
since 2005. HPU Holders purchased their interests in High Performance Common Stock for aggregate initial purchase prices of approximately $2.8 million, $1.8 million, $1.4 million,
$0.6 million, $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.8 million for the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 plans, respectively. 
        The
2002, 2003 and 2004 plans all exceeded their performance thresholds and are entitled to receive distributions equivalent to the amount of dividends payable on 819,254 shares, 987,149
shares and 1,031,875 shares, respectively, of the Company's Common Stock as and when such dividends are paid on

 Note 11Equity (Continued) 
the
Company's Common Stock. Each of these three plans has 5,000 shares of High Performance Common Stock associated with it, which is recorded as a separate class of stock within shareholders' equity
on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. High Performance Common Stock carries 0.25 votes per share. Net income allocable to common shareholders is reduced by the HPU holders' share of earnings. 
        The
remaining four plans that had valuation periods which ended in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, did not meet their required performance thresholds and none of the plans were funded. As a
result, the Company redeemed the participants' units for approximately $1,700 resulting in the unit holders losing $2.4 million of aggregate contributions. 
        In
addition to these plans, a high performance unit program for executive officers was established with plans having three-year valuation periods which ended
December 31, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The provisions of these plans were substantially the same as the high performance unit programs for employees. The Chief Executive Officer and former
President collectively purchased 100% interests in the Company's 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 high performance unit program for senior executive officers for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.5 million. These plans did not meet the required
performance thresholds and were not funded, resulting in the Chief Executive Officer and former President losing $0.9 million and $0.6 million in total contributions, respectively. 
         DividendsIn order to maintain its election to qualify as a REIT, the Company must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90% of its
taxable income, excluding net capital gains, and must distribute 100% of its taxable income (including net capital gains) to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes. The Company has recorded net
operating losses and may record net operating losses in the future, which may reduce its taxable income in future periods and lower or eliminate entirely the Company's obligation to pay dividends for
such periods in order to maintain its REIT qualification. Because taxable income differs from cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues and expenses (such as depreciation and
certain asset impairments), in certain circumstances, the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its dividends or, alternatively, may be required to borrow to make sufficient dividend
payments. The Company's Secured Credit Facility permits the Company to distribute 100% of its REIT taxable income on an annual basis, for so long as the Company maintains its qualification as a REIT.
The Secured Credit Facility restricts the Company from paying any common dividends if it ceases to qualify as a REIT. The Company did not declare or pay any Common Stock dividends for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
         Stock Repurchase ProgramOn August 8, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase
of up to $65.0 million of its Common Stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. When aggregated with the
$14.1 million remaining authorization from previous repurchase programs, the Company had $79.1 million of its Common Stock available for repurchases during the year ended
December 31, 2011. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased 12.3 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock for approximately $78.5 million, at an average
cost of $6.43 per share, and repurchases were recorded at cost. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $0.6 million of Common Stock available to repurchase under its Board authorized
stock repurchase programs.

 Note 12Risk Management and Derivatives  
 Risk management  
        In the normal course of its on-going business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are three main
components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at
different points in time and potentially at different bases, than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company's lending investments or leases that result from a
borrower's or tenant's inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of loans and other lending investments due to changes in interest
rates or other market factors, including the rate of prepayments of principal and the value of the collateral underlying loans, the valuation of net lease, REHI and OREO assets by the Company as well
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
         Risk concentrationsAs of December 31, 2011, the Company's total investment portfolio was comprised of the following property/collateral types

Explanatory Note:





(1)Based
on the carrying value of our total investment portfolio gross of general loan loss reserves. 

        Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or customers related to the Company's investments are engaged in similar business
activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be
similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risks. Management believes the current
portfolio is reasonably well diversified and does not contain any significant concentration of credit risks. 
        Substantially
all of the Company's net lease, REHI and OREO assets as well as assets collateralizing its loans and other lending investments are located in the United States, with
California 15.3% and Florida 11.0% representing the only significant concentrations (greater than 10.0%) as of December 31, 2011. The Company's portfolio contains significant concentrations in
the following asset types as of December 31, 2011: land 19.7%, apartment/residential 18.4%, retail 11.4% and office 10.2%. 
        The
Company underwrites the credit of prospective borrowers and customers and often requires them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit
and/or cash security deposits. Although the Company's loans and other lending investments and net lease assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and customers operate in a variety of
industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or customer, the inability of that borrower or customer to make
its payment could have an adverse effect on the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the Company's five largest borrowers or
tenants collectively accounted for approximately 22.4% of the Company's aggregate annualized interest and operating lease revenue, of which no single customer accounts for more than 8.0%.

 Derivatives  
        The Company's use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate hedges and foreign
exchange hedges. The principal objective of such hedges are to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure and to manage its exposure to foreign
exchange rate movements. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements, foreign exchange rate movements, and other
identified risks, but may not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements.

        The effective portion of the change in the fair value of these qualifying hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"
on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects that $0.5 million of expense and $0.7 million of income related to the qualifying cash
flow hedges and previously terminated cash flow hedges, respectively, will be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. 
        Credit risk-related contingent featuresThe Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision
where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
        In
connection with its foreign currency derivatives, as of December 31, 2011, the Company has posted collateral of $9.6 million, which is included in "Restricted cash" on
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Note 13Stock-Based Compensation Plans and Employee Benefits  

        On May 27, 2009, the Company's shareholders approved the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2009 LTIP") which is designed to provide incentive compensation
for officers, key employees, directors and advisors of the Company. The 2009 LTIP provides for awards of stock options, shares of restricted stock, phantom shares, restricted stock units, dividend
equivalent rights and other share-based performance awards. A maximum of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be awarded under the 2009 LTIP, plus up to an additional 500,000 shares to the extent that
a corresponding number of equity awards previously granted under the Company's 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan expire or are cancelled or forfeited. All awards under the 2009 LTIP are made
at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors.

 Note 13Stock-Based Compensation Plans and Employee Benefits (Continued)  

        The Company's 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2006 LTIP") is designed to provide equity-based incentive compensation for officers, key employees, directors, consultants
and advisers of the Company. The 2006 LTIP provides for awards of stock options, shares of restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other share-based performance awards. A
maximum of 4,550,000 shares of Common Stock may be subject to awards under the 2006 LTIP provided that the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for grants of options designated as incentive stock
options is 1.0 million, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions in the
2006 LTIP. All awards under this Plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors. 
        The
Company's 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan ("Incentive Plan") was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors in 2007 in order to establish performance goals for selected officers
and other key employees and to determine bonuses that will be awarded to those officers and other key employees based on the extent to which they achieve those performance goals. Equity-based awards
may be made under the Incentive Plan, subject to the terms of the Company's equity incentive plans. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 3.7 million shares remain available for awards under the Company's 2006 and 2009 LTIP. 
         Stock-based CompensationThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $29.7 million, $19.4 million and $23.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively in "General and administrative" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2011, there was $23.8 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested restricted stock units and the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting/service period of
0.95 years.

have cliff vested in one installment on October 9, 2011 only if the total shareholder return on the Company's Common Stock was at least 25% per year (compounded at the end of the three year
vesting period, including dividends). Total shareholder return was based on the average NYSE closing prices for the Company's Common Stock for the 20 days prior to: (a) the date of the
award on October 9, 2008; and (b) the vesting date. The total shareholder return during the three year period was approximately 83%, which was less than the 95% threshold return
established in the award agreement. 
On October 7, 2011, the Company granted 2,000,000 service-based restricted stock units to the Company's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer with vesting installments of 40% on October 15, 2011 and 30% each on June 15 of 2013 and 2014. On October 15, 2011, the first installment, of 800,000
units vested and were issued to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. These awards carry dividend equivalent rights that entitle the
holder to receive dividend payments prior to vesting, if and when dividends are paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock. 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company granted 721,257 service based restricted stock units to
employees with original vesting terms ranging from two to three years. Unit holders will receive shares of the Company's Common Stock in the amount of the units granted, net of statutory minimum
required tax withholdings, if and when the units vest. As of December 31, 2011, 718,957 of the awards remain outstanding. These awards carry dividend equivalent rights that entitle the holder
to receive dividend payments prior to vesting, if and when dividends are paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock.

In July 2011, the Company modified the terms of its then outstanding 8,305,000 market-condition based restricted stock
units originally granted to executives and other officers of the Company on December 19, 2008 (the "Original Units"). Under the original terms of these awards, these units would have vested in
one installment on January 1, 2012 if the Common Stock had achieved a price of $10.00 or more (average NYSE closing price over 20 consecutive trading days) prior to December 19, 2011 and
the employee was thereafter employed on the vesting date. Under the terms of the modification, these restricted stock units provide that if the remaining share price target of $10.00 had not been met
before December 19, 2011, a portion of the Original Units (the "Amended Units") become eligible for future vesting if extended service period requirements are met. The number of Amended Units
is equal to 75% of the Original Units granted to an employee less, in the case of each executive level employee, the number of restricted stock units
granted to the executive in March 2011. The Amended Units will vest ratably on each of January 1, 2012, 2013 and 2014, so long as the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting
dates. Upon vesting of these Units, holders will receive shares of the Company's Common Stock in the amount of the vested Units, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. The $10.00 price of
the Original Units was not met prior to December 19, 2011. While the share price traded above the $10.00 target prior to December 19, 2011, it did not meet the 20 consecutive trading day
requirement. Therefore the adjusted amount of shares outstanding under this plan as of December 31, 2011 was 5,857,638. The modification of these awards resulted in additional
non-cash expense of approximately $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the remaining expense will be recognized over the extended service period through
January 1, 2014. The incremental expense was measured based on the fair value of the modified awards in excess of the fair value of the original award measured immediately before the terms were
modified, based on current assumptions. The estimated expense is based upon a number of assumptions and the actual expense could vary from the estimate if the actual experience regarding, among other
things, forfeiture and vesting is different from the assumptions. 
1,525,000 restricted stock units awarded to certain officers on October 9, 2008, as special retention incentive,
fully vested in one installment on October 9, 2011. These units were issued to certain officers, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. 

        Other Outstanding AwardsIn addition to the awards noted above, the following awards remained outstanding as of December 31,
2011:


1,340,620 service-based restricted stock units granted to employees that represent the right to receive an equivalent
number of shares of the Company's Common Stock. Unit holders will receive shares of the Company's Common Stock in the amount of the units granted, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings,
if and when the units vest. These units will cliff vest on February 17, 2012 if the employee is employed by the Company on that date and carry dividend equivalent rights that entitle the holder
to receive dividend payments prior to vesting, if and when dividends are paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock. 
806,518 performance-based restricted stock units granted to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer that
represent the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock. The unit holder will receive shares of the Company's Common Stock in the amount of the units granted, net
of statutory minimum required tax withholdings, if and when the units vest. The performance-based units will cliff vest on March 2, 2012 if certain performance

and
service conditions have been achieved, relating to reductions in the Company's general and administrative expenses, retirement of debt and continued employment. The performance conditions were
satisfied during the year ended December 31, 2010, therefore, vesting is now based solely on continued employment through March 2, 2012. Since the performance conditions have been
achieved, these units now carry dividend equivalent rights that entitle the holder to receive dividend payments, if and when dividends are paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock. 


61,330 service-based restricted stock units granted to employees with original vesting terms ranging from three to five
years that are entitled to receive dividend payments if and when dividends are paid on shares of the Company's Common Stock. 

         Market-condition award assumptionsThe fair values of the market-condition based restricted stock units, were determined by utilizing a Monte
Carlo
model to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company's Common Stock. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of market-condition based awards:

(1)The
modified December 19, 2008 market-condition based restricted stock units were measured on July 1, 2011, the date the Company's Board of
Directors' approved the modification of the award.
(2)Contingent
equity-based restricted stock units awarded on October 9, 2008 were measured on May 27, 2009, the date the Company's shareholders
approved the grant of the award.
(3)The
units granted on December 19, 2008 were re-measured on May 27, 2009 when they became equity-based awards in accordance with
ASC 718-20-55-135 to 138. 

         Common Stock EquivalentsNon-employee directors are awarded common stock equivalents ("CSEs") at the time of the annual shareholders'
meeting in consideration for their services on the Company's Board of Directors. The CSEs generally vest at the time of the next annual shareholders meeting and pay dividends in an amount equal to the
dividends paid on an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock from the date of grant, as and when dividends are paid on the Common Stock. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company awarded to Directors 61,160 CSEs with a service vesting period ending in May 2012. These CSEs pay dividends in an amount equal
to the dividends paid on the equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock from the date of grant, as and when dividends are paid on the Common Stock. The aggregate grant date fair value
of these awards was $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2011, 343,118 CSEs granted to members of the Company's Board of Directors remained outstanding and had an aggregate intrinsic value of $1.8
million. 
        During
2011, the Company's Board of Directors decided pursuant to the terms of the non-employee directors deferral plan to require settlement of CSEs in shares of the Company's Common
Stock, thereby

eliminating
the cash settlement option. This modification converted these liability-based awards to equity awards and as such, the Company reclassified $2.4 million from "Accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other liabilities" to "Additional paid-in capital" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet during the year ended December 31, 2011. 
 401(k) Plan  
        The Company has a savings and retirement plan (the "401(k) Plan"), which is a voluntary, defined contribution plan. All employees are
eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan following completion of three months of continuous service with the Company. Each participant may contribute on a pretax basis up to the maximum percentage
of compensation and dollar amount permissible under Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code not to exceed the limits of Code Sections 401(k), 404 and 415. At the discretion of the
Board of Directors, the Company may make matching contributions on the participant's behalf of up to 50% of the first 10% of the participant's annual compensation. The Company made gross contributions
of approximately $0.9 million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
 Note 14Earnings Per Share  

        EPS is calculated using the two-class method, which allocates earnings among common stock and participating securities to calculate EPS when an entity's capital structure
includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities. HPU holders are current and former Company employees who purchased high performance common stock units
under the Company's High Performance Unit (HPU) Program (see Note 11). These HPU units have been treated as a separate class of common stock.

 Note 16Fair Values  

        Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The
following fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to be used in valuation techniques to measure fair value: 

        Level 1:  Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
        Level 2:  Quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability; 
        Level 3:  Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little
or no market activity). 

        Certain
of the Company's assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Assets required to be
marked-to-market and reported at fair value every reporting period are classified as being valued on a recurring basis. Other assets not required to be recorded at fair value
every period may be recorded at fair value if a specific provision or other impairment is recorded within the period to mark the carrying value of the asset to market as of the reporting date. Such
assets are classified as being valued on a non-recurring basis. 
        The
following table summarizes the Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis by the above categories ($ in thousands):

(1)The
carrying values of other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accrued interest receivable and accounts payable,
approximate the fair values of the instruments. The fair value of other financial instruments, including derivative assets and liabilities and marketable securities are included in the previous table. 

        Given the nature of certain assets and liabilities, clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available, therefore, these
assets and liabilities are valued using internal valuation techniques. Subjectivity exists with respect to these internal valuation techniques, therefore, the fair values disclosed may not ultimately
be realized by the Company if the assets were sold or the liabilities were settled with third parties. The methods the Company used to estimate the fair values presented in the two tables above are
described more fully below for each type of asset and liability. 
         DerivativesThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives to manage its interest rate and foreign currency risk. The valuation
of these instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the
period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to
appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty's non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of
its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings,
thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. The Company has determined that the significant inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
         SecuritiesThe Company's available-for-sale and impaired held-to-maturity debt and equity securities
are actively traded and have been valued using quoted market prices. 
        Impaired loansThe Company's loans identified as being impaired are nearly all collateral dependent loans and are evaluated for impairment by
comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the carrying value of each loan. Due to the nature of the individual properties collateralizing the Company's
loans, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral. This approach

iStar Financial Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Note 16Fair Values (Continued) 
requires
the Company to make significant judgments in respect to discount rates, capitalization rates and the timing and amounts of estimated future cash flows that are all considered Level 3
inputs. These cash flows generally include property revenues, lot and unit sale prices and velocity, operating costs, and costs of completion. In more limited cases, the Company obtains external "as
is" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist, and appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate. 
         Impaired equity method investmentsIf the Company determines an equity method investment is other than temporarily impaired it records an impairment
charge to adjust the investment to its estimated fair market value. To estimate the fair value of an investment in a fund that invests in real estate, the Company estimates the fair value of the
individual properties held within the fund using a discounted cash flow methodology through internally developed valuation models. This approach requires the Company to make significant judgments with
respect to discount rates, capitalization rates and the timing and amounts of estimated future cash flows that are all considered Level 3 inputs. These cash flows are primarily based on
expected future leasing rates, operating costs and sales prices. 
         Impaired OREO assetsIf the Company determines an OREO asset is impaired it records an impairment charge to adjust the asset to its estimated fair
market value less costs to sell. Due to the nature of the individual properties in the OREO portfolio, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology through internally developed
valuation models to estimate the fair value of the assets. This approach requires the Company to make significant judgments with respect to discount rates, capitalization rates and the timing and
amounts of estimated future cash flows that are all considered Level 3 inputs. These cash flows generally include property revenues, lot and unit sale prices and velocity, operating costs, and
costs of completion. 
         Loans and other lending investmentsThe Company estimates the fair value of its performing loans and other lending investments using a discounted cash
flow methodology. This method discounts estimated future cash flows using rates management determines best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar
characteristics and credit quality. 
        Debt obligations, netFor debt obligations traded in secondary markets, the Company uses market quotes, to the extent they are available, to determine
fair value. For debt obligations not traded in secondary markets, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow
methodology, whereby contractual cash flows are discounted at rates that management determines best reflect current market interest rates that would be charged for debt with similar characteristics
and credit quality. 
 Note 17Segment Reporting  

        The Company has determined that it has three reportable segments based on how management reviews and manages its business. These reportable segments include: Real Estate Lending, Net
Leasing and Real Estate Investment. The Real Estate Lending segment includes all of the Company's activities related to senior and mezzanine real estate debt and corporate capital investments. The Net
Leasing segment includes all of the Company's activities related to the ownership and leasing of corporate facilities. The Real Estate Investment segment includes all of the Company's activities
related to the operations, repositioning and redevelopment of REHI and OREO properties.

Company
recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $109.0 million for the redemption of its $312.3 million remaining principal amount of 10% senior secured notes due June 2014. 


(2)During
the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the Company recorded gains from discontinued operations of $250.3 million for the sale of a portfolio
of 32 net lease assets (see Note 6). 

 Note 19Subsequent Events  

        On February 28, 2012, the Company announced the launch of a syndication of up to $900.0 million in new senior secured credit facilities. The Company expects the facilities
to be comprised of two tranches, maturing in 2016 and 2017, with differing interest rates. Outstanding borrowings under the facilities will be collateralized by a pool of diversified collateral,
including loans, net lease assets and other real estate assets. The proceeds from the new credit facilities will be used to refinance the Company's 2012 unsecured debt maturities. The Company is in
the process of syndicating the new facilities and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in its efforts to complete the syndication.
