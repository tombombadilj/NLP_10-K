Table of Contents
PART I  Item1. Business  GENERAL 
Our principal business is the design, manufacture, and installation of laboratory, healthcare, and technical furniture products.
Laboratory furniture products include both steel and wood cabinetry, fume hoods, adaptable modular systems, moveable workstations, environmentally friendly casework, biological safety cabinets and epoxy resin counters and sinks. Healthcare furniture
products include laminate casework, systems and related products for healthcare applications. Technical furniture products include column systems, slotted-post systems, pedestal systems and stand-alone benches. 
Our products are sold primarily through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents
and a national distributor, as well as through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries in India and Singapore. Products are sold principally to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, industrial, chemical, and commercial research laboratories,
educational institutions, healthcare institutions, governmental entities, manufacturing facilities, and users of networking furniture. We consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive, with a significant amount of the business
involving competitive public bidding.  It is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customer orders
to require delivery at extended future dates, as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed. Changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale. Since
prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between quotation of an order and delivery of the product. The impact of such possible increases is considered when
determining the sales price.  Our need for working capital and our credit practices are comparable to those of other
companies manufacturing, selling, and installing similar products in similar markets. Since our products are used in building construction projects, in many cases payments for our products are received over longer periods of time than payments for
many other types of manufactured products, thus requiring increased working capital. In addition, payment terms associated with certain projects provide for a retention amount until completion of the project, thus also increasing required working
capital. On average, payments for our products are received during the quarter following shipment, with the exception of the retention amounts which are collected at the completion of the project. 
The principal raw materials and products manufactured by others and used by us in our products are cold-rolled carbon and stainless
steel, hardwood lumber and plywood, paint, chemicals, resins, hardware, plumbing, and electrical fittings. Such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available. 
We hold various patents and patent rights, but do not consider that our success or growth is dependent upon our patents or patent
rights. Our business is not dependent upon licenses, franchises, concessions, trademarks, royalty agreements, or labor contracts.  Our business is not generally cyclical, although sales are sometimes lower during our third quarter because of slower construction activity in certain areas of the country during the winter months. Our
business is not dependent on any one or a few customers; however, sales to our national distributor, VWR International, LLC, represented approximately 12%, 14%, and 10% of sales in each of fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 
Our order backlog at April 30, 2012 was $86.2 million, as compared to $65.7 million at April 30, 2011 and $68.9 million at
April 30, 2010. All but $24.2 million of the backlog at April 30, 2012 was scheduled for shipment during fiscal year 2013; however, it may reasonably be expected that delays in shipments will occur because of customer rescheduling or delay
in completion of projects which involve the installation of our products. Based on scheduled shipment dates and past experience, we estimate that more than 65 percent of our order backlog at April 30, 2012 will be shipped during fiscal
year 2013.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our Domestic and International business segments.

Table of Contents
COMPETITION  We consider the industries in which we compete to be highly competitive and believe that the principal competitive factors are price, product performance, and customer service. A significant portion of
our business is based upon competitive public bidding.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The amount spent and expensed by us during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012 on research and development activities related to
new or redesigned products was $941,000. The amounts spent for similar purposes in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010 were $1,181,000 and $1,296,000, respectively.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  In the last three fiscal years, compliance with
federal, state, or local provisions enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has had no material effect on us. There is no material capital expenditure anticipated for such purposes, and accordingly, such
regulation is not expected to have a material effect on our earnings or competitive position.  EMPLOYEES 
At April 30, 2012, we had 440 domestic and 118 international full-time employees. 
OTHER INFORMATION  Our
Internet address is www.kewaunee.com. We make available, free of charge through this web site, our annual report to stockholders. Our Form 10-K and 10-Q financial reports may be obtained by stockholders by writing the Secretary of the

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  Certain statements included and referenced in this report, including
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act).
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could significantly impact results or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not
limited to, economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services, and prices, as well as prices for certain raw materials and energy. The cautionary statements made by us pursuant to
the Reform Act herein and elsewhere should not be construed as exhaustive. We cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. In addition, readers are urged
to consider statements that include the terms believes, belief, expects, plans, objectives, anticipates, intends or the like to be uncertain and forward-looking.

Table of Contents
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
You should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks
actually occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock would decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock. 
This and other public reports may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and
projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, as more fully described below and
elsewhere in our public reports. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reasons, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. 
Disruptions in the financial markets have created uncertainty and deteriorating economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and our
business.  The financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia continue to be volatile. The tightening of credit
in financial markets, continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions, a prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and on our
sales, pricing and profitability. We are unable to predict the likely duration of these adverse economic conditions and the impact these events may have on our operations and the laboratory furniture industry in general. 
If we fail to compete effectively, our revenue and profit margins could decline. 
We face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate. Competitive pricing, including price competition or the
introduction of new products, could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins.  Our ability to compete
effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects, engineers, and customers. If a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design, materials, manufacturing, testing, or
quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors, our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected.  If we lose a large customer, our sales and profits would decline.  We
have substantial sales to one large customer. That distributor accounted for approximately 12% of our net sales in fiscal year 2012. Loss of all or a part of our sales to a large customer would have a material effect on our revenues and profits.
 An increase in the price of raw materials and energy could negatively affect our sales and profits. 
It is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customers to require delivery at extended future dates, as
products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed. Since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor, material, and energy costs between the quotation of an
order and the delivery of the products. Our principal raw materials are steel, including stainless steel, wood, and epoxy resin. Numerous factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, competition, worldwide demand, labor costs,
energy costs, and import duties and other trade restrictions, influence prices for our raw materials. We have not always been able, and in the future we might not be able, to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in
costs of raw materials, without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits. Where we are not able to increase our prices, increases in our raw material costs will adversely affect our profitability. 
Our future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new international markets. 
International laws and regulations, construction customs, standards, techniques, and methods differ from those in the United States.
Significant challenges of conducting business in foreign countries include, among other factors, local acceptance of our products, political instability, currency controls, changes in import and export regulations, changes in tariff and freight
rates, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Events outside our control may affect our operating results. 
We have little control over the timing of shipping customer orders, as customers required delivery dates are subject to change by
the customer. Construction delays and customer changes to product designs are among the factors that may delay the 
  5 


Table of Contents

start of manufacturing and shipments of orders. Shipments that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters results. Weather conditions, such as
unseasonably warm, cold, or wet weather, can also affect and sometimes delay projects. Political and economic events can also affect our revenues. When sales do not meet our expectations, our operating results will be reduced for the relevant
quarters.  Our principal markets are in the laboratory building construction industry. This industry is subject to
significant volatility due to various factors, none of which is within our control. Declines in construction activity or demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
We depend on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business. 
We depend on certain key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees may materially and adversely affect
us. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, marketing, and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities. We might not be able to attract or retain
such personnel.  Our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop. 
The trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variation in operating
results, announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries, relatively low trading volume in our common stock, and other events or
factors. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating
performance of those companies. Securities market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  We are subject
to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecasts, targets, or projections, including:   



 
 Failing to anticipate the need for, appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human, information technology, and logistical resources
necessary to support our business, including managing the costs associated with such resources;   



 
 Failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and, if necessary, secure adequate external financing to fund our growth; and
  



 
 Interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels. 
Item 2. Properties  We own and operate three adjacent manufacturing facilities in Statesville, North Carolina. These facilities also house our corporate offices, as well as sales and marketing, administration, engineering
and drafting personnel. These facilities together comprise approximately 413,000 square feet and are located on approximately 20 acres of land. In addition, at April 30, 2012, we leased our primary distribution facility and other warehouse
facilities totaling 220,000 square feet in Statesville, North Carolina. In Bangalore, India we also lease and operate a manufacturing facility comprising 55,000 square feet, a warehouse facility comprising 11,000 square feet, and a facility
comprising 7,000 square feet that houses sales and administrative offices. The Companys real property and equipment located in Statesville, North Carolina are pledged as collateral for the Companys term loan that is scheduled to mature
on August 
1, 2017. We believe our facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our current needs.  Item 3.
 Legal Proceedings  From time to time, we are involved in disputes and litigation relating to claims arising out of
our operations in the ordinary course of business. Further, we are periodically subject to government audits and inspections. We believe that any such matters presently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
 Not Applicable.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Certain statements in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 (the Reform Act). Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could significantly impact results or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
These factors include, but are not limited to, economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services, and prices. The cautionary statements made pursuant to the Reform Act herein and
elsewhere by us should not be construed as exhaustive. We cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. In addition, readers are urged to consider
statements that include the terms believes, belief, expects, plans, objectives, anticipates, intends, or the like to be uncertain and forward-looking. Over time, our
actual results, performance, or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such difference might be significant and harmful to our
stockholders interest. Many important factors that could cause such a difference are described under the caption Risk Factors, in Item 1A of this Annual Report, which you should review carefully. 
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  INTRODUCTION  Kewaunee Scientific Corporation is a recognized leader in the design,
manufacture, and installation of laboratory, healthcare, and technical furniture. The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Statesville, North Carolina. The Companys manufacturing facilities are located in Statesville and
Bangalore, India. The Company has subsidiaries in Singapore and Bangalore that serve the Asian and Middle East markets. Kewaunee Scientifics website is located at www.kewaunee.com. 
Our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents, a national
distributor, and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries. Products are sold principally to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, industrial, chemical, and commercial research laboratories, educational institutions, healthcare
institutions, governmental entities, manufacturing facilities, and users of networking furniture. We consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive, with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding.
 It is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates, as
products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed. Changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale. Since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in
the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between quotation of an order and delivery of the product. The impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price. The principal raw
materials and products manufactured by others used in our products are cold-rolled carbon and stainless steel, hardwood lumbers and plywood, paint, chemicals, resins, hardware, plumbing and electrical fittings. Such materials and products are
purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial
position in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the
following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective, and
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Revenue
Recognition  A portion of our product sales result from fixed-price construction contracts. In these instances, we are usually in the role
of a subcontractor, but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end-user of the products. Our contract arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered items. Product sales resulting from
fixed-price 
  9 


Table of Contents

construction contracts are generated from multiple-element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements. The Company has
determined that its multiple-element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are (1) product sales and (2) installation services. There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the product sales and
installation services, and allocation of arrangement consideration for each of these units is based on their relative fair values. Each of these elements represents individual units of accounting, as the delivered item has value to a customer on a
stand-alone basis. The Companys products are regularly sold on a stand-alone basis to customers which provides vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value. The fair value of installation services is separately calculated using expected
costs of installation services. Many times the value of installation services is calculated using price quotations from subcontractors to the Company, who perform installation services on a stand-alone basis. Assuming all other criteria for revenue
recognition have been met, we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment. Product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor. This category includes
product sales for standard products, as well as products which require some customization. These sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board (FOB) shipping point and do not include
rights of return. Accordingly, these sales are recognized at the time of shipment.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
Evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts
receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where management is aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be
collected, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, a
general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding.  Inventories  The majority of inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The LIFO method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold, and, therefore, recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials and other inventory costs more quickly than
other methods. Inventories at our international subsidiaries are measured on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  Pension
Benefits  We sponsor pension plans covering all employees who met eligibility requirements as of April 30, 2005. In February 2005, our
pension plans were amended as of April 30, 2005. No further benefits have been, or will be, earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date, and no additional participants have been, or will be, added to the plans. Several statistical
and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit
obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines. The actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or
shorter life spans of participants. These differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Sales for fiscal year 2012 were $102.8 million, an increase of 3%
from fiscal year 2011 sales of $100.0 million. Domestic Operations sales for fiscal year 2012 were $84.0 million, comparable to fiscal year 2011 sales of $84.1 million. International Operations sales for fiscal year 2012 were $18.9 million, an
increase of nearly 19% from fiscal year 2011 sales of $15.9 million. The increase in International Operations sales reflected increased sales opportunities as the international marketplace continued its recovery. Sales for fiscal year 2011 were
$100.0 million, an increase of 1% from fiscal year 2010 sales of $99.1 million. Domestic Operations sales for fiscal year 2011 were $84.1 million, a decrease of 4% from the prior year. Sales in the domestic marketplace reflected lower sales of small
and mid-sized projects due to the economic slowdown. International Operations sales for fiscal year 2011 were $15.9 million, an increase of 38% from the prior year, as the international marketplace began its recovery from the economic slowdown.
 Our order backlog was $86.2 million at April 30, 2012, as compared to $65.7 million at April 30, 2011, and $68.9 million at
April 30, 2010.

Table of Contents
Gross profit represented 18.6%, 19.3%, and 21.6% of sales in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010,
respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 was primarily due to increased competitive pricing in the marketplace and higher costs for steel and epoxy resin raw materials. 
Operating expenses were $16.4 million, $16.1 million, and $15.6 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and 16.0%, 16.1%, and 15.7%
of sales, respectively. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in operating expenses of $378,000 attributable to the growth in International Operations and an
increase in depreciation expense of $147,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $148,000 in pension expense and a decrease of $100,000 in sales and marketing expenses. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2011 as
compared to fiscal year 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in operating expenses of $433,000 for expanded international operations, an increase of $189,000 in sales and marketing expenses, an increase of $129,000 in depreciation expense, and
an increase of $104,000 in stock option expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in pension expense of $251,000 and a decrease in bad debt expense of $101,000.  Other income was $271,000, $4,000, and $1,000 in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in other income in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to a property insurance settlement in
the amount of $156,000.  Interest expense was $445,000, $199,000, and $157,000 in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The
increase in interest expense for fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to higher levels of bank borrowings.  Income tax expense was $739,000,
$864,000, and $1,921,000 in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, or 29.1%, 29.2%, and 33.9% of pretax earnings, respectively. The effective tax rate for each of these years is lower than the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of
tax rates for the Companys international subsidiaries and the impact of state and federal tax credits.  Net earnings attributable to the
noncontrolling interest related to our two subsidiaries that are not 100% owned by the Company were $769,000, $248,000, and $178,000, for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The increases in the net earnings attributable to the
noncontrolling interest for each year were directly attributable to higher levels of net income of the subsidiaries.  Net earnings in fiscal
year 2012 were $1,031,000, or $0.40 per diluted share. Net earnings in fiscal year 2011 were $1,850,000, or $0.72 per diluted share, and net earnings in fiscal year 2010 were $3,572,000, or $1.39 per diluted share. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our
principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities, supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, certain machinery and equipment are financed by non-cancelable
operating leases or capital leases. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements, including capital expenditures, through fiscal year 2013. 
At April 30, 2012, we had advances of $6.8 million and standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million outstanding under our unsecured $15
million revolving credit facility. The credit facility matures on July 31, 2014. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information concerning our credit
facility. We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements at April 30, 2012.  The following table summarizes the cash payment
obligations for our lease arrangements and long-term loan as of April 30, 2012:  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD

Operating activities provided cash of $6.9 million in fiscal year 2012, primarily from operating earnings
and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes and an increase in inventory. Operating activities provided cash of $1.3 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily from operating earnings
and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Operating activities provided cash of $4.5 million in fiscal year 2010, primarily from operating earnings and an increase in accounts payable
and other accrued expenses, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory.  The majority of the April 30, 2012
accounts receivable balances are expected to be collected during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, with the exception of retention amounts on fixed-price contracts which are collected when the entire construction project is completed and all
retention funds are paid by the owner.  As discussed above, no further benefits have been, or will be, earned under our pension plans after
April 30, 2005, and no additional participants have been, or will be, added to the plans. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1,000,000 to the plans in fiscal year 2013. We made contributions of $402,000 and $719,000 to the plans
in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. We did not make any contributions to the plans in fiscal year 2010.  Capital expenditures were
$1.4 million, $5.2 million, and $4.2 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 were funded primarily from operations. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 was primarily
attributable to the completion of the expansion and remodeling of our Statesville facilities. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 were primarily funded by long-term bank financing. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2010 included expenditures
for the expansion of the Companys India operations and expansion of the Statesville facilities which were funded primarily from cash generated by operating activities. Fiscal year 2013 capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately
$1.0 million, with the majority of these expenditures for manufacturing equipment. The fiscal year 2013 expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by operating activities, supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit
facility.  Working capital was $23.4 million at April 30, 2012, up from $22.1 million at April 30, 2011, and the ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was 2.2-to-1.0 at April 30, 2012 and 2.1-to-1.0 at April 30, 2011. The increase in working capital for fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities. 
We paid cash dividends of $0.40, $0.40, and $0.38 per share in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. We expect to pay dividends in the future
in line with our actual and anticipated future operating results.  RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements  a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements
guidance currently included under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-element Arrangements. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: (i) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of
fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and (ii) eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance expands the
disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company adopted this standard effective May 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a
significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU
2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. This update requires the following new disclosures: (i) the amounts of significant transfer in and out of Level
1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfer; and (ii) a reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including separate information about purchases,
sales, issuance, and settlements. The update also clarifies existing requirements about fair value measurement disclosures and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  12 


Table of Contents
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) 
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. This update requires additional disclosures about the transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the sensitivity of
unobservable inputs to the fair value measurements within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and disclosure of the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items for which fair value disclosure is required but that are not measured
at fair value in the statement of financial position. ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this standard effective February 1, 2012. The adoption of this
standard did not a have a significant impact of the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In June 2011,
the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This update requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of
other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. Subsequently, in December 2011, the FASB
issued ASU 2011-12 which deferred some aspects of the June guidance that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2011. The Company adopted this standard effective May 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact of the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
OUTLOOK  Our ability to predict future
demand for our products continues to be limited given our role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors. Demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and/or current progress
in projects already under construction. Our earnings are also impacted by increased costs of raw materials, including stainless steel, wood, and epoxy resin, and whether we are able to increase product prices to customers in amounts that correspond
to such increases without materially and adversely affecting sales. Additionally, since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between the quotation of an
order and delivery of a product. We are also unable to predict the timing and strength of the global economic recovery and its short-term and long-term impact on our operations and the markets in which we compete.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 We are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates. This exposure is associated with advances outstanding
under our bank line of credit and certain lease obligations for production machinery, all of which are priced on a floating rate basis. Advances outstanding under the bank line of credit were $6.8 million at April 30, 2012. In June 2010, we
entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable on the outstanding principal balance of our $4 million term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate of 4.875%. In July 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement whereby the interest rate payable on $2 million of outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility effectively converted to a fixed interest rate of 3.9% for the period beginning August 3, 2009, and ending August 1,
2012. We entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate future interest rate risk associated with borrowings under the credit facility. We believe that our exposure to market risk is not material.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS  OF KEWAUNEE SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION  Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The
Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Management and Directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, Management concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
April 30, 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM  TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS  OF KEWAUNEE SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION  STATESVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kewaunee Scientific Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
April 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2012. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April 30, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  We were not engaged to
examine managements assertion about the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2012 included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.

100% owned by the Company. All intercompany balances, transactions, and profits have been eliminated. Included in the consolidated financial statements are net assets of $9,648,000 and $7,580,000 at April 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of the
Companys subsidiaries. Net sales by the Companys subsidiaries in the amount of $18,876,000, $15,882,000, and $11,532,000 were included in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less. During the years ended April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had cash deposits in excess of FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses from such deposits. 
Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes bank deposits of a subsidiary used for performance guarantees against customer orders. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In
circumstances where management is aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected, a specific reserve for
bad debts is estimated and recorded to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, a general reserve for bad
debts is estimated and recorded based on the customers recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding. Accounts are written off when it is clearly established that the
receivable is a bad debt. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received.  Inventories The majority
of inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The LIFO method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold; and, therefore, recognizes into operating results fluctuations
in costs of raw materials more quickly than other methods. Inventories at our international subsidiaries are measured on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is determined for financial reporting purposes principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets or, for leaseholds, over the terms of the related leases, if shorter.

 At April 30, 2012 and 2011, equipment financed under capital leases with a cost of $307,000 was included in
machinery and equipment. Management reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. If projected undiscounted cash flows
are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the potentially impaired asset, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. There were no impairments in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010. 
Other Assets Other assets at April 30, 2012 and 2011 included $3,454,000 and $3,504,000, respectively, of assets held in a trust account for
non-qualified benefit plans and $83,000 and $71,000, respectively, of cash surrender values of life insurance policies. Life insurance policies are recorded at the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract as of the date of the
Companys consolidated balance sheet with the change in cash surrender or contract value being recorded as income or expense during each period.  Use of Estimates The presentation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates impacting the accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory valuation, and pension liabilities.  Fair Value of
Financial Instruments A financial instrument is defined as cash equivalents, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument
from another party. The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and equivalents, notes receivable, mutual funds, cash surrender value of life insurance policies, capital lease obligations, and short-term borrowings. The
carrying value of these assets and liabilities approximate their fair value.  Effective May 1, 2008, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 which provides a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The
adoption of this statement had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company also adopted the deferral provisions, which delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial
assets and liabilities until our fiscal year ended April 30, 2010.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also expands disclosures
about instruments measured at fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes a fair
value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value as follows: 
 






Level 1
  
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

Level 2
  
Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

Level 3
  
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The Company maintains an executive compensation plan which includes investment assets in a rabbi trust. These assets consist of marketable securities, which are valued
using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned, and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.

The deferred compensation plan liability is equal to the individual participants account balances under the plan.

Measured on a non-recurring basis. 
  Revenue Recognition Product sales and installation revenue are recognized when all
of the following criteria have been met: (1) products have been shipped, or customers have purchased and accepted title to the goods, but because of construction delays, have requested that the Company temporarily store the finished goods on
the customers behalf; service revenue for installation of products sold is recognized as the installation services are performed, (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (3) the price to the customer is fixed, and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Deferred revenue consists of customer deposits and advance billings of the Companys
products where sales have not yet been recognized. Accounts receivable includes retainage in the amounts of $2,015,000 and $3,081,000 at April 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Because
of the nature and quality of the Companys products, any warranty issues are determined in a relatively short period after the sale and are infrequent in nature, and as such, warranty costs are immaterial to the Companys consolidated
financial position and results of operations and are expensed as incurred.  Product sales resulting from fixed-price construction contracts
involve a signed contract for a fixed price to provide the Companys laboratory furniture and fume hoods for a construction project. In these instances, the Company is usually in the role of a subcontractor, but in some cases may enter into a
contract directly with the end-user of the products. Contract arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered items. Product sales resulting from fixed-price construction contracts are generated from
multiple-element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements. The Company has determined that its multiple-element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are
(1) product sales and (2) installation services. There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
  23 


Table of Contents

for both the product sales and installation services, and allocation of arrangement consideration for each of these units is based on their relative fair values. Each of these elements represent
individual units of accounting, as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand-alone basis. The Companys products are regularly sold on a stand-alone basis to customers which provides vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value.
The fair value of installation services is separately calculated using expected costs of installation services. Many times the value of installation services is calculated using price quotations from subcontractors to the Company who perform
installation services on a stand-alone basis.  Product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by the Company
from its dealers or its stocking distributor. This category includes product sales for standard products, as well as products which require some customization. Any customization requirements are approved by the customer prior to manufacture of the
customized product. Sales from purchase orders are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board (FOB) shipping point and do not include rights of return. Accordingly, these sales are recognized at
the time of shipment.  Credit Concentration Credit risk is generally not concentrated with any one customer or industry, although the
Company does enter into large contracts with individual customers from time to time. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers. Revenues from the Companys national stocking distributor, VWR International, LLC, represented
approximately 12%, 14%, and 10% of the Companys total sales in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Income Taxes In
accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company uses the liability method in measuring the provision for income taxes and recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ASC 740 clarifies the financial statement
recognition threshold and measurement attribute of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under ASC 740, the Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC 740 only allows the
recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The Company does not have any significant uncertain tax positions at April 30, 2012 and 2011. 
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to expense in the periods incurred. Expenditures for research and
development costs were $941,000, $1,181,000, and $1,296,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, and include trade shows, training materials, sales samples, and other related
expenses. Advertising costs for the years ended April 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $344,000, $398,000, and $347,000, respectively. 
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company records derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of hedging relationships. The nature of the Companys business activities involves the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates. The Company does not enter into
derivative instruments for speculative purposes. In June 2010, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable by the Company on the outstanding balance of the term loan was effectively converted to a fixed
rate of 4.875% beginning August 2, 2010. In July 2009, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable by the Company on $2 million of outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility was
effectively converted to a fixed interest rate of 3.9% for the period beginning August 3, 2009, and ending August 1, 2012. The Company entered into these interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate future interest rate risk associated with
its loan balances and has designated these as cash flow hedges. (See Note 3.)  Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of
subsidiaries located outside the United States are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Sales, expenses, and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates for each period. Net translation gains or losses are included in other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity. The Company does not
provide for U.S. income taxes on foreign currency translation adjustments, since it does not provide for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are included
in net earnings.  Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed exercise and conversion of outstanding options under the Companys stock option plans, except when options have an antidilutive effect. Accordingly, options to purchase 253,050,
118,900, and 73,725 
  24 


Table of Contents

shares at April 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, were not included in earnings per share. These options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares at that date, and accordingly, such options would have an antidilutive effect.  The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (in thousands):

 Accounting for Stock Options Compensation costs related to all stock awards granted by the Company are charged
against income during their vesting period, under ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, for stock options. The Company granted stock options for 55,000, 136,400, and 47,200 shares during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. (See Note 5.)  Reclassifications Certain 2010 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2012 presentation in the
consolidated statements of cash flows. Such reclassifications had no impact on net earnings.  New Accounting Standards In October 2009,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements  a consensus of the FASB
Emerging Issues Task Force. It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-element Arrangements. The revised guidance primarily
provides two significant changes: (i) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and (ii) eliminates the
residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company adopted
this standard effective May 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. This update requires the following
new disclosures: (i) the amounts of significant transfer in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfer; and (ii) a reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3), including separate information about purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements. The update also clarifies existing requirements about fair value measurement disclosures and disclosures about inputs and valuation
techniques. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)  Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and
IFRSs. This update requires additional disclosures about the transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs to the fair value measurements within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,
and disclosure of the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items for which fair value disclosure is required but that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this standard effective February 1, 2012. The adoption of this standard did not a have a significant impact of the Companys consolidated financial
position or results of operations.  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  Presentation of
Comprehensive Income. This update requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but
consecutive statements. This guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. Subsequently, in December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 which deferred some aspects of the June guidance that relate to the
presentation of reclassification adjustments. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this standard effective May 1, 2012. The Company does
not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact of the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 At April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Companys international subsidiaries inventories were $1,253,000 and
$824,000, respectively, measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. If all of the Companys inventories had been determined using the FIFO method at April 30, 2012 and 2011, reported inventories would have been $1.6
million and $1.5 million greater, respectively. During fiscal year 2012, the LIFO index was higher than 100% due to higher prices for certain raw materials. This increase resulted in the addition of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs
prevailing in prior years as compared to the cost of purchases in fiscal year 2012, the effect of which increased the cost of sales by $146,000. During fiscal year 2011, the LIFO index was less than 100% due to lower prices paid for certain raw
materials. This reduction resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of purchases in fiscal year 2011, the effect of which decreased the cost of sales by
$216,000. 
Note 3Long-term Debt and Other Credit Arrangements 
In August 2011, the Company amended its existing bank agreement and increased its unsecured revolving credit facility to $15,000,000
from $14,000,000 and extended the facilitys expiration date to July 31, 2014. Monthly interest payments under the facility, as amended, are payable calculated at the 30-day LIBOR Market Interest Rate plus a variable rate ranging from
1.575% to 2.175%. The borrowing rate at April 30, 2012 was 2.414%, including a variable rate adjustment of 2.175%. The credit facility includes financial covenants with respect to certain ratios, including (a) debt-to-net worth,
(b) fixed charge coverage, and (c) asset coverage. At April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants. In July 2009, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the
interest rate payable by the Company on $2 million of outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility effectively converted to a fixed rate of 3.9% for the period beginning August 3, 2009 and ending August 1, 2012. 
At April 30, 2012, there were advances of $6.8 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, at April 30, 2012, the
Companys Asia subsidiaries had standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $2.2 million outstanding under the credit facility to guarantee performance on certain customer projects. All of the letters of credit outstanding at
April 30, 2012 have expiration dates during fiscal year 2013.  On August 2, 2010, the Company amended its existing bank agreement
covering its unsecured revolving credit facility to provide for an additional $4 million seven-year term loan secured by the Companys real property and equipment located in Statesville, North Carolina. Amounts outstanding under the term loan
were as follows as of April 30:

 The term loan requires monthly principal payments of $17,000, plus interest calculated at the 30-day LIBOR Market Index
Rate plus 1.575%, with payment of the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid interest at the term loan maturity date. In June 2010, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount that is adjusted to match the
outstanding principal on the related debt. Accordingly, the interest rate payable by the Company on the term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate of 4.875% beginning August 2, 2010. Scheduled annual principal payments for the term
loan are $200,000 for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and $2,667,000 for fiscal year 2018.  Obligations for leases classified as capital
leases were $36,000 at April 30, 2012. All obligations for capital leases are scheduled to be paid in full in fiscal year 2013.

At April 30, 2012, the Company had federal tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $63,000 expiring
beginning in 2020 and state tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $311,000, net of federal benefit, expiring beginning in 2013. After a review of the expiration schedule of the tax credits and future taxable income required to utilize such
credits before their expiration, a valuation allowance of $73,000 was recorded at April 30, 2012. 
Note 5Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation 
The stockholders approved the 2010 Stock Option Plan for Directors (the 2010 Plan) in fiscal year 2011 which allowed the
Company to grant options on 100,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Under this plan, each eligible director will be granted options to purchase 10,000 shares at the fair market value at the date of grant for a term of five years. These
options will be exercisable in four equal installments, one-fourth becoming exercisable on the next August 1 following the date of grant, and one-fourth becoming exercisable on August 1 of each of the next three years. At April 30,
2012, there were 30,000 shares available for future grants under the 2010 Plan.  The stockholders approved the 2008 Key Employee Stock Option
Plan (the 2008 Plan) in fiscal year 2009 which allowed the Company to grant options on 300,000 shares of the Companys common stock. This plan replaced the Companys previous stock option plans, but certain unexercised options
previously granted under the old plans remain outstanding. Under both plans, options were granted at not less than the fair market value at the date of grant and options are exercisable in such installments, for such terms (up to 10 years), and at
such times, as the Board of Directors may determine at the time of the grant. At April 30, 2012, there were 120,300 shares available for future grants under the 2008 Plan.  The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the Company applied the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. Inherent in the model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. For stock options granted during the fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company believes
that its historical share option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The stock options granted have the plain-vanilla characteristics as defined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 107 (SAB 107). The Company utilized the Safe Harbor option Simplified Method to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with the guidance of SAB 107 for options granted. The Company intends to continue to
utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with the guidance of SAB 110 until such time that the Company believes that its historical share option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate expected term.
The fair value of the options granted as shown below was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions:

 The stock-based compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period (4 years) for the options granted, net of tax.
The Company recorded $261,000, $139,000, and $70,000 of compensation expense net of $100,000, $86,000, and $51,000 deferred income tax benefit in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The remaining compensation expense of $333,000, net of
$212,000 deferred income tax benefit, will be recorded over the remaining vesting periods.

Note 8Retirement Benefits 
Defined Benefit Plans 
The Company has non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a significant number of salaried and hourly employees. These plans were amended as
of April 30, 2005; no further benefits have been, or will be, earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date, and no additional participants will be added to the plans. The defined benefit plan for salaried employees provides pension
benefits that are based on each employees years of service and average annual compensation during the last 10 consecutive calendar years of employment as of April 30, 2005. The benefit plan for hourly employees provides benefits at stated
amounts based on years of service as of April 30, 2005. The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its defined benefit plans. The change in projected benefit obligations and the change in fair value of plan assets for the
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for each of the years ended April 30 are summarized as follows:

 The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost during the fiscal year 2013 is $1,176,000.  The Companys funding policy is to
contribute to the plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding. Contributions of $402,000 and $719,000 were made to the plan in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. No contributions were made to the plans in fiscal
year 2010. The Company anticipates that contributions in the amount of $1,000,000 will be made to the plans in fiscal year 2013.  The
following benefit payments are expected to be paid from the benefit plans in the fiscal years ended April 30:

 The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical
markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed-income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the
long-term. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The expected long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper
consideration of diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are also reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

The Company uses a Yield Curve technique methodology to determine its GAAP discount rate. Under this
approach, future benefit payment cash flows are projected from the pension plan on a projected benefit obligation basis. The payment stream is discounted to a present value using an interest rate applicable to the timing of each respective cash
flow. The graph of these time-dependent interest rates is known as a yield curve. The interest rates comprising the Yield Curve are determined through a statistical analysis performed by the IRS and issued each month in the form of a pension
discount curve. For this purpose, the universe of possible bonds consists of a set of bonds which are designated as corporate, have high quality ratings (AAA, AA, or A) from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and have at least
$250 million in par amount outstanding on at least one day during the reporting period. A 1% increase/decrease in the discount rate for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 would decrease/increase pension expense by approximately $152,000 and $212,000,
respectively.  The Company uses a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed-income investments are used to attempt
to maximize the long-term return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a
diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations. The target allocations based on the
Companys investment policy were 70% in equity securities and 30% in fixed-income securities at both April 30, 2012 and April 30, 2011. A 1% increase/decrease in the expected return on assets for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 would
decrease/increase pension expense by approximately $149,000 and $132,000, respectively.  Plan assets by asset categories as of April 30,
2012 and 2011 were as follows:

Level 1 retirement plan assets include United States currency held by a designated trustee and equity funds
of common and preferred securities issued by domestic and foreign corporations. These equity funds are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily available.  Defined Contribution Plan  The Company has a defined contribution plan covering
substantially all salaried and hourly employees. The plan provides benefits to all employees who have attained age 21, completed three months of service, and who elect to participate. The plan provides that the Company make matching contributions
equal to 100% of the employees qualifying contribution up to 3% of the employees compensation, and make matching contributions equal to 50% of the employees contributions between 3% and 5% of the employees compensation,
resulting in a maximum employer contribution equal to 4% of the employees compensation. Additionally, the plan provides that the Company may elect to make a non-matching contribution for participants employed by the Company on December 31
of each year up to 1% of the participants qualifying compensation for that calendar year. The Companys contributions to the plan in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $664,000, $847,000, and $862,000, respectively. 
Note 9Segment Information

/s/ CHERRY, BEKAERT & HOLLAND, L.L.P.

Charlotte, North Carolina
 July 13, 2012  Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures   Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act) is properly and timely recorded, processed, summarized, and reported. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
procedures as of April 30, 2012 pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that we are able to collect, process, record, and disclose, within the required time periods, the information we are required to disclose in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In designing disclosure controls
and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives, and that management necessarily is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Nevertheless, we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, Management concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2012. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in
this Annual Report.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
