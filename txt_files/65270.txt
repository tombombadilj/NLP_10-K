Our products include control switches for electrical power and signals, connectors for electrical devices, integrated control components, switches and sensors that monitor the operation or status of a component or system, and packaging of electrical components. The Interconnect segment provides a variety of copper and fiber-optic interconnect and interface solutions for the aerospace, appliance, commercial, computer, construction, consumer, material handling, medical, military, mining, networking, storage, and telecommunications markets.  Solutions include conductive polymers, connectors, custom cable assemblies, industrial safety radio remote controls, optical and copper transceivers, personal computer and express card packaging and terminators, solid-state field effect interface panels, and thick film inks.  Services include the design and installation of fiber optic and copper infrastructure systems, and manufacturing active and passive optical components. The Power Products segment manufactures braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated bus devices, custom power-product assemblies, high-current low voltage flexible power cabling systems and powder coated bus bars that are used in various markets and applications, including aerospace, computers, industrial and power conversion, inverters and battery systems, insulated gate bipolar transistor solutions, military, telecommunications, and transportation. The Other segment includes a designer and manufacturer of magnetic torque sensing products, and independent laboratories that provide services for qualification testing and certification, and analysis of electronic and optical components. Financial results by segment are summarized in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.Sales.  The following table reflects the percentage of net sales of the segments of the Company for the last three fiscal years.  Year Ended April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 May 1, 2010Automotive58.0% 52.8% 53.4%Interconnect27.7% 32.4% 33.3%Power Products11.3% 11.8% 10.8%Other3.0% 3.0% 2.5% Our sales activities are directed by sales managers who are supported by field application engineers and other engineering personnel who work with customers to design our products into their systems.  Our field application engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products.  Our products are sold through in-house sales staff and through independent manufacturers’ representatives with offices throughout the world.  Information about our sales and operations in 1 Table of Contentsdifferent geographic regions is summarized in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.  Sales are made primarily to OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers as well as selling partners and distributors. Sources and Availability of Materials.  Principal materials that we purchase include application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, light-emitting diode (LED) displays, plastic molding materials, precious metals, and silicon die castings.  All of these items are available from several suppliers and we generally rely on more than one supplier for each item.   We normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules.  We experienced price increases on some resins as well as silver in fiscal 2012, however copper prices remained constant.  In fiscal 2011, we experienced some shortages for specific electrical components.  Additionally in fiscal 2011, we experienced significant price increases for copper, precious metals and petroleum-based raw materials.  We did not experience significant price increases in fiscal 2010. Patents; Licensing Agreements.  We have numerous United States and foreign patents and license agreements covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, several of which are considered significant to our business.   Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued. Seasonality.  A significant portion of our business is dependent on automotive sales and the vehicle production schedules of our customers.  The automotive market is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, interest rates, fuel prices and consumer spending patterns.  Material Customers.  During the fiscal year ended April 28, 2012, shipments to Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and General Motors Corporation (“GM”), or their tiered suppliers, represented 18.7% and 18.5%, respectively,  of consolidated net sales.  Such shipments included a wide variety of our automotive component products.Backlog. Our backlog of orders was approximately $87.9 million at April 28, 2012, and $82.2 million at April 30, 2011.  We expect that most of the backlog at April 28, 2012 will be shipped within fiscal 2013. Competitive Conditions.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments.  We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas; many of these competitors have greater resources and sales.  Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products. Research and Development.  We maintain a research and development program involving a number of professional employees who devote a majority of their time to the enhancement of existing products and to the development of new products and processes.  Senior management of our Company participates directly in the program.  Expenditures for such activities amounted to $20.4 million, $19.5 million and $18.4 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Environmental Matters.  Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.  Currently, we do not have any environmental related lawsuits or material administrative proceedings pending against us.  Further information as to environmental matters affecting us is presented in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Employees.  At April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, we had 3,143 and 2,743 employees, respectively.  We also from time to time employ part-time employees and hire independent contractors.  As of April 28, 2012, our employees from our Malta and Mexico facilities, which account for approximately 64% of our total number of employees, are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our employee relations are good. Segment Information and Foreign Sales.  Information about our operations by segment and in different geographic regions is summarized in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Available Information.  We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet site(www.sec.gov) that contains periodic reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding Methode. 2 Table of ContentsFinancial and other information can also be accessed on the investor relations section of our website at www.methode.com. We make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.   Also posted on our website are the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct and the charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Technology Committee. Copies of these documents are also available free of charge by sending a request to Methode Electronics, Inc., 7401 West Wilson Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60706, Attention: Investor Relations Department.  Information on our website is not incorporated into this Form 10-K or our other securities filings and is not a part of them. Certifications.  As required by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), we delivered to the NYSE a certification signed by our Chief Executive Officer, Donald W. Duda, certifying that Mr. Duda was not aware of any violation by the Company of the NYSE’s corporate governance listing standards as of October 20, 2011. As required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 302 certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 1A.  Risk Factors Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.  We undertake no duty to update any such forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or changes in our expectations.  Our business is highly dependent upon two large automotive customers and specific makes and models of automobiles.  Our results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive, appliance, computer and communications industries, such as general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, consumer spending patterns and technological changes.   Other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include the following risk factors.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that our management currently believe to be insignificant may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report because these factors could cause our actual results and condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements in this report are subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities laws and are made as of the date of this report. We depend on a small number of large customers, specifically two large automotive customers.  If we were to lose either of these customers or experienced a significant decline in the volume or price of products purchased by these customers, or if either of the customers declare bankruptcy, our future results could be adversely affected. During the year ended April 28, 2012, shipments to Ford and GM, or their tiered suppliers, represented 18.7% and 18.5%, respectively,  of our consolidated net sales.  The contracts we have entered into with these customers provide for supplying the customers’ requirements for a particular model, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally three to seven years. Therefore, the loss of a contract for a major model or a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by Ford or GM could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also compete to supply products for successor models and are subject to the risk that Ford or GM will not select us to produce products on any such model, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, appliance, computer and communications industries, we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries. Our components are found in the primary end markets of the automotive, communications (including information processing and storage, networking equipment, wireless and terrestrial voice/data systems), aerospace, rail and other transportation industries, appliances and the consumer and industrial equipment markets.  Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we experienced slow-downs in all significant segments due to the recession.  Any adverse occurrence, including additional industry slowdown, recession, rising interest rates, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers’ production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 3 Table of ContentsDownturns in the automotive industry or the bankruptcy of certain automotive customers could reduce the sales and profitability of our business. Currently, approximately 58% of our business is dependent on automotive sales and the vehicle production schedules of our customers.  The automotive market is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, interest rates and consumer spending patterns.  Any significant reduction in vehicle production by our customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.In addition, we have significant receivable balances related to these customers that would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy.  Prior to fiscal 2012, due to the financial stresses within the global economy, which directly affected the worldwide automotive industry, certain automakers and suppliers declared bankruptcy.  In the event of the bankruptcy of any of our customers with significant receivable balances, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our technology-based business and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive.  If we are unable to compete effectively, our sales will decline. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments.  We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas; many of these competitors have greater resources and sales.  Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products.  Competition may intensify further if more companies enter the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We face risks relating to our international operations Recently, there has been global concern over the overall macroeconomic environment in Europe, the currency exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the banking system in the European Economic Community, the ability of European consumers to access credit to finance automobile purchases and the ability of the European Central Bank to provide enough liquidity and backing to any countries experiencing sovereign debt issues, such as Greece, Italy and Spain.  Any or all of these factors could negatively impact our European operations.In addition, because approximately 59% of our sales come from our international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may adversely affect us, including: fluctuations in exchange rates; political and economic instability; expropriation, or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards; less favorable intellectual property laws; health conditions and standards; currency controls; increases in duties and taxes; high levels of inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations; and  communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage to some of our foreign competitors. We are dependent on the availability and price of materials. We require substantial amounts of materials, including petroleum-based products, glass, copper and precious metals, application-specific integrated circuits and light-emitting diode (LED) displays, and all materials we require are purchased from third party sources. The availability and prices of materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. Any change in the availability of, or price for, these materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We experienced price increases on some resins as well as silver in fiscal 2012, however copper prices remained constant.We experienced significant price increases in fiscal 2011 for copper, precious metals and petroleum-based raw materials and shortages for certain electrical components. Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their 4 Table of Contentsmanufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes, which would adversely affect our business. The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes. Specifically, end markets for electronic components and assemblies are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards.  These changes could render our existing products unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and other expenses. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products vary, may change and are difficult to estimate. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to  a variety of factors, including design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects may result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects may result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products that are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability, however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects or recalls and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another person’s intellectual property, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We have numerous United States and foreign patents and license agreements covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, several of which are considered significant to our business.  Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.  Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.  The loss of any significant patents and trade secrets could adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, share price. We have and may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay a penalty for past infringement and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation. We are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.  Over the past several years we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, pressure to lower our prices. In order to maintain our margins, we must strive to increase volumes and reduce our costs. Continuing pressures to reduce our prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 5 Table of ContentsWe were awarded new North American automotive business in fiscal 2011 for a program that will not begin production until the end of fiscal 2013.  We anticipate that it will take a significant amount of our cash and resources to launch this program.During fiscal 2011, we were awarded a next generation center stack program for multiple GM vehicle platforms.  The program is expected to be manufactured in our plant in Monterrey, Mexico.  We anticipate that the center stack program for GM will require a significant amount of cash for the purchase of equipment, tooling and initial inventory as well as additional staffing for the development and launching of the program.  We expect to begin production and generate sales on this program in late fiscal 2013.  Therefore, we anticipate our cash balances will likely decline due to the launching of this program without a corresponding increase in sales.We currently have a significant amount of our cash located outside the U.S.We believe our current world-wide cash balances together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations will be sufficient to support current operations.  However, due to the shifting of operations from the U.S. to foreign locations, a significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S.  Except for a planned dividend from a foreign subsidiary, no provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed net income of foreign operations, as we currently expect them to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations.  However, if we change our position and the cash is repatriated back to the U.S., it may have an adverse affect on our U.S. federal and state taxes, by lowering our net operating loss positions or potentially creating a tax liability.A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating results. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, mainly in Europe and China.  Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Chinese yuan in which we generate revenue and incur expenses.  Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.We may acquire businesses or divest business operations. These transactions may pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We intend to explore opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, a reduction of cash or the incurrence of debt. We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management’s attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business.  Failure to timely complete or to consummate a divestiture may negatively affect the valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.We could suffer significant business interruptions.  Our operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods, or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease or failures of our management information or other systems. If a business interruption occurs, our business could be materially and adversely affected.Unfavorable tax law changes may adversely affect results. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions.  Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the tax laws. 6 Table of ContentsWe cannot ensure that the newly acquired Eetrex and Advanced Molding and Decoration businesses will be successful or that we can implement and profit from any new applications of the acquired technology.  We acquired 70% of Eetrex during fiscal 2011 and an additional 20% during fiscal 2012.  As a result of this acquisition, we now design and manufacture chargers, inverters and battery systems for hybrid and plug-in hybrid electronic vehicles.  The market for these products is competitive and rapidly developing.  If we do not keep pace with technological innovations in the industry, our products may not be competitive and we may not benefit from future revenue and earnings.  Furthermore, while we intend to expand the Eetrex business by integrating the technology into additional applications, we can make no guarantee that such ventures will be successful or profitable.We acquired certain assets and liabilities from Nypro Monterrey, S. de R.L. from Nypro, Inc. in September, 2011.  We operate this injection molding and painting business under the name of Advanced Molding and Decoration, S.A. de C.V. (AMD).

On August 26, 2009, Delphi notified us that effective September 10, 2009, our supply arrangement was terminated. We are contesting Delphi’s right to terminate this long-term supply arrangement and the parties are engaged in litigation regarding this supply agreement and our related intellectual property.In March 2010, DPH Holdings Corp. and certain of its affiliated debtors, as successors to Delphi Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“Delphi”), served the Company with a complaint seeking to recover approximately $19.7 million in alleged preference payments that Delphi made to the Company within the 90-day period preceding Delphi’s bankruptcy filing in October 2005 (the “Complaint”).  Delphi is pursuing similar preference complaints against a number of other, unrelated third-parties.  The Complaint, dated September 28, 2007, was originally filed under seal with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (titled as Delphi Corporation, et al. v. Methode Electronics, Inc, Adversary Proceeding No. 07-2432) and pursuant to certain court orders, the Complaint was not unsealed and served upon the Company until March 2010.  The Company has filed a joinder to third-parties’ motions to dismiss the Delphi preference complaints based on violations of due process and other defenses connected to the unusual manner that Delphi filed and served the preference complaints.   Additionally, the Company possesses several other substantive defenses to the Complaint including, but not limited to, the affirmative defenses available under the Bankruptcy Code, statute of limitations, setoff, waiver and estoppel.  The Bankruptcy Court ruled on July 22, 2010 that the Complaint did not satisfy certain pleading requirements and dismissed the Complaint without prejudice, granting Delphi leave to re-file an amended complaint.  The Court overruled the Company's defenses to the proposed amended complaint relating primarily to pleading issues, and ordered that other defenses would be addressed in subsequent proceedings.  Although the outcome of potential legal actions and claims cannot be determined, it is the opinion of our management, based on the information available, that we have adequate reserves for these liabilities and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of ContentsExecutive Officers of the Registrant Name Age Offices and Positions Held and Length of Service as OfficerDonald W.

In addition, this segment incurred costs of $3.3 million related to a vendor's production and delivery issues, compared to $2.3 million in fiscal 2011.  The Power Products segment reported costs of $2.4 million for new product development for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.9 million for fiscal 2011.  Fiscal 2011 includes a charge of $1.3 million in our Automotive segment for negotiated program termination costs for certain products manufactured in our Malta automotive facility, as well as an inventory and equipment charge of $0.4 million relating to the customer cancellation of certain products manufactured in the U.S. in our Power Products segment. Gross Margins.  Consolidated gross margins decreased $6.1 million, or 6.8%, to $83.1 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to $89.2 million for fiscal 2011.  Gross margins as a percentage of net sales were 17.9% for fiscal 2012, compared to 20.8% for fiscal 2011.  Gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to new program and product launch costs and increased costs related to a vendor's production and delivery issues.  In addition, gross margins were negatively impacted by increased sales of automotive product that has higher material cost due to the current high percentage of purchased content.  Gross margins were negatively impacted in fiscal 2011 for negotiated program termination costs for certain products as well as costs associated with the customer cancellation of certain products.Selling and Administrative Expenses.  Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $0.9 million, or 1.3%, to $69.9 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $70.8 million for fiscal 2011.  During fiscal 2011, we recorded an expense of $2.1 million for litigation regarding unsecured claims sold to Blue Angel LLC, related to the Delphi bankruptcy.  Stock award amortization expense increased by $1.0 million, to $4.0 million for fiscal 2012, compared with $3.0 million for fiscal 2011.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million in fiscal 2012 due to the acquisitions of Eetrex and AMD.  Legal expenses decreased $0.7 million, to $6.0 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $6.7 million in fiscal 2011, primarily due to lower Delphi litigation expenses, partially offset with legal expenses related to the AMD acquisition.  Fiscal 2011 includes income of $0.5 million received for grants at one of our Malta facilities.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.0% for fiscal 2012 from 16.5% for fiscal 2011. Amortization of Intangibles.  Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.6 million, or 25.0%, to $1.8 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $2.4 million for fiscal 2011.  The decrease is primarily due to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2011.Interest (Income)/Expense, Net.  Interest (income)/expense, net was income of $0.3 million for fiscal 2012, compared to an expense of  $0.2 million for fiscal 2011.Other Expense, Net.  Other expense, net decreased $1.0 million, or 76.9%,  to $0.3 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to $1.3 million for fiscal 2011.  Other income included income of $0.4 million and $1.2 million for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively, related to life insurance policies in connection with an employee deferred compensation plan.  Fiscal 2012 includes a gain of $0.3 million related to the acquisition of AMD.  All other amounts for both periods relate to expenses for currency rate fluctuations.  The functional currencies of our international operations are the British pound, Chinese yuan, Euro, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.  Some foreign operations have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, primarily sales in U.S. dollars and Euros, creating exchange rate sensitivities. Income Tax (Benefit)/Expense.  Income tax (benefit)/expense increased by $7.3 million to an expense of $3.2 million for fiscal 2012, compared to a benefit of $4.1 million for fiscal 2011.  The income tax expense for fiscal 2012 relates to income taxes on foreign profits of $3.1 million and $2.0 million for foreign taxes on a foreign dividend.  In addition, fiscal 2012 includes a benefit of $1.9 million related to tax credits from our Malta facility.  Fiscal 2011 includes a benefit for an intraperiod tax allocation related to the sale of Optokon of $3.5 million and a benefit of $2.7 million related to the expiration of uncertain tax positions and interest from prior periods, partially offset by a net income tax expense on foreign profits of $2.1 million. Gain on the Sale of Discontinued Business, Net of Tax.  In March 2011, we sold our 75% ownership in Optokon, to the minority shareholder for $10.0 million.  The net assets of our 75% ownership had a book value of $9.9 million. We recorded a gain of $4.1 million for sale of the net assets, primarily attributable to the cumulative translation gains since the date of the initial investment.  We also recorded income taxes related to the sale of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain net after tax of $0.6 million.  The tax expense was based on the amount sold of $10.0 million less our initial investment of $1.2 million, resulting in a taxable gain of $8.8 million.  In the sale, we received $5.9 million in cash as well as a collateralized note for $4.1 million.15Net Income Attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc.   Net income attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc. decreased $11.1 million, to $8.4 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $19.5 million for fiscal 2011.  The decrease is primarily due to the higher expenses for new product development and product launches, increased stock award amortization expense, increased costs related to a vendor's production and delivery issues, higher tax expense, higher selling and administrative expenses due to acquisitions, the absence of a grant from our Malta facility and lower life insurance proceeds and the gain on the sale of the Optokon business in fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher sales, lower legal expenses and the absence of expense for Blue Angel claims and the absence of negotiated cancellation costs and inventory charges.Operating Segments Automotive Segment Results Below is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:(in millions)  April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 Net Change Net ChangeNet sales$271.6 $226.0 $45.6 20.2 %        Cost of products sold233.3 186.3 47.0 25.2 %        Gross margins38.3 39.7 (1.4) (3.5)%        Selling and administrative expenses28.3 26.4 1.9 7.2 %Income from operations$10.0 $13.3 $(3.3) (24.8)%        Percent of sales:April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011    Net sales100.0% 100.0%    Cost of products sold85.9% 82.4%    Gross margins14.1% 17.6%    Selling and administrative expenses10.4% 11.7%    Income from operations3.7% 5.9%    Net Sales.  Automotive segment net sales increased  $45.6 million, or 20.2%, to $271.6 million for fiscal 2012, from $226.0 million for fiscal 2011.  Net sales increased in North America, Europe and Asia by 108.5%, 5.2% and 3.4%, respectively.  The increase in North America is primarily due to increased sales for our Ford Center Console Program and transmission lead-frame assembly as well as sales from the AMD business acquired in September 2011.   The increase in Asia is due to increases in our transmission lead-frame and steering angle sensor products and the increase in Europe is primarily due to currency fluctuations.

The net assets of our 75% ownership had a book value of $9.9 million. We recorded a gain of $4.1 million to sale of the net assets, primarily attributable to the cumulative translation gains since the date of the initial investment.  We also recorded income taxes related to the sale of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain net of taxes of $0.6 million.  The tax expense was based on the amount sold of $10.0 million less our initial investment of $1.2 million, resulting in a taxable gain of $8.8 million.  In the sale, we received $5.9 million in cash as well as a collateralized note for $4.1 million. Net Income Attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc.  Net income attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc. increased $5.8 million, or 42.3%, to $19.5 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $13.7 million for fiscal 2010.  The increase is primarily due to higher net sales and gross margins, no restructuring expenses, gain on the sale of a business, partially offset by the Blue Angel unsecured claims charge, higher stock option and stock award amortization, lower tax benefits, the one-time reversal of pricing contingencies in fiscal 2010, customer negotiated cancellation and other customer cancellation costs, costs related to a certain vendor's production and delivery issues, higher development costs and higher foreign currency exchange expenses in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.22Operating Segments Automotive Segment Results Below is a table summarizing results for the years ended:(in millions)("N/M" equals not meaningful)  April 30,2011 May 1,2010 Net Change Net ChangeNet sales$226.0 $203.2 $22.8 11.2%        Cost of products sold186.3 166.7 19.6 11.8%        Gross margins39.7 36.5 3.2 8.8%        Restructuring— 5.6 (5.6) N/MSelling and administrative expenses26.4 19.6 6.8 34.7%Income from operations$13.3 $11.3 $2.0 17.7%        Percent of sales:April 30,2011 May 1,2010    Net sales100.0% 100.0%    Cost of products sold82.4% 82.0%    Gross margins17.6% 18.0%    Restructuring—% 2.8%    Selling and administrative expenses11.7% 9.6%    Income from operations5.9% 5.6%          Below is a table showing the changes in the North America automotive net sales in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010:North America Automotive net sales for fiscal 2010$55.7Termination of certain Ford legacy products at our Reynosa, Mexico facility(18.2)Termination of Delphi supply agreement(14.1)Transfer of transmission lead-frame product to Shanghai, China facility(11.4)Subtotal12.0Ford center console program21.4North American Automotive net sales for fiscal 2011$33.4Net Sales.  Automotive segment net sales increased $22.8 million, or 11.2%, to $226.0 million for fiscal 2011, from $203.2 million for fiscal 2010.  Net sales increased in Asia by 107.6%, to $77.0 million and increased in Europe by 4.8%, to $111.6 million, however, net sales from North America declined by 40.0%, to $33.4 million in  fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.  The increase in Asia is primarily due to increased sales for the transmission lead-frame and steering angle sensor products.  In North America, there were no sales to Delphi Corporation in fiscal 2011, as compared to net sales of $14.1 million in fiscal 2010 due to the cancellation of the supply agreement on September 10, 2009.  Net sales also declined in North America by $11.4 million due to the planned transfer of production from our U.S. facility to our facility in Shanghai, China in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, as well as by $18.2 million due to the termination of production of certain Ford legacy products at our Reynosa, Mexico facility at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010, as well as declines in sales of service parts.  The decrease in North America automotive sales was partially offset by sales of $21.4 million in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, due to the Ford Center Console Program, which launched at the end of the first quarter.  Net sales benefited by $1.7 million in fiscal 2010, related to a one-time reversal of pricing contingencies which were accrued over several years and were no longer required.    Included in net sales is other income, which consisted primarily of earnings from engineering design fees and royalties.  Other income increased $0.1 million, or 2.6%, to $4.0 million for fiscal 2011, from $3.9 million for fiscal 2010.  Translation of foreign operations net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased reported net sales by $4.1 million, or 2.0%, due to average currency rates in fiscal 2011, compared to the average currency rates in fiscal 2010.23 Cost of Products Sold.  Automotive segment cost of products sold increased $19.6 million, or 11.8%, to $186.3 million for fiscal 2011, from $166.7 million for fiscal 2010.  Fiscal 2011 includes a charge of $1.3 million for negotiated program termination costs for certain products manufactured in our Malta facility.  In addition, we incurred $2.3 million in additional costs due to a vendor's production and delivery issues for new products during fiscal 2011.  The Automotive segment cost of products sold as a percentage of sales were 82.4% in fiscal 2011, compared to 82.0% in fiscal 2010.  The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales were also due to customer program cancellation charges and costs related to a certain vendor's production and delivery issues and the loss of the Delphi business, partially offset by higher sales volumes and improvements in cost of products sold in Asia.  In addition, increasing costs of products sold as a percentage of sales primarily relates to the development of new products in North America, which are expected to begin shipping in future periods.  Included in the cost of products sold for fiscal 2010 is $0.7 million of asset write-downs relating to the termination of the Delphi supply agreement. Gross Margins.  Automotive segment gross margins increased $3.2 million, or 8.8%, to $39.7 million for fiscal 2011, as compared to $36.5 million for fiscal 2010.  The Automotive segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were 17.6% for fiscal 2011, as compared to 18.0% for fiscal 2010.  Gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, due to the loss of the Delphi business, increasing costs on the remaining North American business, customer program cancellation charges and costs related to a vendor's production and delivery issues, partially offset by higher sales volumes and cost efficiencies in Asia. Restructuring.   During fiscal 2010, we completed all of our planned restructuring initiatives.  During fiscal 2010, we recorded a total restructuring charge of $5.6 million, which consisted of $3.4 million for employee severance, $1.4 million for accelerated depreciation and $0.8 million for other costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $6.8 million, or 34.7%, to $26.4 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $19.6 million for fiscal 2010.  During fiscal 2011, we recorded a settlement of $2.1 million for litigation regarding unsecured claims sold to Blue Angel LLC in June 2006, related to the Delphi bankruptcy.  See the Overview section for more information regarding this matter.  Delphi litigation expenses decreased $1.0 million, to $4.8 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $5.8 million for fiscal 2010.  In addition, selling and marketing expenses increased in our North American and Asian automotive businesses primarily due to new product development efforts in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% for fiscal 2011 and 9.6% for fiscal 2010.     Income From Operations.  Automotive segment income from operations increased $2.0 million or 17.7%, to $13.3 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $11.3 million for fiscal 2010 due to the lack of restructuring charges, higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by the Blue Angel unsecured claims charge,  the one-time reversal of pricing contingencies in fiscal 2010, higher selling and marketing expenses, increased development costs in North America, and negotiated program termination costs in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010. 24Interconnect Segment Results Below is a table summarizing results for the years ended:(in millions)("N/M" equals not meaningful)  April 30,2011 May 1,2010 Net Change Net ChangeNet sales$138.8 $124.2 $14.6 11.8 %        Cost of products sold96.8 88.6 8.2 9.3 %        Gross margins42.0 35.6 6.4 18.0 %        Restructuring— 1.6 (1.6) N/MSelling and administrative expenses22.0 23.0 (1.0) (4.3)%Income from operations$20.0 $11.0 $9.0 81.8 %        Percent of sales:April 30,2011 May 1,2010    Net sales100.0% 100.0%    Cost of products sold69.7% 71.3%    Gross margins30.3% 28.7%    Restructuring—% 1.3%    Selling and administrative expenses15.9% 18.5%    Income from operations14.4% 8.9%     Net Sales.  Interconnect segment net sales increased $14.6 million, or 11.8%, to $138.8 million for fiscal 2011, from $124.2 million for fiscal 2010.  Net sales increased 12.5% and 19.3% in North America and Europe, respectively, however, net sales declined in Asia by 2.4% in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.  The increase in North America is due to increased sales for our data, sensor and radio remote control devices and the increase in Europe is due to increased sales for radio remote control devices.  The decrease in Asia relates to lower sales for legacy products due to the planned exit of this product line in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.  Translation of foreign operations net sales in fiscal 2011 decreased reported net sales by $0.1 million, due to average currency rates in fiscal 2011, compared to the average currency rates in fiscal 2010. Cost of Products Sold.  Interconnect segment cost of products sold increased $8.2 million, or 9.3%, to $96.8 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $88.6 million for fiscal 2010.  Interconnect segment cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 69.7% for fiscal 2011, compared to 71.3% for fiscal 2010.  The decrease is primarily due to a favorable change in sales mix within the segment as well as the overall increase in net sales in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010. Gross Margins.  Interconnect segment gross margins increased $6.4 million, or 18.0%, to $42.0 million for fiscal 2011, as compared to $35.6 million for fiscal 2010.  Gross margins as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for fiscal 2011, from 28.7% for fiscal 2010.  The increase in gross margins as a percentage of net sales primarily relates to higher sales volumes as well as a favorable change in sales mix within the segment in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010. Restructuring.  During fiscal 2010, we completed all of our planned restructuring initiatives.  During fiscal 2010, we recorded a total restructuring charge of $1.6 million, which consisted of $0.7 million for employee severance, $0.2 million for accelerated depreciation and $0.7 million for other costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses.  Selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 4.3%, to $22.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $23.0 million for fiscal 2010.  The decrease is due to lower professional fees in our remote control business.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.9%, due to higher sales volumes, in fiscal 2011, from 18.5% for fiscal 2010. 25Income From Operations.  Interconnect segment income from operations increased $9.0 million, or 81.8%, to $20.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $11.0 million for fiscal 2010, due to increased net sales and gross margins, no restructuring expenses and lower selling and administrative expenses.Power Products Segment Results Below is a table summarizing results for the years ended:(in millions)("N/M" equals not meaningful)  April 30,2011 May 1,2010 Net Change Net ChangeNet sales$50.4 $40.5 $9.9 24.4%        Cost of products sold39.8 30.0 9.8 32.7%        Gross margins10.6 10.5 0.1 1.0%        Restructuring— 0.6 (0.6) N/MSelling and administrative expenses7.0 6.5 0.5 7.7%Income from operations$3.6 $3.4 $0.2 5.9%        Percent of sales:April 30,2011 May 1,2010    Net sales100.0% 100.0%    Cost of products sold79.0% 74.1%    Gross margins21.0% 25.9%    Restructuring—% 1.5%    Selling and administrative expenses13.9% 16.0%    Income from operations7.1% 8.4%     Net Sales.  Power Products segment net sales increased $9.9 million, or 24.4%, to $50.4 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $40.5 million for fiscal 2010.  Net sales increased in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 by 4.6% in North America and by 65.2% in Asia.  The increase in Asia was due to an increased demand for our busbar products.  In North America, higher demand for our flexible cabling and heat sink products was offset with lower demand for our busbar products.  We also began selling busbar products in Europe in fiscal 2011, which accounted for $2.6 million in net sales, compared to no net sales in fiscal 2010. Cost of Products Sold.  Power Products segment cost of products sold increased $9.8 million, or 32.7%, to $39.8 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $30.0 million for fiscal 2010.  The Power Products segment cost of products sold as a percentage of sales increased to 79.0% for fiscal 2011, from 74.1% for fiscal 2010.  Fiscal 2011 includes an inventory and equipment charge of $0.4 million, relating to the customer cancellation of certain products manufactured in the U.S.  The increase in the cost of products sold as a percentage of sales is primarily due to new product development, as well as customer cancellation charges, partially offset by lower costs in our Asian business. Gross Margins.  Power Products segment gross margins increased $0.1 million, or 1.0%, to $10.6 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $10.5 million for fiscal 2010.  Gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased to 21.0% for fiscal 2011 from 25.9% for fiscal 2010.  The decrease in gross margins as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the increased costs due to new product development for the Eetrex products, as well as customer cancellation charges, partially offset by lower costs in our Asian business. Restructuring.   During fiscal 2010, we completed all of our planned restructuring initiatives.  During fiscal 2010, we recorded a restructuring  charge of $0.6 million, which consisted of $0.1 million for employee severance and $0.5 million related to other costs.26Selling and Administrative Expenses.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 7.7%, to $7.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $6.5 million for fiscal 2010.  Selling and administrative expenses increased due to increased selling and professional fees in our U.S.-based busbar and heat sink businesses as well as increased expenses due to the purchase of 70% of Eetrex in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 13.9% in fiscal 2011, from 16.0% for fiscal 2010. Income From Operations.  Power Products segment income from operations increased $0.2 million, or 5.9%, to $3.6 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $3.4 million for fiscal 2010, due to higher net sales and gross profit, no restructuring charges, partially offset with expenses related to new product development and expenses related to Eetrex, customer cancellation charges and higher selling and administrative expenses. Other Segment

torque-sensing business increased 178.2% in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010.  Net sales from our testing facilities decreased 13.8% in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of Products Sold.  Other segment cost of products sold increased $2.5 million to $12.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $9.5 million for fiscal 2010.  Cost of products sold as a percentage of sales decreased to 92.3% in fiscal 2011, compared to 102.2% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased sales from our torque-sensing business. Gross Margins.  The Other segment gross margins increased to $1.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to a loss of $0.2 million for fiscal 2010.  Gross margins as a percentage of sales increased to 7.7% in fiscal 2011, compared to negative 2.2% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased sales from our torque-sensing business. Selling and Administrative Expenses.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, or 42.9%, to $3.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2010.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.1% for fiscal 2011, from 22.6% for fiscal 2010. Loss from Operations.  The Other segment loss from operations decreased $0.3 million, to $2.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $2.3 million for fiscal 2010, due to increased sales and gross profit, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. 27Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our current world-wide cash balances together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations will be sufficient to support current operations.  However, due to the shifting of operations from the U.S. to foreign locations, a significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S.  Of the total cash and cash equivalents, as of April 28, 2012, $79.3 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. of which the majority of this amount is deemed to be permanently reinvested and therefore not available to fund our domestic operations.  We currently have $65.4 million of net operating loss carry-forwards in the U.S. which would reduce the cash tax obligation upon any future repatriation of funds. During fiscal 2011, we were awarded a next generation center stack program for multiple GM vehicle platforms. The program will be manufactured in our plant in Monterrey, Mexico.  We anticipate this program will require a significant amount of cash for the purchase of equipment, tooling and initial inventory as well as additional staffing for the development and launching of the program.  We expect to begin production and generate sales on these programs in late fiscal 2013.  Therefore, we anticipate our cash balances will likely decline due to the launching of this programs without a corresponding increase in sales.Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions, has a maturity of February 25, 2016.  The new credit facility is in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million, with an option to increase the principal amount by an additional $25.0 million subject to customary conditions and approval of the lender(s) providing new commitment(s).  The credit facility provides for variable rates of interest based on the type of borrowing and the Company's debt to EBITDA financial ratio.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  The interest rate on the credit agreement is 1.5% plus LIBOR.  At April 28, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants of the agreement.  During fiscal 2012, we had borrowings of $52.0 million and payments of $4.7 million, under this credit facility, which included $0.7 million of interest payments.   As of April 28, 2012, there was an outstanding balance of $48.0 million against the credit facility.  There was $27.0 million available to borrow under the credit agreement as of April 28, 2012, which does not include the option to increase the principal amount.Operating cash flow is summarized below (in millions):  Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 May 1, 2010Net income$8.1 $19.2 $13.8Depreciation and amortization16.2 15.8 19.4Changes in operating assets and liabilities(1.9) (16.1) (11.5)Other non-cash items2.4 (1.9) 5.7Cash flow from operations$24.8 $17.0 $27.4 Operating Activities — Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $7.8 million to $24.8 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $17.0 million for fiscal 2011, despite net income decline of $11.1 million, to $8.1 million, compared to $19.2 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in cash generated from the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our trade accounts receivable used $13.5 million of cash in fiscal 2012 due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.  Inventory and prepaid and other expenses used cash of $4.4 million and accounts payable and accrued expenses generated $25.2 million, due to the timing of accounts payable payments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the increase in deferred income tax liabilities.  In fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations increased by $13.2 million due to tax refunds received relating to prior periods.Operating Activities — Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.4 million to $17.0 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $27.4 million for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in cash use related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities and lower depreciation and amortization non-cash add-back, partially offset by an increase in net income in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Our trade accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable in aggregate used $27.0 million of cash flow during fiscal 2011, compared to $11.5 million of cash used for fiscal 282010.  The increased use of cash reflects increased accounts receivable levels, partially offset by increased accounts payable levels, associated with increased business activity, as well as management's decision to increase inventory levels on some raw material and components that historically we have experienced shortages in the marketplace.  In fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations increased by $13.2 million due to tax refunds received relating to prior periods. Investing Activities — Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.9 million to $32.1 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $16.2 million for fiscal 2011. Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by $10.5 million, to $25.7 million for fiscal 2012, compared to $15.2 million for fiscal 2011.  The increase is primarily due to equipment purchased for new programs that launched in fiscal 2012 and for the programs scheduled to launch in late fiscal 2013.  In addition, property, plant and equipment increased due to plant expansions in Europe, China and in the U.S.  In fiscal 2012, we purchased a business, Advanced Molding and Decoration, for $6.6 million. In fiscal 2011, we made an additional investment of $2.4 million in Eetrex, for a total ownership in the business of 70%.  Also in fiscal 2011, we received $1.5 million for life insurance proceeds in connection with the deferred compensation plan. Investing Activities — Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net cash used in investing activities increased $8.3 million to $16.1 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $7.8 million for fiscal 2010. Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by $5.8 million, to $15.2 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $9.4 million for fiscal 2010.  In fiscal 2011, we made an additional investment of $2.4 million in Eetrex, for a total ownership in the business of 70%.  Also in fiscal 2011, we received $1.5 million for life insurance proceeds in connection with the deferred compensation plan, compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2010. Financing Activities — Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities increased $47.2 million to cash provided of $37.9 million in fiscal 2012, compared to a cash use of $9.3 million in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, the Company had net borrowings against the credit facility of $48.0 million, compared to no net borrowings in fiscal 2011.  We paid dividends of $10.4 million and $10.3 million for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.  In addition, fiscal 2012 included $0.3 million of proceeds for the exercise of stock options, compared to $1.0 million for fiscal 2011.Financing Activities — Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net cash used for financing activities decreased $1.0 million to $9.3 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $10.3 million for fiscal 2010. We paid dividends of $10.3 million and $10.4 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.  In addition, fiscal 2011 included $1.0 million of proceeds for the exercise of stock options, compared to $0.2 million for fiscal 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments, as of April 28, 2012 (in thousands):  Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 yearsOperating leases$9,781 $3,751 $3,880 $593 $1,557Long term debt48,000 — — 48,000 —Purchase obligations54,352 54,303 49 — —Deferred compensation4,922 218 1,907 311 2,486Total$117,055 $58,272 $5,836 $48,904 $4,043 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than the operating leases and purchase obligations noted in the preceding table. 29Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that changes will occur.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue on product sales when (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) the price is fixed or determinable, (iii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and (iv) collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured.  Revenue from our product sales not requiring installation, net of trade discounts and estimated sales allowances, is recognized when title passes, which is generally upon shipment.  We do not have any additional obligations or customer acceptance provisions after shipment of such products.  We handle returns by replacing, repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned.  Revenue from cabling infrastructure systems installations is recognized when the installation is completed, tested and accepted by the customer. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts, information about the creditworthiness of customers, and other relevant information. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period, and changes are recorded in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In addition, our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers.  A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment or automotive industry, in general, could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results, and additional allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowances are based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales, using assumptions about future product life cycles, product demand and market conditions.  If actual product life cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.  Although we believe our projected future operating results  and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.  The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge.  Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of 30operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. As of April 28, 2012, we had goodwill of $11.1 million for one business in the Interconnect segment and goodwill of $5.3 million for two businesses in the Power Products segment, for a total of $16.4 million. The fair values of reporting units exceeded their carrying values a range of approximately 50% to 200% and thus, did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.  The assumptions used in the valuation of these reporting units were made using management's best projections.  We continue to monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment.The fair value of our trademarks are estimated and compared to the carrying value.  We estimate the fair value of the intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to a projected revenues from our annual operating budgets;  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks; and a discount rate.  An impairment loss would be recognized if the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.Based on our results of our impairment test performed on one business in the Interconnect segment as of April 28, 2012, no impairment of trademarks was determined to exist.  The fair values of the trademarks tested exceeded their carrying value by approximately 100%.Income Taxes.  As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The process involves determining actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.  The tax laws of Malta provide for investment tax credits of 30% of certain qualified expenditures.  Unused credits of $24.3 million as of April 28, 2012 can be carried forward indefinitely.  We have accumulated investment tax credits in excess of amounts more likely than not to be realized based upon projections of taxable income to be generated within a reasonable time period.  Valuation allowances of $17.6 million as of April 28, 2012 have been provided for this excess. Contingencies.  We are subject to various investigations, claims, legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities.  A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. For those matters that we can estimate a range of loss, we have established reserves at levels within that range to provide for the most likely scenario based upon available information.  The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assure that the Company is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate, changes in the future could impact these determinations. Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency, primarily the U.S. dollar and the Euro.  A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our income before income taxes by $3.4 million and $3.8 million at April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, respectively.  We also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to U.S. dollars.  We generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar as long-term.  The currencies to which we are exposed are the British pound, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss Franc.  A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our net foreign investments by $21.3 million at April 28, 2012 and $17.9 million at April 30, 2011.We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  Our exposure to interest rate risk from our credit agreement, under which we had $48.0 million of net borrowings at April 28, 2012.  We estimate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal 2013 based upon our current and expected levels of our debt. 31 Table of ContentsItem 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data See Item 15 for an Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule.  Such Financial Statements and Schedule are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)).  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s applicable rules and forms.  As a result of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 28, 2012. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee.  Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst and Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.  This report is included on page F-2 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that was conducted during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by a management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 32 Table of ContentsPART III Item 10.  Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Information regarding our directors will be included under the captions “Proposal One:  Election of Directors” and “Corporate Governance” in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting to be held on September 13, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference.  Information regarding our executive officers is included under a separate caption in Part I hereof, and is incorporated herein by reference, in accordance with General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K and Instruction 3 to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.  Information regarding compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and information regarding our Audit Committee will be included under the captions “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance” and “Audit Committee Matters,” respectively, in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting and is incorporated herein by reference. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct (the “Code”) that applies to our directors, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and persons performing similar functions, as well as other employees.  The Code is publicly available on our website at www.methode.com.  If we make any substantive amendments to the Code or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. Item 11.  Executive Compensation Information regarding the above will be included under the caption “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” “Compensation Committee Report,” “Executive Compensation Tables” and “Director Compensation” in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting to be held on September 13, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters Information regarding the above will be included under the caption “Security Ownership” in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting to be held on September 13, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Information regarding the above will be included under the caption “Corporate Governance” in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting to be held on September 13, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 14.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services Information regarding the above will be included under the caption “Audit Committee Matters” in the definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting to be held on September 13, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference.33PART IV Item 15.  Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (a) The documents included in the following indexes are filed as part of this annual report on Form 10-K. (1) (2) The response to this portion of Item 15 is included in this report under the captions  “Financial Statements” and “Financial Statement Schedule” below, which is incorporated herein by reference. (3)     See “Index to Exhibits” immediately following the financial statement schedule. (b)                See “Index to Exhibits” immediately following the financial statement schedule. (c)                See “Financial Statements” and “Financial Statement Schedule.”34SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this annual report on Form 10-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.  METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. (Registrant)   By:/s/ DOUGLAS A.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries at April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended April 28, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP    Chicago, Illinois June 28, 2012 F-1REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and ShareholdersMethode Electronics, Inc. We have audited Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Methode Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended April 28, 2012 and our report dated June 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP  Chicago, Illinois June 28, 2012 F-2METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)1.  Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Methode Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company”).  As used herein, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Methode” means Methode Electronics, Inc. and its Subsidiaries. Financial Reporting Periods.  We maintain our financial records on the basis of a fifty-two or fifty-three week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30.   Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 all represent fifty-two weeks of results. Cash Equivalents.  All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are carried at their fair value and classified in the consolidated balance sheets as cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  We carry accounts receivable at their face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a regular basis, we record an allowance for uncollectible receivables based upon past transaction history with customers, customer payment practices and economic conditions. Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables. A change to the allowance for uncollectible amounts may be required if a future event or other change in circumstances results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account.  We do not require collateral for our accounts receivable balances.  Accounts are written off against the allowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible. Inventories.  Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Property, Plant and Equipment.  Properties are stated on the basis of cost.  We amortize such costs by annual charges to income, computed on the straight-line method using estimated useful lives of 5 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes.  Accelerated methods are generally used for income tax purposes.  We wrote off $39,082 of fully-depreciated gross property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2012. Income Taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Revenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue on product sales when i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, ii) the price is fixed or determinable, iii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and iv) collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured.  Revenue from our product sales not requiring installation, net of trade discounts and estimated sales allowances, is recognized when title passes, which is generally upon shipment.  Revenue from cabling infrastructure systems installations is recognized when the installation is completed, tested and accepted by the customer.  We do not have any additional obligations or customer acceptance provisions after shipment of such products.  We handle returns by replacing, repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned.  Return costs were not significant in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.   Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs.  Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales, and the related costs are included in cost of products sold. Foreign Currency Translation.  The functional currencies of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries are in their local currencies.  The results of operations of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the year, while the assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates.  Adjustments from the translation process are classified as a component of shareholders’ equity.  Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in other, net.  In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we had foreign exchange losses of $991, $2,280 and $1,151, respectively. Long-Lived Assets.  We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event that the undiscounted cash flows resulting F-8METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)from the use of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value is recorded.Goodwill and Intangibles.   Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.  Although we believe our projected future operating results  and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.  The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge.  Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions.    Research and Development Costs.  Costs associated with the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products are charged to expense when incurred.  Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended April 28, 2012, April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010 amounted to $20,360, $19,506 and $18,412, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation.  See Note 5, Shareholders’ Equity for a description of our stock-based compensation plans. Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments.  The carrying values of our short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU"), 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principals, ("GAAP") and International Financial Reporting Standards, ("IFRS"), which results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, F-9METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)which was our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter which began January 29, 2012. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income", which requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.  We adopted this pronouncement for fiscal 2012, which began on May 1, 2011.  The adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.In October 2009, the FASB, issued ASU, 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force," which amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, "Revenue Recognition", by modifying the criteria used to separate elements in a multiple-element arrangement, introducing the concept of "best estimate of selling price" for determining the selling price of a deliverable, requiring use of the relative selling price method and prohibiting use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration among units of accounting, and expanding the disclosure requirements for all multiple-element arrangements within the scope of FASB ASC 605-25.  The amended guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which is our 2012 fiscal year that began May 1, 2011.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding ASC No. 805, "Business Combinations," on thedisclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. ASC No. 805 requires a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period. The disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period.  This guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This guidance is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after May 1, 2011, the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Recently  Issued Accounting Pronouncements    In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.”  The objective of this standard is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment.  This standard permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.  The standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which will be our fiscal year 2013, that began on April 29, 2012.  The adoption of ASU 2011-08 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.2.  Restructuring During fiscal 2010, we recorded a restructuring charge of $7,770, which consisted of $4,209 for employee severance, $279 in the cancellation of lease agreements, $1,564 for accelerated depreciation for buildings and equipment and $1,718 for other costs. As of April 30, 2011, we had an accrued restructuring liability of $280 reflected in the current liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet.  This liability was paid during fiscal 2012. F-10METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.

Eetrex is located in Boulder, Colorado and is a developer and manufacturer of stationary storage chargers, inverters and battery systems for the transportation, telecommunications and computing industries.  In July 2011 and October 2011, we paid an additional $600 and $480, respectively, and acquired an additional 20% of their stock, for a total ownership interest of 90%.  Each of the other stockholders of Eetrex has the right to exercise put options, requiring us to purchase their remaining shares after the end of fiscal 2014 or 2016, and we will have an option to purchase any remaining shares after the end of fiscal 2016.  The purchase price will be based on a percentage of net sales recorded in either fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2016 of between 2.0% and 2.5%.  In accordance with ASC 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity," our non-controlling interest previously reported in equity has been reclassified to “mezzanine equity” as the ability to exercise the remaining 10% put option is now outside of our control.  The calculated redemption amount is presently below the recorded carrying value of the noncontrolling interest.  However, future adjustments to our non-controlling interest may be required which could affect earnings per share.  The accounts and transactions of Eetrex have been included in the Power Products segment in the consolidated financial statements since March 2011, the date which control was obtained.During fiscal 2012, we transferred $615 to mezzanine equity.  In addition, a net loss of $282 attributable to the noncontrolling interest was recorded, resulting in a mezzanine equity balance of $333 at April 28, 2012.On September 9, 2011, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of Nypro Monterrey, S. de R.L. (Nypro Monterrey) from Nypro Inc. for $6,353.  We operate this injection molding and painting business under the name of Advanced Molding and Decoration, S.A. de C.V. (AMD), and it has become a part of our existing Monterrey manufacturing campus.   AMD operates a state-of-the-art facility, which provides us with high-quality injection molding, painting and decorating capabilities. The AMD assets include 52 injection mold machines, three paint lines and several pad print machines.  In addition, 228 employees from Nypro Monterrey were transfered to us as part of the acquisition.F-11METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)Based on a third-party valuation report, management determined that the business had a fair value of $6,608, consisting primarily of fixed assets and inventory.  We recorded a gain of $255 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the transaction, in other income, which represents the amount paid for the assets, compared to the fair market value at the time of acquisition due to the distressed nature of the business.  The accounts and transactions of AMD have been included in the Automotive segment in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition.  The proforma impact of this acquisition as if it were made at the beginning of the earliest period presented would not have had a material impact on the historical reported results of the Company.Fiscal 2011 Acquisitions In May 2010, we paid $1,000 for an 15% equity investment in Eetrex to facilitate our entry into the electric vehicle market.  In March 2011, we paid an additional $1,070, for a total investment of $2,070, to acquire an additional 36% of the stock of Eetrex.   In April 2011, we paid an additional $650 and acquired an additional 19% of their stock, for a total 70% ownership.   In March 2011, we recognized a gain of $165 on our initial investment of $1,000, at the date control was obtained.   Based on a third-party valuation report, management determined that 100% of the net assets of Eetrex had a fair value of $6,600 as of the date that control was obtained in March 2011.  Additionally in March 2011, we also recorded $3,234 of non-controlling interest related to the transaction.  The fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired were $2,000 for the technology valuation,  and tangible net assets of $274, resulting in $4,326 of goodwill.  The technology valuation will be amortized over 10 years.  We do not expect any of the goodwill of $4,326 to be deductible for income tax purposes.Fiscal 2011 DivestituresIn March 2011, we sold our 75% ownership interest in Optokon, a manufacturer of optical cabling and test equipment, located in the Czech Republic, to the minority shareholder for $9,950.  The net assets of our 75% ownership interest had a book value of $9,859.  We recorded a gain of $4,148 related to sale of the net assets, primarily attributable to the cumulative translation gains since the date of the initial investment.  We recorded income taxes related to the sale of $3,493, resulting in a gain net of taxes of $655.  We received $5,896 in cash as well as a collateralized note for $4,054.  The note is a 15-year, interest bearing note.We concluded the Optokon results of operations for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were not material to the consolidated or segment level financial statements for those periods presented to be separately reported as a discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, "Presentation of Financial Statements".4.  Intangible Assets and Goodwill As of April 28, 2012, we had goodwill of $11,146 for one business in the Interconnect segment and goodwill of $5,276 for two businesses in the Power Products segment, for a total of $16,422. The fair values of reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 50% to 200%.  The assumptions used in the valuation of these reporting units were made using management's best projections.  We continue to monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment.The fair value of our trademarks are estimated and compared to the carrying value.  We estimate the fair value of the intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to a projected revenues from our annual operating budgets;  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks; and a discount rate.  An impairment loss would be recognized if the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.  Based on our results of our impairment test performed on one business in the Interconnect segment as of April 28, 2012, no impairment was determined to exist.  The fair values of the trademarks tested exceeded their carrying value by approximately 100%.  F-12METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.

The intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2012 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all options holders exercised their options on April 28, 2012.  Since the April 28, 2012 closing stock price was lower than the average exercise prices, the options had no intrinsic value. We estimated the fair value of these stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  2010 Stock Plan Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Awards AwardsAverage expected volatility52.76% 85.83%Average risk-free interest rate0.63% 0.60%Dividend yield2.66% 3.49%Expected life of options7.03 years 7.03 yearsWeighted-average grant-date fair value$4.27 $5.19Expected volatility was based on the monthly changes in our historical common stock prices over the expected life of the award.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant corresponding to the expected life of the options.  Our dividend yield is based on the average dividend yield for the previous two years from the date of grant.  The expected life of options is based on historical stock option exercise patterns and the terms of the options.    F-15METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units Awarded Under the 2010 Stock PlanDuring fiscal 2012, our Compensation Committee awarded 100,000 shares of common stock subject to performance-based restricted stock awards ("RSAs") to certain non-executive members of management during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  The performance measure is the Company's internal enterprise value at the end of fiscal 2015.  The internal enterprise value shall equal the product of (i) fiscal 2015 EBITDA and (ii) 7.5 (the historic multiple of EBITDA), subject to an adjustment for cash, short-term investments, debt, preferred stock, certain equity issuances, certain acquisitions and the changes in the dividend rate.  The restricted stock awards will vest, i.e., the restrictions will lapse, one-third as of the end of fiscal 2015, one-third as of the end of fiscal 2016 and the final one-third as of the end of fiscal 2017, based on the enterprise value as of the end of fiscal 2015, to the extent the performance goals have been achieved and provided the employee remains employed.  The remaining shares will be forfeited.    During fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee awarded 640,000 shares of RSAs to certain executive officers.  The performance measure will be the Company's internal enterprise value at the end of fiscal 2015.  The internal enterprise value shall equal the product of (i) fiscal 2015 EBITDA and (ii) 7.5 (the historic multiple of EBITDA), subject to an adjustment for cash, short-term investments, debt, preferred stock, certain equity issuances, certain acquisitions and the changes in the dividend rate.  The restricted stock awards will vest, i.e., the restrictions will lapse, at the end of fiscal 2015 to the extent the performance goals have been achieved.  The remaining shares will be forfeited.During fiscal 2011, our Compensation Committee awarded 320,000 shares of common stock subject to time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain executive officers.  The restricted stock units will vest 20% each year on the last day of our fiscal year and be 100% vested on the last day of fiscal 2015, provided the executive remains employed.  The  shares of common stock underlying the vested RSUs will not be delivered to the employee until after the employee terminates employment from the Company.Below are key elements related to the stock options, performance-based restricted stock awards and time-based restricted stock units issued in fiscal 2012 and 2011 under the 2010 Stock Plan:Bonus in Lieu of Dividends - For the performance-based restricted stock awards, bonuses in lieu of dividends will not be paid until the restrictions lapse (i.e., not in first 5 years).  At such time as the restrictions lapse, the executive will be paid a “dividend catch-up” bonus calculated based on the dividends declared during the restricted period and the number of shares earned.  For the time-based restricted stock units, once the restricted stock units vest and until the shares are delivered, the executive will be paid a quarterly bonus in lieu of  dividends calculated based on declared dividends and the total number of vested restricted stock units held.    Tandem Cash Award -  The executives were also granted RSA Tandem Cash Awards.  These cash incentive awards will become payable if performance under the RSAs described above exceeds target performance.  If the performance measure target for the RSAs is exceeded, the amount payable under the RSA tandem cash bonus will equal the product of the closing price of our common stock as of May 1, 2015 and the number of shares awarded to such executive officer not to exceed 40% of the awarded shares. Change of Control (Performance-based Restricted Stock Awards) - In the event of a change of control, employee shall vest in the percentage of restricted shares that, extrapolated from the Company's external enterprise value as of the date of the change of control, would have vested on the vesting date.  External enterprise value equals the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock as determined by the bona fide offer for the Company's common stock causing the change of control.Change of Control (Time-based Restricted Stock Units) - In the event of a change in control prior to the end of the 5-year period, the vesting accelerates and the restrictions on any unvested shares will lapse.Change of Control (Stock Options) - In the event of a change in control, the vesting of all outstanding option awards will be accelerated.F-16METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.

Although not recognized for financial reporting purposes, this unrecognized tax benefit is available to reduce future income and is incorporated into our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, which are discussed below.At April 28, 2012, we had valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets of $57,279.  In accordance with ASC No. 740, “Income Taxes”, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In fiscal 2010, we utilized all ability to carry-back federal U.S. losses to prior years.  Future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law.  Sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences, taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies.  These sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. In forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets, we considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our recent cumulative loss.  We F-22METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)will continue to assess this situation and make appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance based on our evaluation of the positive and negative evidence existing at the time.  We are currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for us to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that we have recorded.The federal and state NOL carry forwards relate to the current and prior years’ NOLs, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future years.  If not realized, the federal tax benefits of $20,989 expire over a twenty year period.  If not realized, the state tax benefits of $3,532 expire over a twelve to twenty year period. The foreign tax credit carry-forward relates to the current year, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future years.  If not realized, the federal tax benefits of $1,393 expire over a ten-year period. The tax laws of Malta provide for investment tax credits of 30% of certain qualified expenditures.  Unused credits of $24.4 million as of April 28, 2012 can be carried forward indefinitely.  We have accumulated investment tax credits in excess of amounts more likely than not to be realized based upon projections of taxable income to be generated within a reasonable time period.  Valuation allowances of $17.6 million as of April 28, 2012 have been provided for this excess.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded $9,012 of deferred U.S. tax, net of associated foreign tax credits, to recognize deferred tax on undistributed foreign earnings of $38,000 that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations.  We offset this deferred tax expense by reducing our valuation allowance by an equal amount of $9,012.Components of income/(loss) before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 May 1, 2010Domestic source$(32,418) $(20,658) $(20,018)Foreign source43,791 35,120 27,835Income/(loss) before income tax$11,373 $14,462 $7,817Income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:  Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 May 1, 2010Current     Federal$36 $(2,703) $(11,356)Foreign5,672 4,179 1,339State(533) (345) 61Subtotal5,175 1,131 (9,956)      Deferred     Federal and state119 (3,198) 4,827Foreign(2,058) (2,009) (835)Subtotal(1,939) (5,207) 3,992Total income tax/(benefit)$3,236 $(4,076) $(5,964) F-23METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.

We record investment tax credits using the "flow through" method.Income tax provision (benefit) allocated to continuing operations and discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended: Fiscal Year 2012 2011 2010Continuing operations$3,236 $(4,076) $(5,964)Discontinued operations— 3,493 —Total tax provision$3,236 $(583) $(5,964) As of April 28, 2012, our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $66.  After considering the federal impact on the state issues, $66 of this total would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in our favor. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: Balance at April 30, 2011$375Increases for positions related to the current year—Decreases for positions related to the prior years(272)Lapsing of statutes of limitations(37)Balance at April 28, 2012$66 F-24METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months.  We have certain tax return years subject to statutes of limitation, which will close within twelve months from the end of the fiscal 2012.  Unless challenged by tax authorities, the closure of those statutes of limitation is expected to result in the recognition of uncertain tax positions of $36. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for fiscal year ended May 2, 2009.  Generally, the fiscal years ended May 2, 2009 and forward remain open under the state statute of limitations. The continuing practice of the Company is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the provision for income taxes.  We had $59 accrued for interest and no accrual for penalties at April 28, 2012.  We recorded an interest expense reversal related to unrecognized tax provision of $265 in fiscal 2012 and no expense for penalties. 8.  Earnings Per Share Attributable to Methode Shareholders Basic earnings per share attributable to Methode shareholders ("basic earnings per share") is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period.  Diluted income per share attributable to Methode shareholders ("diluted earnings per share") is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic income per share calculation for the effect of all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:  Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2012 April 30, 2011 May 1, 2010Numerator:     Income from continuing operations, net of tax$8,383 $18,845 $13,655Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— 655 —Net income attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc.$8,383 $19,500 $13,655      Denominator:     Denominator for basic earnings  per share-weighted average shares37,366,505 37,128,157 36,711,925Dilutive potential common shares-employee and director stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units225,475 710,511 219,679Denominator for diluted earnings  per share adjusted weighted average shares and assumed conversions37,591,980 37,838,668 36,931,604      Basic income per share:     Continuing operations$0.22 $0.51 $0.37Discontinued operations$— $0.02 $—Basic income per share$0.22 $0.53 $0.37      Diluted income per share:     Continuing operations$0.22 $0.50 $0.37Discontinued operations$— $0.02 $—Diluted income per share$0.22 $0.52 $0.37 Options to purchase 834,412, 135,990 and 369,651 shares of common stock were outstanding at April 28, 2012, April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares; therefore, the effect would have been anti-dilutive. F-25METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)9.  Environmental Matters We are not aware of any potential unasserted environmental claims that may be brought against us.  We are involved in environmental investigation and/or remediation at two of our plant sites no longer used for operations.  We use environmental consultants to assist us in evaluating our environmental liabilities in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.  Accruals are recorded when environmental remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations and the advancement of remediation technology.  Considering these factors, we have estimated (without discounting) the costs of remediation, which will be incurred over a period of several years.  Recovery from insurance or other third parties is not anticipated.  We are not yet able to determine when such remediation activity will be complete, but estimates for certain remediation efforts are projected through fiscal 2015. At April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, we had accruals, primarily based upon independent engineering studies, for environmental matters of $2,881 and $4,669, respectively, of which $500 was classified in other accrued expenses and the remainder was included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.  We believe the provisions made for environmental matters are adequate to satisfy liabilities relating to such matters, however it is reasonably possible that costs could exceed accrued amounts if the selected methods of remediation do not reduce the contaminates at the sites to levels acceptable to federal and state regulatory agencies. In fiscal 2012, we spent $1,501 on remediation cleanups and related studies compared with $527 in fiscal 2011 and $474 in fiscal 2010.  The costs associated with environmental matters as they relate to day-to-day activities were not material in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.10.  Pending Litigation Certain litigation arising in the normal course of business is pending against us.  We, from time to time, are subject to various legal actions and claims incidental to our business, including those arising out of alleged defects, breach of contracts, employment-related matters and environmental matters.  We consider insurance coverage and third party indemnification when determining required accruals for pending litigation and claims.  Although the outcome of potential legal actions and claims cannot be determined, it is the opinion of our management, based on the information available, that we have adequate reserves for these liabilities and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.Delphi Related LitigationOn September 4, 2008, Methode and Delphi Automotive Systems LLC (“Delphi”) entered into a supply agreement pursuant to which Methode was to supply all of Delphi’s requirements for the seat bladders used in Delphi’s occupant restraint system from October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2011. On August 26, 2009, Delphi notified us that effective September 10, 2009, our supply arrangement was terminated. We are contesting Delphi’s right to terminate this long-term supply arrangement and the parties are engaged in litigation regarding this supply agreement and our related intellectual property.In March 2010, DPH Holdings Corp. and certain of its affiliated debtors, as successors to Delphi Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“Delphi”), served the Company with a complaint seeking to recover approximately $19.7 million in alleged preference payments that Delphi made to the Company within the 90-day period preceding Delphi’s bankruptcy filing in October 2005 (the “Complaint”).  Delphi is pursuing similar preference complaints against a number of other, unrelated third-parties.  The Complaint, dated September 28, 2007, was originally filed under seal with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (titled as Delphi Corporation, et al. v. Methode Electronics, Inc, Adversary Proceeding No. 07-2432) and pursuant to certain court orders, the Complaint was not unsealed and served upon the Company until March 2010.  The Company has filed a joinder to third-parties’ motions to dismiss the Delphi preference complaints based on violations of due process and other defenses connected to the unusual manner that Delphi filed and served the preference complaints.   Additionally, the Company possesses several other substantive defenses to the Complaint including, but not limited to, the affirmative defenses available under the Bankruptcy Code, statute of limitations, setoff, waiver F-26METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)and estoppel.  The Bankruptcy Court ruled on July 22, 2010 that the Complaint did not satisfy certain pleading requirements and dismissed the Complaint without prejudice, granting Delphi leave to re-file an amended complaint.  The Court overruled the Company's defenses to the proposed amended complaint relating primarily to pleading issues, and ordered that other defenses would be addressed in subsequent proceedings.  Although the outcome of potential legal actions and claims cannot be determined, it is the opinion of our management, based on the information available, that we have adequate reserves for these liabilities and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 11.  Material Customers Sales to two customers in the Automotive segment, either directly or through their tiered suppliers, represented a significant portion of our business.  Net sales to these two customers approximated 18.7% and 18.5% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012; two customers accounted for 17.9% and 17.6% of consolidated net sales, respectively in fiscal 2011 and two customers accounted for 18.2% and 13.9% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2010. At April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, accounts receivable from customers in the automotive industry were approximately $31,850 and $44,428, respectively, which included $8,260 and $8,077, respectively, at our Maltese subsidiary.  Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 to 60 days.  Credit losses relating to all customers generally have been within management’s expectation. 12.  Line of Credit We are party to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions, which reflects the maturity of February 25, 2016.  The credit facility is in the aggregate principal amount of $75,000, with an option to increase the principal amount by an additional $25,000 subject to customary conditions and approval of the lender(s) providing new commitment(s).  The credit facility provides for variable rates of interest based on the type of borrowing and the Company's debt to EBITDA financial ratio.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  The interest rate on the credit agreement is 1.5% plus LIBOR.  At April 28, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants of the agreement.  During fiscal 2012, we had borrowings of $52,000 and payments of $4,700, which includes $700 of interest under this credit facility.   As of April 28, 2012, there were outstanding balances against the credit facility of $48,000.   There was $27,000 available to borrow under the credit agreement as of April 28, 2012, which does not include the option to increase the principal amount.  We believe the fair value approximates the carrying amount as of April 28, 2012.F-27METHODE ELECTRONICS, INC.
