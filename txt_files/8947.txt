Forward Looking Statements  Certain statements herein about our expectations of future events or results constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as, may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates,
predicts, potential, continue, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and
managements views and assumptions regarding future events. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, changes in customer demand and response to products and services offered by AZZ, including demand by the
electrical power generation markets, electrical transmission and distribution markets, the industrial markets, and the hot dip galvanizing markets; prices and raw material cost, including zinc and natural gas which are used in the hot dip
galvanizing process; changes in the economic conditions of the various markets that AZZ serves, foreign and domestic, customer request delays of shipments, acquisition opportunities, currency exchange rates, adequacy of financing, and availability
of experienced management employees to implement AZZs growth strategy; a downturn in market conditions in any industry relating to the products we inventory or sell or the services that we provide; the continuing economic volatility in the
U.S. and other markets in which we operate; and acts of war or terrorism inside the United States or abroad. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. These statements are based on information as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and AZZ assumes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  
PART I  Item 1.    Business 
AZZ incorporated (AZZ, the Company or we) was established in 1956 and incorporated under the laws of
the State of Texas. We are an electrical equipment and components manufacturer, serving the global markets of power generation, transmission and distribution, and the general industrial markets, and a leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services
to the steel fabrication market nationwide and in Canada. We offer products through two distinct business segments, the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and the Galvanizing Services Segment. 
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment  Our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered specialty electrical products and industrial lighting and tubular products, all of which we market and sell both in domestic and
international markets. Our electrical products are designed, manufactured and configured to distribute electrical power to and from generators, transformers, switching devices and other electrical configurations and are supplied to the power
generation, transmission and distribution markets and also to the general industrial market. Our industrial products include industrial lighting and tubular products. We provide lighting products to the petroleum and food processing industries, and
to other industries with unique lighting challenges. We also provide tubular products to the petroleum industry.  The markets
for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment are highly competitive and consist of a few large multi-national companies, along with numerous small independent companies. Competition is based primarily on product quality, range of product line,
price and service. While some of our competitors are much larger and better financed than us, we believe that we can compete favorably with them. 
  2 


Table of Contents
Copper, aluminum and steel are the primary raw materials used by this segment. All of these
raw materials are currently readily available. Because the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment does not commit contractually to minimum volumes, increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the
customers contracts, although during difficult market conditions the customer may resist these escalation clauses. In addition, we look to get firm pricing contracts from our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers
to minimize risk.  We sell this segments products through manufacturers representatives, distributors, agents and
our internal sales force. We are not dependent on any single customer for this segment, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income. 
Backlog of orders for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment was approximately $138.6 million at February 29, 2012, $108.4
million at February 28, 2011 and $109.9 million at February 28, 2010. The majority of the backlog as of February 29, 2012 should be delivered during the next 18 months. We believe that the contracts and purchase orders included in the
backlog are firm.  During the Companys fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, the Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment had international sales of $43.7 million, or 23% of this segments total revenues of $189.2 million. During the fiscal years ended February 28, 2011 and February 28, 2010, the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment had
international sales of $27.9 million and $43.6 million, respectively, and international sales comprised approximately 17% and 21%, respectively, of this segments total revenues. 
We employed a total of 712 people in this segment as of February 29, 2012.  Galvanizing Services Segment  The Galvanizing Services Segment provides
hot dip galvanizing to the steel fabrication industry through facilities located throughout the South, Midwest, East Coast and Southwest of the United States and in Quebec, Canada. Hot dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process in which molten zinc
is applied to a customers material. The zinc bonding renders corrosion protection to fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. As of February 29, 2012, we operated thirty-four galvanizing plants, which are located in
Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi , Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia in the United States and Montreal, Canada. 
Galvanizing is a highly competitive business, and we compete with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by
manufacturers, and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint. Our galvanizing markets are generally limited to areas within relatively close proximity to our galvanizing plants due to freight cost. 
Zinc, the principal raw material used in the galvanizing process, is currently readily available, but has volatile pricing. We manage our
exposure to commodity pricing of zinc by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps and fixed costs contracts to guard against escalating commodity prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with
individual utilities when possible.  We typically serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide services to the electrical
and telecommunications, bridge and highway, petrochemical and general industrial markets, and numerous original equipment manufacturers. We do not depend on any single customer for our galvanizing services, and the loss of any single customer would
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income.  The backlog of galvanizing orders generally is
nominal due to the short time requirement involved in the process.  Effective February 1, 2012, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of AZZ acquired substantially all of the assets of Galvan Metal, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Canada, including a galvanizing plant located in 
  3 


Table of Contents

Montreal, Quebec and related equipment and supplies. The purchase price for this transaction was $29.1 million ($27.4 million net of cash acquired on hand at Galvan Metal, Inc. of $1.7 million).
This acquisition was made to expand our galvanizing services geographic footprint internationally.  On August 3, 2010, we
completed our acquisition of North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. (NGA), a leading provider of corrosion protection for iron and steel components fabricated by its customers. AZZ gained control of NGA on June 14,
2010 by acquiring approximately 83% of its outstanding capital stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis) through a cash tender offer and caused NGA to be merged with and into an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AZZ created solely for such
acquisition, with NGA as the surviving entity. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger among AZZ, such subsidiary of AZZ and NGA, upon the completion of this merger each share of the remaining 17% of NGAs outstanding capital
stock (i.e., the shares not held by AZZ) was converted into the right to receive the same per-share cash consideration paid in such tender offer. This merger resulted in NGA being a wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ. The acquisition was made to expand
our geographic footprint.  During the Companys fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, the Galvanizing Services
Segment had international sales of $.6 million of this segments total revenues of $279.9 million. During the fiscal years ended February 28, 2011 and February 28, 2010, the Galvanizing Services Segment had no international
sales.  We employed a total of 1,442 people in this segment as of February 29, 2012. 
The information regarding revenues, profits or losses and total assets for each of the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and the
Galvanizing Services Segment included in the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.  In order to maintain permits to operate certain of our facilities, we may need to make future capital expenditures for equipment in order to meet new or existing environmental regulations.

 Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and
uncertainties facing our business. However, they are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our future growth could be impacted as well. 
Our business segments operate in highly competitive markets.  Many of our competitors, primarily in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources. Competition is based on a number of factors, including
price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower pricing than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the
expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer
base at current levels or increase our customer base.  Global warming could impact our business. 
Global warming could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this
time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage related to natural disasters at the Companys sites.
 International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure
required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction and market conditions. 
The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered,
the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and
availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services. 
  6 


Table of Contents
Our business segments are sensitive to economic downturns. 
If the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a
reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting revenues and
results from operations. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and
pay for past services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers demand for our
products. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could continue to impact our customers and
could in turn severely impact the demand for spending projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.  International and political events may
adversely affect our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments.  A portion of the revenues
from our Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Services Segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition:   


 

 
 political and economic instability, such as is occurring in Northern Africa, Europe and the Middle East; 


 

 
 social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; 


 

 
 inflation; 


 

 
 currency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions; 


 

 
 governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and 


 

 
 trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries. 
Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our
operations.  We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to
manufacture our products, including steel, aluminum and copper. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. In our Galvanizing Services Segment, zinc and
natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are highly volatile. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments:
supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but
may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers.  Our volume of fixed-price contracts
for our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment could adversely affect our business.  We currently generate, and
expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may
vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.

Table of Contents
Our compliance with various governmental regulations and environmental risks may
increase our costs and potentially lower demand for our products.  In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the U.S. government has implemented new safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has imposed additional requirements with respect to development and
production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas. In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it intends to require that operators demonstrate
their compliance with new regulations before they resume deepwater drilling. While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved during 2011, we cannot predict when the pace at which operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will be
able to satisfy these requirements and return to previous levels of active drilling. Further, we cannot predict what the continuing effects from the U.S. government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas
exploration and development activity, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities
and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.  In addition, our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and
regulations may:   


 

 
 require the acquisition of a permit before operations can be commenced; 
 


 

 
 restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment; 
 


 

 
 require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations; and 
 


 

 
 impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. 
The recent trend toward stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulation is likely to continue. The enactment of stricter
legislation or the adoption of stricter regulations could have a significant impact on our operating costs.  Our acquisition strategy
involves a number of risks.  We intend to pursue growth through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire companies or
assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on
potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:   


 

 
 difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; 


 

 
 the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company; 


 

 
 a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business; 


 

 
 additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;



 

 
 risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during our due diligence; 


 

 
 a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and



 

 
 a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.

Table of Contents
Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may
not be available on attractive terms.  Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting in the Electrical and Industrial
Products Segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.  As discussed in
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized on
the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings
or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of
contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such
adjustments could be significant.  We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.  We have a backlog of work in our Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments
received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value
associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual
right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled. 
Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. 
Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by: 
 


 

 
 the timing and volume of work under new agreements; 


 

 
 general economic conditions; 


 

 
 inclement weather, such as that which affected much of the continental United States during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2011;



 

 
 the budgetary spending patterns of customers; 


 

 
 variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter; 


 

 
 losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; 


 

 
 a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions; 


 

 
 a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business; 


 

 
 a change in customer delivery schedule; 


 

 
 increases in design and manufacturing costs; and 


 

 
 abilities of customers to pay their invoices owed to us.  Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.

We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth. 
Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: 
 


 

 
 attract new customers, internationally and domestically; 


 

 
 potential regulatory changes; 


 

 
 increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers; 


 

 
 hire and retain employees; and 


 

 
 increase volume utilizing our existing facilities.  Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash
flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.  The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.  We
depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and
retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.  Our business requires skilled labor, and we may
be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.  Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will
be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force
necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain
our business or grow our revenues.  Actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our
profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.  In the future, the Company could be named as a
defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or with respect to the equipment we manufacture. We
could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against
certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, our
consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation and possibly divert management resources away from operating our business.
 Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete. 
All of the products manufactured and sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The
competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products or production methods, which will make current products
or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence.

Catastrophic events could disrupt our business. 
The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis or hurricanes to epidemics such as
health epidemics to acts of war and terrorism could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects and could potentially expose the Company to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance
policies or may be subject to deductibles. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders or raw materials used in normal business operations. These
situations are outside the Companys control and could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.  We may
incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.  In March 2010, Congress passed,
and the President signed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation could cause
us to incur additional healthcare and other costs, but we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation and are currently assessing the extent of any long-term impact. 
Adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union
representation and our business could be adversely impacted.  Other than an immaterial number of employees at three of
our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or our entire workforce
were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations,
the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.

Item 3.
Legal Proceedings 
Environmental Proceedings  We are subject to various environmental protection reviews by state and federal government agencies. We cannot presently determine the ultimate liability, if any, that might result from these reviews or
additional clean-up and remediation expenses. However, as a result of an internal analysis and prior clean-up efforts, we believe that the reviews and any required remediation will not have a material impact on the Company. In order to maintain
permits to operate certain of our facilities, we may need to make future capital expenditures for equipment in order to meet new or existing environmental regulations.

 The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board and is dependent on our earnings, capital
requirements, operating and financial condition and other factors. We have paid dividends quarterly during each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. The total amount paid for dividends during fiscal 2012 was $12.6 million, compared to $12.5 million
during fiscal 2011. We have a debt covenant with our lenders that restricts the amount of annual dividends to not exceed $15 million.  In January of 2012, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, and the amount and
prices paid for any future share purchases under the new authorization will be based on market conditions and other factors at the time of the purchase. Repurchases under this share repurchase authorization will be made through open market purchases
or private transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We did not repurchase any shares of Common Stock during the fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2012. 
The approximate number of holders of record of our Common Stock at May 16, 2012 was 501. See Item 12 of this Report for
information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.

Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 
You should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under
Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview 
We operate two distinct business segments, the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and the Galvanizing Services Segment. The
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment serves the power generation, transmission and distribution markets and the general industrial market. As of February 29, 2012, the Galvanizing Services Segment consists of thirty-three hot
dip-galvanizing facilities located throughout the South, Midwest, East Coast and Southwest United States, as well as one location in Montreal, Canada, that provide galvanizing services to the steel fabrication industry. References herein to fiscal
years are to the twelve-month periods that end in February of the relevant calendar year. For example, the twelve-month period ended February 29, 2012 is referred to as fiscal 2012 or fiscal year 2012. 
For the fiscal year-ended February 29, 2012, we recorded revenues of $469.1 million compared to the prior years revenues of
$380.6 million. Approximately 40% of our revenues were generated from the Electrical and 
  16 


Table of Contents

Industrial Products Segment and approximately 60% were generated from the Galvanizing Services Segment. Net income for fiscal 2012 was $40.7 million compared to $35.0 million for fiscal 2011. Net
income as a percentage of sales was 8.7% for fiscal 2012 as compared to 9.2% for fiscal 2011. Earnings per share increased by 16% to $3.21 per share for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.77 per share for fiscal 2011, on a diluted basis. 
For fiscal 2012, our incoming order rate reflected what we believe to be a positive trend in our business cycle, and we are beginning to
see modest increases in our inquiry and quotation levels for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and modest growth in our Galvanizing Services Segment. Our book to ship ratio for fiscal 2012 was 106% which is encouraging considering the
weak growth in the economy. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the book to ship ratio of 105% further indicates modest growth considering our fourth quarter is traditionally our weakest quarter for incoming orders. While the opportunities are
increasing, pricing remains a challenge due to competitive forces and increased cost of commodities. On February 1, 2012, we acquired Galvan Metal, Inc., a galvanizing facility in Montreal, QC Canada. We believe that this acquisition will aid
us by increasing our international geographic galvanizing footprint.  Results of Operations 
Management believes that analyzing our revenue and operating income by segment is the most meaningful way to analyze our results of
operations. Segment operating income consists of net sales less cost of sales, identifiable selling, general and administrative expenses, and other (income) expense items that are specifically identifiable to a segment. The other (income) expense
items included in segment operating income are generally insignificant. For a reconciliation of segment operating income to pretax income, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Year ended February 29, 2012 compared with year ended February 28, 2011  Backlog  We ended fiscal 2012 with a backlog of $138.6 million, an
increase of 28% as compared to fiscal 2011 ending backlog of $108.4 million. All ending backlog for fiscal 2012 relates to our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. Our book-to-ship ratio was 1.06 to 1 for fiscal 2012 as compared to 1.0 to 1
in the prior year. Incoming orders increased 32% for fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period last year. In fiscal 2012, our backlog had favorable growth as a result of improved order intake in our served markets, with the power generation market
showing the most significant improvement as compared to fiscal 2011. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 marked the fifth consecutive quarter with a book to ship ratio in excess of one to one.  The following table reflects bookings and shipments for fiscal 2012 and 2011.

 The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered specialty products supplied to
the power generation, power transmission, power distribution and general industrial markets and lighting and tubular products to the industrial and petroleum markets. The segment recorded revenues for fiscal 2012 of $189.2 million, an increase of
16% compared to fiscal 2011 revenues of $162.6 million. The increased revenues for fiscal 2012 resulted from higher demand from primarily the power generation market as compared to the same period last year. In addition, we completed some quick turn
jobs in this segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.  Our Galvanizing Services Segment, which consisted of thirty-four
hot dip galvanizing facilities as of February 29, 2012, generated revenues of $279.9 million, a 28% increase from the prior years revenues of $218.0 million. Volume of steel processed for the fiscal year increased 27% and selling price
increased 1% for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The acquisition of NGA generated $83.0 million of this segments revenue for fiscal 2012, as compared to $49.7 million in fiscal 2011. The $49.7 million in revenues for fiscal 2011
reflects revenues earned from nine months of operations from the acquisition date of June 14, 2010 through the end of fiscal 2011. The acquisition of NGA accounted for 58% of the increase in the total segments volume. Excluding the
acquisition of NGA, volumes increased 15% and selling price increased 2% for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The improved volumes reflect the improvement in the overall industrial sector of the general economy as well as increased revenues
from electrical utility customers. Historically, revenues for this segment have followed closely the condition of the industrial sector of the general economy.  Segment Operating Income  The following table reflects the

 Total segment operating income (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) increased $14.7
million to $98.7 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to $84.0 million in fiscal 2011. Consolidated operating margins as a percentage of sales decreased to 21% for fiscal 2012 as compared to 22% in fiscal 2011. The Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment generated 26% of the operating income for fiscal 2012, while the Galvanizing Services Segment produced the remaining 74%.  Operating income for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment decreased $1.3 million, or 5%, for fiscal 2012, to $25.8 million as compared to $27.1 million for fiscal 2011. Operating margins for
this segment were 14% for fiscal 2012 as compared to 17% for fiscal 2011. Operating margins were negatively impacted from less favorable pricing due to more competitive market conditions for the compared periods. Margins are expected to improve in
fiscal 2013, but we do not expect them to return to fiscal 2011 levels.

Table of Contents
Operating income for the Galvanizing Service Segment increased $16.0 million, or 28%, for
fiscal 2012 to $73.0 million as compared to $57.0 million for the prior year. Operating margins were 26% for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Operating margin improvements from operating efficiencies and increased plant utilization were offset by
increased zinc costs for the compared periods.  General Corporate Expense 
General corporate expenses were $21.6 million for fiscal 2012 and $21.5 million for fiscal 2011. As a percentage of sales, general
corporate expenses were 4.6% for fiscal 2012 as compared to 5.6% in fiscal 2011. The percentage of sales to general corporate expenses was higher in fiscal 2011 due to the expenses of $1.9 million in acquisition costs related to the NGA acquisition.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, acquisition expenses of $.5 million were incurred in connection with the Galvan Metal, Inc. asset acquisition.  Interest  Interest expense for fiscal 2012 increased 80% to $13.9
million as compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to the interest payments arising from the $125 million unsecured notes that were issued on January 21, 2011. We had outstanding long term debt of $225 million
at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to $225 million at the end of fiscal 2011. Our long-term debt as a percentage of shareholders equity ratio was .78 to 1 at the end of fiscal 2012.  Other (Income) Expense  For fiscal 2012 and 2011, the amounts in
other (income) expense (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were insignificant.  Provision For Income Taxes
 The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 36% for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. As a result of
the Galvan Metal, Inc. asset acquisition on February 1, 2012, we were able to decrease a valuation allowance for a Canadian net operating loss carry forward during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Year ended February 28, 2011 compared with year ended February 28, 2010  Backlog  We ended fiscal 2011 with a backlog of $108.4 million, a
decrease of 1% as compared to fiscal 2010 ending backlog of $109.9 million. All ending backlog for fiscal 2011 relates to our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. Our book-to-ship ratio was 1.0 to 1 for fiscal 2011 as compared to .82 to 1 in
the prior year. In fiscal 2011, our back log did stabilize but we did not see the recovery that we had anticipated. Incoming orders increased 30% for fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period last year. The incoming orders reflected a continued
slower release despite the year over year increase of orders, due to economic and regulatory uncertainty.  The following table reflects
bookings and shipments for fiscal 2011 and 2010.  Backlog Table

 The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered specialty products supplied to
the power generation, power transmission, power distribution and general industrial markets and lighting and tubular products to the industrial and petroleum markets. The segment recorded revenues for fiscal 2011 of $162.6 million, a decrease of 20%
compared to fiscal 2010 revenues of $203.5 million. The lower revenues reflected reduced demand from the petrochemical and electrical transmission and distribution markets as compared to the same period in fiscal 2010. 
Our Galvanizing Services Segment, which consisted of thirty-three hot dip galvanizing facilities as of February 28, 2011, generated
revenues of $218.0 million, a 42% increase from the prior years revenues of $153.6 million. Volume of steel processed for the fiscal year increased 40% and selling price increased 2% for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. As discussed
previously, we acquired NGA on June 14, 2010. Excluding the acquisition of NGA, volumes increased 6% and selling price increased 3%. The improved volumes reflected the overall improvement of the industrial sector of the general economy.
Historically, revenues for this segment have followed closely the condition of the industrial sector of the general economy.  Segment

million to $84.0 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $85.6 million in fiscal 2010. Consolidated operating margins as a percentage of sales decreased to 22% for fiscal 2011 as compared to 24% in fiscal 2010. The Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment generated 32% of the operating income for fiscal 2011, while the Galvanizing Services Segment produced the remaining 68%.  Operating income for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment decreased $13.7 million, or 34%, for fiscal 2011, to $27.1 million as compared to $40.8 million for fiscal 2010. Operating margins for
this segment were 17% for fiscal 2011 as compared to 20% for fiscal 2010. Operating margins were unfavorable for fiscal 2011 due to the loss of leverage and operational efficiencies which resulted in reduced plant utilization combined with less
favorable pricing caused by competitive market conditions for the compared periods.

Table of Contents
Operating income for the Galvanizing Service Segment increased $12.1 million for fiscal 2011
to $57.0 million as compared to $44.8 million for the prior year. Operating margins were 26% for fiscal 2011 and 29% for fiscal 2010. Margins were adversely impacted by higher zinc costs for fiscal 2011 and 2010. The operating income and margins for
NGA were $12.2 million and 25%, respectively, for fiscal 2011.  General Corporate Expense 
General corporate expenses were $21.5 million for fiscal 2011 and $18.4 million for fiscal 2010. As a percentage of sales, general
corporate expenses were 5.6% for fiscal 2011 as compared to 5.2% in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we expensed $1.9 million in acquisition costs related to the NGA acquisition.  Interest  Interest expense for fiscal 2011 increased 13.1% to $7.7
million as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to the short term borrowing against our revolving line of credit to partially fund the acquisition of NGA. In addition, additional interest was incurred on our $125 million
unsecured notes that were issued as of January 21, 2011. We had outstanding long term debt of $225 million at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to $100 million at the end of fiscal 2010; the additional long term debt outstanding at the end of
fiscal 2011 resulted entirely from the 2011 Note Offering (as described under Liquidity and Capital Resources). Our long-term debt as a percentage of shareholders equity ratio was .88 to 1 at the end of fiscal 2011. 
Other (Income) Expense  For fiscal 2011 and 2010, the amounts in other (income) expense (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were insignificant.  Provision For Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes reflects
an effective tax rate of 36% for fiscal 2011 and 38% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to higher benefits under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code, domestic production deduction, resulting from differences in
the mix of profits for the compared periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities along with bank and long term
borrowings. Our cash requirements are generally for operating activities, cash dividend payments, capital improvements, debt repayment, letter of credits and acquisitions. We believe that working capital, funds available under our credit agreement,
and funds generated from operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities, dividends, capital improvements, and payment of debt and possible future acquisitions during fiscal 2013. 
Our operating activities generated cash flows of approximately $64.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012 and $42.1
million in the prior fiscal year. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012 included net income in the amount of $40.7 million, depreciation and amortization in the amount of $22.6 million, and other adjustments to
reconcile net income to net cash in the amount of $6.3 million. Included in other adjustments were provisions for bad debt in the amount of $.4 million, deferred income taxes in the amount of $2.5 million, gain or loss on the sale of assets in the
amount of $.2 million, and non-cash adjustments in the amount of $3.2 million. Negative cash flow was recognized due to increased receivables and prepaids in the amount of $11.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Positive cash flow was
recognized due to decreased inventories and revenue in excess of billings in the amount of $.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and increased accounts payables and other accrued liabilities in the amount of $2.4 million and $1.7 million,
respectively. Accounts receivable average days outstanding were 48 days for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, as compared to 47 days for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011.

Table of Contents
Our working capital was $224.8 million at February 29, 2012, as compared to $225.8
million at February 28, 2011.  During fiscal 2012, capital improvements were made in the amount of $19.8 million. The
breakdown of capital spending by segment for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We received sales or insurance proceeds for property and equipment in the amount of $.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and related tax benefits in
the amount of $.2 million. There was a quarterly cash dividend paid throughout fiscal 2012 totaling $12.6 million.  On
May 25, 2006, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) by and between AZZ and Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America). As subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement provides
for an $80 million unsecured revolving line of credit with one lender, Bank of America, maturing on May 25, 2014. The Credit Agreement allows for the payment of cash dividends in an aggregate amount of up to $15 million annually and the
repurchase of up to $50 million of AZZ Common Stock over the life of the Credit Agreement. The facility is used to provide for working capital needs, capital improvements, future acquisitions and letter of credit needs. 
The Credit Agreement provides for various financial covenants consisting of a) Minimum Consolidated Net Worth  maintain on a
consolidated basis net worth equal to at least the sum of $182.3 million, plus 50% of future net income, b) Maximum Leverage Ratio  maintain on a consolidated basis a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.25:1.0,
c) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  maintain on a consolidated basis a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least 1.75:1.0 and d) Capital Expenditures  not to make Capital Expenditures (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) on a consolidated basis in an amount in excess of $30 million.  The Credit Agreement also provides for an
applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% over the Eurodollar Rate and Commitment Fees ranging from .20% to .30% depending on our Leverage Ratio.  At February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, we had no outstanding debt against the revolving credit facility. Also, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $16.4 million as of
February 29, 2012, which left approximately $63.6 million of additional credit available under the revolving credit facility.  On March 31, 2008, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which the Company issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of its
6.24% unsecured Senior Notes (the 2008 Notes) due March 31, 2018 through a private placement (the 2008 Note Offering). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Companys payment obligations with respect to the
Notes may be accelerated upon any Event of Default, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement.  The Company entered into an
additional Note Purchase Agreement on January 21, 2011 (the 2011 Agreement), pursuant to which the Company issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.42% unsecured Senior Notes (the 2011 Notes), due in
January of 2021, through a private placement (the 2011 Note Offering). Pursuant to the 2011 Agreement, the Companys payment obligations with respect to the 2011 Notes may be accelerated under certain circumstances. The Company
anticipates using the proceeds from the 2011 Note Offering for possible future acquisitions, working capital needs, capital improvements and future cash dividend payments.  In connection with the 2008 Note Offering, the Company entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement. The Amendment contained the consent of Bank of America to the 2008 Note Offering, amended the
Credit Agreement to provide that the 2008 Note Offering will not constitute a default under the Credit Agreement and amended the Credit Agreement to reflect the same financial covenants as the 2008 Notes. In connection with the

  22 


Table of Contents

2011 Note Offering, the Company obtained the consent of Bank of America to the 2011 Note Offering and the agreement of Bank of America that the 2011 Note Offering will not constitute a default
under the Credit Agreement.  The 2008 Notes and the 2011 Notes each provide for various financial covenants of a) Minimum
Consolidated Net Worth - Maintain on a consolidated basis net worth equal to at least the sum of $116.9 million plus 50% of future net income; b) Maximum Ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA  Maintain a ratio of
indebtedness to EBITDA (as defined in Note Purchase Agreement) not to exceed 3.25:1.00; c) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  Maintain on a consolidated basis a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of at least
2.0:1.0; d) Priority Indebtedness  The Company will not at any time permit aggregate amount of all Priority Indebtedness (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Note Purchase
Agreement).  We were in compliance at February 29, 2012 with all of our debt covenants. 
Our current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) was 3.88 to 1 at the end of fiscal 2012, as compared to 4.88 to 1 at the end of
fiscal 2011. Shareholder equity grew 12.3% during fiscal 2012 to $287.6 million. At the end of fiscal 2012, we had $225 million in long-term debt outstanding and our long-term debt as a percentage to shareholders equity ratio was .78 to 1.
 Historically, we have not experienced a significant impact on our operations from increases in general inflation other than
for specific commodities. We have exposure to commodity price increases in both segments of our business, primarily copper, aluminum and steel in the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, and zinc and natural gas in the Galvanizing Services
Segment. We attempt to minimize these increases through escalation clauses in customer contracts for copper, aluminum and steel, when market conditions allow and through protective caps and fixed contract purchases on zinc. In addition to these
measures, we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing process and through increases in prices where competitively feasible. Many economists predict increased inflation in coming years due to U.S. and
international monetary policies, and there is no assurance that inflation will not impact our business in the future.  Off Balance Sheet
Transactions and Related Matters  There are no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including
contingent obligations) or other relationships of the Company with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  Contractual Commitments

Commodity pricing  The Company manages its exposures to commodity prices through the use of the following:  In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper, aluminum and steel. Because the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment does not commit
contractually to minimum volumes, increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in customer contracts, although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be obtainable. In addition, we
look to get firm pricing contracts from our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers to minimize risk.  In the Galvanizing Services Segment, we utilize contracts with our zinc suppliers that include protective caps and fixed cost contracts to guard against rising zinc prices. We also secure firm
pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. Management believes these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings. 
We have no contracted commitments for any other commodity items including steel, aluminum, natural gas, copper, zinc or any other
commodity, except for those entered into under the normal course of business.  Other 
At February 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $16.4 million. These letters of credit are
issued to a portion of the Companys customers in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to cover any potential warranty costs and in lieu of performance and bid bonds. In addition, as of February 29, 2012, a warranty reserve in
the amount of $1.7 million has been established to offset any future warranty claims.  The Company has been named as a
defendant in certain lawsuits in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters should not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported value of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for our conclusions. We continually evaluate the information
used to make these estimates as business and economic conditions change. Accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingent liabilities, revenue recognition, impairment of
long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and accounting for income taxes and stock options and stock appreciation rights. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The
development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. More information regarding significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The carrying value of our accounts
receivable is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments. The allowance is determined by historical experience
of uncollected accounts, the level of past due accounts, overall level of outstanding accounts receivable, information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact
the collectability of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. 
  24 


Table of Contents
Accruals for Contingent Liabilities  The amounts we record for estimated
claims, such as self insurance programs, warranty, environmental and other contingent liabilities, requires us to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use past history and experience and other specific
circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded. Actual results may be different than what we estimate.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is recognized for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment upon transfer of title and risk to customers, or based upon the percentage of completion method
of accounting for electrical products built to customer specifications under long term contracts. We typically recognize revenue for the Galvanizing Service Segment at completion of the service unless we specifically agree with the customer to hold
its material for a predetermined period of time after the completion of the galvanizing process and, in that circumstance, we invoice and recognize revenue upon shipment. Customer advanced payments presented in the balance sheets arise from advanced
payments received from our customers prior to shipment of the product and are not related to revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method. The extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is
measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion. Contract costs include direct labor and material and certain indirect costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense
as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are able to be determined. The assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance
resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Identifiable
Intangible Assets and Goodwill  We record impairment losses on long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows
associated with those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. In those situations, impairment losses on long-lived assets are measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the assets fair value, generally
determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows. A significant change in events, circumstances or projected cash flows could result in an impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets. An annual impairment
test of goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows after tax from our operating segments. Based on the present value of the future cash flows, we will determine
whether impairment may exist. A significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years. Variables impacting future cash flows include, but are not limited to, the
level of customer demand for and response to products and services we offer to the power generation market, the electrical transmission and distribution markets, the general industrial market and the hot dip galvanizing market, changes in economic
conditions of these various markets, raw material and natural gas costs and availability of experienced labor and management to implement our growth strategies. Our testing concludes goodwill is not reasonably likely to be impaired. 
Accounting for Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The objectives of accounting
for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and
strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing
authorities.

Table of Contents
Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units  Our
employees and directors are periodically granted restricted stock units, stock options or stock appreciation rights by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The compensation cost of all employee stock-based compensation awards is
measured based on the grant-date fair value of those awards and that cost is recorded as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of
the award).  The valuation of stock based compensation awards, with the exception of restricted stock units, is complex in
that there are a number of variables included in the calculation of the value of the award:   


 

 
 Volatility of our stock price 


 

 
 Expected term of the option 


 

 
 Expected dividend yield 


 

 
 Risk-free interest rate over the expected term 


 

 
 Expected forfeitures  We have elected to use a Black-Scholes pricing model in the valuation of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. Restricted stock units are valued at the stock price on the date of grant.
 These variables are developed using a combination of our internal data with respect to stock price volatility and exercise
behavior of option holders and information from outside sources. The development of each of these variables requires a significant amount of judgment. Changes in the values of the above variables would result in different option valuations and,
therefore, different amounts of compensation cost.  New Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2011, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to fair value measurement, which amends current guidance to achieve common fair
value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This guidance generally represents clarification of fair value measurement standards, but also includes instances where a particular
principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We
will adopt this guidance for our fiscal year beginning March 1, 2012. We do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05), which will enhance
comparability between entities that report under GAAP and those that report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2011-05 requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income
either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for the Companys interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and must be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. Since this new guidance is in regards to presentation, it will have no impact on financial position or results from operations.
 In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for
Impairment (ASU 2011-08). This update is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding an optional qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists under current GAAP is
necessary. Under the amended rule, a company will not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit that contains recorded goodwill unless it concludes, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not (a likelihood
of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of that reporting unit is less than its book value. If such a decline in fair value is deemed more likely than not to have occurred, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test that exists under
current GAAP must be completed. If not, goodwill is deemed not 
  26 


Table of Contents

impaired and no further testing is required until the next annual test date, unless conditions or events before that date raise concerns of potential impairment. The amended goodwill impairment
guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value. ASU 2011-08 is effective for the Company for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company
does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.   


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  Market risk affecting our operations results primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices. We have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and are not a party to
any leveraged derivatives.  In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, we have exposure to commodity pricing for
copper, aluminum, and steel. Increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in our customers contracts, although during difficult market conditions customers may resist these escalation clauses. In addition,
we look to get firm pricing contracts from our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers to minimize risk. We manage our exposures to commodity prices, primarily zinc used in our Galvanizing Services Segment, by utilizing
agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps and fixed contracts to guard against escalating commodity prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. We believe these agreements
ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price escalation.  The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange
related to our Canadian operations.  We do not believe that a hypothetical change of 10% of the interest rate or currency
exchange rate that are currently in effect or a change of 10% of commodity prices would have a significantly adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows as long as we are able to pass along the increases in
commodity prices to our customers. However, there can be no assurance that either interest rates or commodity prices will not change in excess of the 10% hypothetical amount or that we would be able to pass along rising costs of commodity prices to
our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows if we are unable to pass along these increases to our customers.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (a) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b) recorded, processed, summarized and reported

within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
(1) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms.  Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
While the Company believes that its existing controls and procedures have been effective to accomplish their objectives, the Company
intends to continue to examine, refine and document its controls and procedures and to monitor ongoing developments in this area.  The Report
of Management Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page 34.  BDO USA LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm and our independent auditor, has issued an audit report on our internal controls over financial reporting which is included on pages 35-36.  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  There has
not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under
the framework in COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 29, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2012, has been
audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included herein. Managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of Galvan Metal, Inc. whose acquisition was completed on February 1, 2012. The assets acquired from Galvan Metal, Inc. constituted approximately 5% of our total assets as of February 29, 2012, and this
acquisition resulted in revenues and net income constituting 0.1% and 0.4% of our total revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Board of Directors and Shareholders  AZZ
incorporated  Fort Worth, Texas  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AZZ incorporated as of February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 29, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. We have also audited AZZ
incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). AZZ incorporateds management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, financial statement schedule
and to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and the
schedule are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of AZZ incorporated as of February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 29, 2012, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, AZZ incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.

  35 


Table of Contents
Also in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the operations of Galvan Metal (Galvan) which were acquired on February 1, 2012 and which are included in the consolidated balance sheet of AZZ incorporated as of February 29,
2012 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Galvan constituted approximately 5% of total assets as of February 29, 2012 and .1% and . 4% of revenues and net income,
respectively, for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Galvan because of the timing of the acquisition. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of AZZ
incorporated also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Galvan.  /S/ BDO USA, LLP

1.
 Summary of significant accounting policies 
OrganizationAZZ incorporated (the Company AZZ or We)
operates primarily in the United States of America and Canada. Information about the Companys operations by segment is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidationThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of estimatesThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Concentrations of credit riskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade
accounts receivable.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions.
These financial institutions are located throughout the United States and Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one institution. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions
that are considered in the Companys banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. The majority of cash
equivalents are invested in Treasury Funds or FDIC Guaranteed Liquidity programs.  Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the Companys diversity by virtue of two operating segments, the number of customers, and the absence of a concentration of trade accounts receivable in a small number of
customers. The Company performs continuous evaluations of the collectability of trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical losses, economic conditions and customer specific events. After all collection
efforts are exhausted and an account is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Companys balances written off, net of recoveries, in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $183,000, $327,000 and
$231,000, respectively. Collateral is usually not required from customers as a condition of sale.  Revenue
recognitionThe Company recognizes revenue for the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment upon transfer of title and risk to customer or based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for electrical products built to
customer specifications under long-term contracts. We typically recognize revenue for the Galvanizing Services Segment at completion of the service unless we specifically agree with the customer to hold its material for a predetermined period of
time after the completion of the galvanizing process and, in that circumstance, we invoice and recognize revenue upon shipment. Customer advanced payments presented in the balance sheets arise from advanced payments received from our customers prior
to shipment of the product and are not related to revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method. The extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of contract costs
incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion. Contract costs include direct labor and material and certain indirect costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are
made in the period in which such losses are able to be determined. The assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated. 
Cash and cash equivalentsFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. 
InventoriesCost is determined principally using a weighted-average method for the Electrical and Industrial
Products Segment and the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method for the Galvanizing Services Segment.  Property,
plant and equipmentFor financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows: 
 








 Buildings and structures
  
 
10-25 years
  

 Machinery and equipment
  
 
3-15 years
  

 Furniture and fixtures
  
 
3-15 years
  

 Automotive equipment
  
 
3 years
  
 Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments that
significantly extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized.  Long-lived assets, intangible assets
and goodwillPurchased intangible assets included on the balance sheets are comprised of customer lists, backlogs and non-compete agreements. Such intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from two to fifteen years. The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the
undiscounted projected cash flows associated with those assets are less than their carrying amount. In those situations, impairment loss on a long-lived asset is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the assets
fair value. For goodwill, the Company performs an annual impairment test on December 31st each year or as indicators are present. The test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows after tax from our operating segments. Based on the
present value of the future cash flows, we determine whether impairment may exist. A significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years. Variables impacting future
cash flows include, but are not limited to, the level of customer demand for and response to products and services we offer to the power generation market, the electrical transmission and distribution markets, the general industrial market and the
hot dip galvanizing market; changes in economic conditions of these various markets; raw material and natural gas costs and availability of experienced labor and management to implement our growth strategies. 
Debt issue costsDebt issue costs, included in other assets, are amortized using the effective interest rate
method over the term of the debt.  Income taxesIncome tax expense is based on the asset and
liability method. Under this method of accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and laws.
 Stock-based compensationThe Company has granted stock options, stock appreciation rights or
restricted stock units for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors. A discussion of stock-based compensation can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
Financial instruments The Companys financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The fair values of financial instruments approximate the amount of their carrying value. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, the fair value of our notes was
approximately $223.8 million and $224.5 million, respectively.  Derivative financial
instrumentsFrom time to time, the Company uses derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The Companys policy is to use derivatives for risk management purposes only, which includes maintaining the ratio between the Companys
fixed and floating rate debt obligations that management deems appropriate, and prohibits entering into such contracts for trading purposes. The Company enters into derivatives only with counterparties (primarily financial institutions) which have
substantial financial wherewithal to minimize credit risk. As the result of the recent global financial crisis, a number of financial institutions have failed or required government assistance, and counterparties considered substantial may develop
credit risk. The amount of gains or losses from the use of derivative financial instruments has not been and is not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of February 29, 2012, the Company had no
derivative financial instruments.  Warranty reservesWithin other accrued liabilities, a reserve
has been established to provide for the estimated future cost of warranties on a portion of the Companys delivered products. Management periodically reviews the reserves, and adjustments are made accordingly. A provision for warranty on
products is made on the basis of the Companys historical experience and identified warranty issues. Warranties cover such factors as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and workmanship. 
The following is a roll-forward of amounts accrued for warranties:

 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources and includes all changes in equity during a period except those
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  On January 21, 2011, we entered into
an additional Note Purchase Agreement, (the 2011 Agreement) and incurred fixed rate, long-term indebtedness of $125 million in relation to the 2011 Agreement. See note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In anticipation of the
issuance of Senior Notes thereunder, we entered into a treasury lock hedging transaction with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) in order to eliminate the variability of cash flows on the forecasted fixed rate coupon of the debt during the
pre-issuance period. The hedging transaction settled during the Companys third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2011, and the Company received a payment from BAML in the amount of $834,416 resulting therefrom.

The notional value of the hedge was $75 million and qualified for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge. The gain on the settlement has been recorded as a component of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 10 year loan. Amortization for interest expense was recorded in the amount of $83,442 for fiscal 2012. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income also includes foreign currency translation adjustments from our Canadian
subsidiary, Blenkhorn and Sawle (B&S).  Foreign Currency TranslationThe local currency is the
functional currency for the Companys Canadian operations. Related assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at exchange rates existing at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at
weighted-average exchange rates. The foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

 Stock compensation 
The Company has two share-based compensation plans (the Plan or Plans). The
purpose of both Plans is to promote the growth and prosperity of the Company by permitting the Company to grant to its employees, directors and advisors various types of restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and options to purchase
common stock of the Company. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plans is 2,500,000 shares. As of February 29, 2012, the Company has approximately 621,642 shares reserved for future issuance under the Plans. 
Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
Restricted stock unit awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date. These awards generally
have a three year cliff vesting schedule but may vest early in accordance with the applicable Plans accelerated vesting provisions.  Activity in our non-vested restricted stock unit awards for the year ended February 29, 2012 is as follows:

$24.35 and $18.12, respectively.  Stock Appreciation Rights and Option Awards 
Stock appreciation rights and option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of our common
stock on the date of grant. These awards generally have a contractual term of 7 years and vest ratably over a period of three years although some may vest immediately on issuance. These awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan which allows employees of the Company to purchase common stock of
the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. Offerings under this plan have a duration of 24 months. On the first day of an offering period (the enrollment date) the participant is granted the option to purchase shares on each exercise date
at the lower of 85% of the market value of a 
  52 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 

share of our common stock on the enrollment date or the exercise date. The participants right to purchase common stock under the plan is restricted to no more than $25,000 per calendar year
and the participant may not purchase more than 5,000 shares during any offering period. Participants may terminate their interest in a given offering or a given exercise period by withdrawing all of their accumulated payroll deductions at any time
prior to the end of the offering period. The fair value of the estimated number of shares to be issued under each offering is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Common shares estimated to be issued under each offering for
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 16,053, 49,793 and 17,542 shares, respectively  Assumptions used in the
Black-Scholes option pricing model for the past three fiscal years are as follows for all stock appreciation rights plans and employee stock purchase plans:

 Directors Grants 
During each of the past three fiscal years the Company granted each of its seven independent directors 1,000 shares of
the Companys common stock. These common stock grants were valued at $50.84, $40.92 and $32.35, per share for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was the market price of our common stock on the grant date. 
Share-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits related to all the plans listed above were as follows:

from stock options exercised for the years ended February 28 or 29, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $48, $379,955 and $466,117, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from options exercised each of these years totaled
$130,627, $100,213 and $78,243, respectively.  The Companys policy is to issue shares required under
these Plans from the Companys treasury shares or from the Companys authorized but unissued shares. The company has no formal or informal plan to repurchase shares on the open market to satisfy these requirements.

 On May 25, 2006, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
(the Credit Agreement) by and between AZZ and Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America). As subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement provides for an $80 million unsecured revolving line of credit, maturing on May 25,
2014. The Credit Agreement allows for the payment of cash dividends in an aggregate amount of up to $15 million annually and the repurchase of up to $50 million of AZZ Common Stock over the life of the Credit Agreement. The facility is used to
provide for working capital needs, capital improvements, debt repayment, future acquisitions and letter of credit needs.  The Credit Agreement provides for various financial covenants consisting of a) Minimum Consolidated Net WorthMaintain on a consolidated basis net worth equal to at least the sum of $182.3 million
plus 50% of future net income, b) Maximum Leverage RatioMaintain on a consolidated basis a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.25:1.0, c) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Maintain on a consolidated basis a
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least 1.75:1.0 and d) Capital ExpendituresNot to make Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on a consolidated basis in an amount in excess of $30
million.  The Credit Agreement also provides for an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% over the
Eurodollar Rate and Commitment Fees ranging from .20% to .30% depending on our Leverage Ratio.  At
February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, we had no outstanding debt against the revolving credit facility. As of February 29, 2012, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $16.4 million, which left approximately $63.6
million of additional credit available under the Credit Agreement.  On March 31, 2008, the Company
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which the Company issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.24% unsecured Senior Notes (2008 Notes) due March 31, 2018
through a private placement (the 2008 Note Offering). These 2008 Notes are for 10 years with interest only paid semi annually for the first 4 years and then principal payments of $14.3 million paid each year starting on March 31,
2012 plus applicable interest paid each quarter. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Companys payment obligations with respect to the 2008 Notes may be accelerated upon any Event of Default, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement.
 The Company entered into an additional Note Purchase Agreement on January 21, 2011 (the 2011
Agreement), pursuant to which the Company issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.42% unsecured Senior Notes (the 2011 Notes), due in January of 2021, through a private placement (the 2011 Note
Offering). Pursuant to the 2011 Agreement, the Companys payment obligations with respect to the 
  54 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 

2011 Notes could be accelerated under certain circumstances. The Company anticipates using the proceeds from the 2011 Note Offering for possible future acquisitions, working capital needs,
capital improvements, debt repayment and future cash dividend payments.  In connection with the 2008 Note
Offering the Company entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment contained the consent of Bank of America to the 2008 Note Offering, amended the Credit Agreement to provide that the 2008 Note Offering will not constitute
a default under the Credit Agreement and amended Credit Agreement to reflect the same financial covenants as the 2008 Notes. In connection with the 2011 Note Offering, the Company obtained the consent of Bank of America to the 2011 Note Offering and
the agreement of Bank of America that the 2011 Note Offering will not constitute a default under the Credit Agreement.  The 2008 Notes and 2011 Notes provide for various financial covenants of a) Minimum Consolidated Net Worth - Maintain on a consolidated basis net worth equal to at least the sum of $116.9 million plus 50%
of future net income; b) Maximum Ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA - Maintain a ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA (as defined in Note Purchase Agreement) not to exceed 3.25:1.00; c) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  Maintain

 Commodity pricing 
The Company manages its exposures to commodity prices through the use of the following: 
In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, the Company has exposure to commodity pricing for copper, aluminum and
steel. Because the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment does not commit contractually to minimum volumes, increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in customer contracts, although during continuing
difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be obtainable. In addition, we look to get firm pricing contacts from our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers to minimize risk. 
In the Galvanizing Services Segment, the Company utilizes contracts with our zinc suppliers that include protective caps
to guard against rising zinc prices. The Company also secures firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. There is no contracted volume purchase commitments associated with the natural gas or zinc agreements.
Management believes these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price escalation.  We have no contracted commitments for any other commodity items including steel, aluminum, natural gas, cooper, zinc, or any other commodity, except for those entered into under the normal course of
business.  Other 
At February 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $16.4 million. These letters of
credit are issued to customers in our Electrical and Industrial Products Segment to cover any potential warranty costs and in lieu of performance and bid bonds. In addition, as of February 29, 2012, a warranty reserve in the amount of $1.7
million has been established to offset any future warranty claims.

The Company has been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits in the
normal course in business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters should not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

 Acquisitions 
On February 1, 2012, AZZ Blenkhorn & Sawle Limited (B&S), a corporation
existing under the laws of the Province of New Brunswick and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ, acquired substantially all of the assets of Galvan Metal, Inc., including a galvanizing plant located in Montreal, Quebec and related equipment
and supplies. The purchase price for this transaction was $29.1 million ($27.4 million net of cash acquired on hand at Galvan Metal, Inc. of $1.7 million). As of February 29, 2012, we had expensed $.5 million in acquisition costs related to the
Galvan Metal, Inc. acquisition. The acquisition costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. This acquisition was made to expand our galvanizing services geographic footprint internationally. 
On August 3, 2010, we completed our acquisition of North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc.
(NGA), a leading provider of corrosion protection for iron and steel components fabricated by its customers. AZZ gained control of NGA on June 14, 2010 by acquiring approximately 83% of its outstanding capital stock (calculated on a
fully diluted basis) through a cash tender offer and caused NGA to be merged with and into an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AZZ created solely for such acquisition, with NGA as the surviving entity. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger among AZZ, such subsidiary of AZZ and NGA, upon the completion of this merger each share of the remaining 17% of NGAs outstanding capital stock (i.e., the shares not held by AZZ) was converted into the right to receive the same
per-share cash consideration paid in such tender offer. This merger resulted in NGA being an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AZZ. The total cash purchase price for NGA was $132 million ($104 million net of cash acquired on hand at NGA of $28
million). The acquisition was funded from our cash on hand and our existing credit facility. We had expensed $1.9 million in acquisition costs related to the NGA acquisition. Acquisition costs are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses. This acquisition is included in the Galvanizing Services Segment. The acquisition was made to expand our geographic footprint.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was
allocated to NGAs net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of June 14, 2010, the date on which AZZ acquired control of NGA through the acquisition of approximately 83% of NGAs outstanding capital
stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis). The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets are recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
of NGA assumed at the date of acquisition:

 All of the $28.0 million of intangible assets acquired are assigned to customer related
intangibles and other. The goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to a larger geographic footprint and also synergies expected to arise. These intangible assets are being amortized and have a weighted average
life of 12.4 years. Goodwill of $43.1 million arising from the acquisition has been allocated to the Galvanizing Services Segment and will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Total revenues and earnings of NGA reflected in fiscal 2012 were
$83.0 million and $18.6 million, respectively, and $49.7 million and $12.2 million for fiscal 2011, respectively.  The following consolidated pro forma information assumes that the acquisition of NGA took place on March 1, 2010 for the income statements for the years ended February 28, 2011 and
February 28, 2010. For fiscal 2012 there is no pro forma information to present as it is assumed the acquisition took place on March 1, 2010.

 Subsequent Events 
On April 30, 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of
Nuclear Logistics, Inc. (NLI), a Fort Worth, Texas based provider of electrical and mechanical equipment and services for enhancing the safety of nuclear facilities. The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing

conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, is anticipated to close on June 1, 2012 and is a part
of the stated AZZ strategy to expand our offerings in the Electrical and Industrial Products segment to enhance our presence in the Power Generation market.  The Asset Purchase Agreement provides for the acquisition by AZZ of substantially all of the assets of NLI for cash consideration in the amount of $80 million and the assumption of current liabilities
plus $4.8 million of notes payable, which will be paid at closing. Additionally, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, AZZ could be obligated to make an additional payment of up to $20 million to NLI based on future financial performance of the
NLI assets.  On April 29, 2012, the company experienced a fire at our galvanizing plant located in
Joliet, Illinois. The fire consumed the entire plant and as such has been deemed a complete loss. There were no injuries and as far as can be ascertained, no environmental damages. The company is insured against such incidences and carries property
insurance for replacement costs as well as comparable business interruption insurance. The company plans to transport product to be galvanized from this facility to other AZZ locations in our expansive network of galvanizing plants in Illinois and
the surrounding areas. The company is compiling a time table to restart the facility and expects the loss to be covered by insurance.
