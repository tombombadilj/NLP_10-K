Overview
 
MISONIX,
INC. ("Misonix" or the "Company") is a New York corporation which, through its predecessors, was first
organized in 1959. The Company designs, manufactures, develops and markets minimally invasive ultrasonic surgical device
products. These products include the BoneScalpelTM cutting system(“BoneScalpel”) which is used among other things
for surgical procedures of the spine and on maxillofacial procedures, the SonaStar® Surgical Aspirator
(“SonaStar”) which is used to emulsify and remove soft and hard tumors, the SonicOne® Wound Cleansing and
Debridement System (“SonicOne”) that offers tissue specific debridement and cleansing of wounds for effective
removal of devitalized tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable cells, and the AutoSonix ultrasound cutting and
coagulating system (“AutoSonix”) which is distributed and marketed for Misonix through an agreement with Covidien
Ltd. Misonix also markets its Lysonix ultrasound assisted liposuction device (“Lysonix”) through Mentor
Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (“Mentor”).
 
The
Company's 100% owned subsidiary, Hearing Innovations, Inc. ("Hearing Innovations"), is a development company with patented
HiSonic ultrasonic technology for the treatment of profound deafness and tinnitus.
 
In
fiscal 2012, approximately 41% of the Company's net sales were to foreign markets. These sales had credit risks as some large
distributor sales were not secured by letters of credit, but given credit terms, after analysis on open account. Some open
account sales require a 50% down payment which generally covers the cost of the equipment. Foreign country sales on open
credit terms do not exceed sixty days. Distributors that are not given credit terms either pay in advance or have letters of
credit securing the sales. All foreign sales are remitted to Misonix in U.S. currency.
 
Discontinued
Operations
 
Laboratory
and Forensic Safety Products Business
 
On
October 19, 2011, Misonix sold its Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business, which comprised substantially all of the Laboratory
and Scientific products segment, to Mystaire, Inc. (“Mystaire”) for $1.5 million in cash plus a potential additional
payment of up to an aggregate $500,000 based upon 30% of net sales in excess of $2.0 million for each of the three years following
the closing (the “earn-out”). The Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business manufactured and marketed ductless
fume, laminar airflow and polymerase chain reaction workstations both domestically and internationally with revenues for fiscal
2011 of approximately $2.1 million.
 
In
accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Mystaire, Misonix retained among other items, the existing accounts receivable,
inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business. After considering the
proceeds received of $1,500,000 in cash, professional fees of $25,000 in connection with the sale and the net book value of the
assets sold of $24,000, which was comprised primarily of property and equipment, Misonix reported a gain on sale of $1,451,000
and recorded income taxes of $242,000 on the gain during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The earn-out will not be factored
into the gain on sale until it is earned by Misonix.
 
In
accordance with the terms of the Transition and Manufacturing Services Agreement with Mystaire, which was entered into as part
of the sale, Misonix continued for a period of six weeks to manufacture and deliver products for orders received prior to the closing
date as well as to provide product to Mystaire as transition inventory, which transition period was completed on November 30, 2011.
 
The
results of operations of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business will be presented as discontinued operations for
all periods presented as Misonix does not have any significant cash flow or continuing involvement in this business. Following
the sale of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business, the Company operates in one reportable segment, Medical Devices.
 
Labcaire
Systems
 
On
August 4, 2009, the Company sold its Labcaire Systems, Ltd. ("Labcaire") subsidiary to PuriCore
International Limited ("PuriCore Limited") for a total purchase price of up to $5.6 million. The Company received
$3.6 million at closing and a promissory note in the principal amount of $1 million, payable in equal installments of
$250,000 on the next four anniversaries of the closing. During the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company received the first
installment. The note receivable was discounted over the four years using a 4% imputed interest rate. This rate was
consistent with published discounts. The discounted value of the note ($900,000) was used to determine gain or loss on the
sale and the remaining outstanding balance is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, with the current
portion reflected as a component of notes receivable. The Company was also to receive a commission paid on sales for the
period commencing on the date of closing and ending on December 31, 2013 of 8% of the pass through Automated Endoscope
Reprocessing ("AER") and Drying Cabinet products, and 5% of license fees from any chemical licenses marketed by
Labcaire directly associated with sale of AERs, specifically for the disinfection of the endoscope. The aggregate commission
payable to the Company was also to be subject to a maximum payment of $1 million. The aggregate commission was not
recognized in determining the gain or loss on the sale of Labcaire until the commission was to be paid. As of June 30, 2011,
there were no commissions paid. For the year ended June 30, 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of Labcaire
of $295,879. Results of Labcaire operations have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods
presented.
 
In
January 2011, PuriCore Limited initiated a lawsuit against the Company in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial
Court, Royal Courts of Justice, London, England (Claim No. 2011-42) (the "Lawsuit"). In the Lawsuit, PuriCore Limited
claimed damages from the Company in respect of breach of warranties contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated August 4,
2009 (the "SPA"), pursuant to which the Company sold Labcaire to PuriCore Limited. PuriCore Limited claimed damages of
£2,167,000 or approximately $3,600,000, plus interest and its legal costs. The Company denied the allegations contained in
the Lawsuit.
 
On
July 19, 2011, PuriCore Limited and the Company reached an agreement to settle the Lawsuit (the "Settlement"). The
Settlement provides that the Company (i) forgive in full PuriCore Limited and PuriCore plc's obligation under the SPA to pay up
to $1 million of the previously unrecorded, contingent commissions (as described above); (ii) pay PuriCore, Inc. ("PuriCore"),
an affiliate of PuriCore Limited, $650,000 towards PuriCore Limited's legal costs which had been accrued for as of June 30, 2011
and recorded as a component of loss from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2011 and (iii) enter into a Product
License and Distribution Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2011, with PuriCore (the "Distribution Agreement").
 

3
 

 
Pursuant
to the Distribution Agreement, the Company has been granted the right to distribute PuriCore's Vashe®solution products
in the United States, on a private label basis, as an antibacterial, microbial irrigating solution for the treatment of human wound
care in conjunction with therapeutic ultrasonic procedures (the "Field"). PuriCore has agreed, subject to modification,
not to sell the products that are the subject of the Distribution Agreement (the "Licensed Products") to any other therapeutic
ultrasound company for distribution in the Field in the United States ("Exclusivity"). The Company has agreed not to
sell or distribute in the United States in the Field any irrigating solution that has anti-microbial properties otherthan the Licensed
Products so long as the Company has Exclusivity.
 
The
Distribution Agreement is for a three (3) year term with automatic renewals for successive two (2) year periods; provided that
the Company and PuriCore have agreed upon sales volume targets for each renewal period (such volume targets not to increase by
more than ten (10%) percent year over year unless otherwise agreed) and provided that the cost terms shall be no less favorable
than the twelve (12) months leading up to the start of such renewal period. In no event will the Distribution Agreement survive
beyond the expiration or invalidation of all of PuriCore's patents.
 
During
the initial three year term of the Distribution Agreement, the Company is obligated to either purchase or pay a minimum of $2
million in gross margin value to PuriCore for the Licensed Products (the "Minimum Payment"). The Minimum Payment is
subject to downward adjustment and elimination in the event that (i) PuriCore chooses to eliminate Exclusivity,
(ii) the Company's right to manufacture the Licensed Products under certain conditions has been triggered but the
Company is unable to manufacture the Licensed Products or to have the Licensed Products manufactured for it by third parties
or (iii) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has made a final determination that prohibits the
sale of the licensed products for use in the Field. As of June 30, 2012, Misonix has incurred approximately $321,750 towards
the Minimum Payment, leaving a Minimum Payment balance of $1,678,250. At the start of fiscal 2012, the discounted value
of the note was $650,000. During fiscal 2012, Misonix has purchased $451,883 of Licensed Products from Puricore, which has
been offset against the note, leaving a note receivable balance of $298,117.
 
The
Company has the right to manufacture the Licensed Products if PuriCore is unable to meet certain performance standards and will
pay PuriCore a royalty after the $2 million in gross margin value requirement has been satisfied if the Company is then manufacturing
the Licensed Products.
 
During
a renewal period, PuriCore may terminate the Distribution Agreement (i) if the Company fails to purchase the agreed upon volume
target for such renewal period and does not cure such failure in accordance with the Distribution Agreement or (ii) upon twelve
(12) months’ notice.
 
High
Intensity Focused Ultrasound Technology
 
In
consideration for the sale of its rights to the High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“HIFU”) technology to USHIFU, LLC
(“USHIFU”) in May 2010, Misonix will receive up to approximately $5.8 million, paid out of an earn-out of 7% of gross
revenues received by USHIFU related to the business being sold up to the time the Company has received the first $3 million and
thereafter 5% of the gross revenues up to the $5.8 million. Commencing 90 days after each December 31st and beginning
December 31, 2011, the payments will be the greater of (a) $250,000 or (b) 7% of gross revenues received up to the time the Company
has received the first $3 million and thereafter 5% of gross revenues up to the $5.8 million.During the three months ended June
30, 2012, the Company received $254,788 related to an earn-out from the sale, which has been recorded as a component of gain on
the sale of discontinued operations during the period.
 
Medical
Devices
 
On
June 1, 2011, Misonix entered a new five-year exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with Anika Therapeutics S.r.l., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Anika Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANIK), a leader in products for tissue protection, healing, and repair. Misonix
will sell and distribute Anika's Hyalomatrix® product, a skin substitute based on hyaluronic acid technology. Hyalomatrix is
indicated for treatment of a wide range of acute and chronic wounds and will be a companion product for the SonicOne.
 
Anika
will manufacture and supply finished product to Misonix, while Misonix will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization
in the United States. A recognized leader in advanced ultrasonic wound management, Misonix has U.S. sales and marketing organizations
for both the surgery and clinic settings, where acute and chronic wounds are treated.

On
July 19, 2011, Misonix and PuriCore entered into the Distribution Agreement whereby Misonix will distribute, on a limited
exclusive basis with respect to other therapeutic ultrasound companies in the United States, a private label version of
PuriCore's Vashe wound therapy product trademarked as SOMA, which is a solution intended for cleansing, irrigating,
moistening, and debriding acute and chronic dermal lesions. Use of the new product will be emphasized in conjunction with
clinical procedures performed with Misonix ultrasonic systems and gives surgeons and clinicians an expanding line of products
for treating wounds. The Distribution Agreement is for three years with a two year extension contingent on meeting certain
goals. As part of this Distribution Agreement, Misonix has the obligation over a three year period to either purchase or pay
a minimum of $2 million in gross margin value to PuriCore. See “Discontinued Operations – Labcaire
Systems”.
 
In
October 1996, the Company entered into a twenty-year license agreement (the "Covidien License") with Covidien Ltd.
The Covidien License covers the further development of the Company's medical technology relating to ultrasonic cutting, which uses
high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic surgery. The Covidien License gives Covidien
exclusive worldwide marketing and sales rights for this technology and device. Total sales of this device were approximately $1,484,000
and $3,260,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Total royalties from sales of this device
were approximately $488,000 and $550,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
The
Company is currently negotiating a new distribution agreement with Mentor for the sale, marketing and distribution of the
Lysonix soft tissue aspirator used for cosmetic surgery. Total sales of this device were approximately $1,492,000 and
$900,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
Market
and Customers
 
The
Company relies on its licensee, Covidien, for marketing the AutoSonix product. The Company relies on Mentor, Aesculap, Inc. (“Aesculap”),
independent sales agents, and other regional distributors for marketing the SonaStar and BoneScalpel, and the Lysonix products,
exclusively in the United States. The Company sells its SonicOne Wound Cleansing and Debridement System for certain other applications
through direct sales persons and sales agents throughout the United States. All products are sold through distributors or representatives
outside the United States.

In
September 2007, the Company completed an agreement with Mentor for domestic sales of its ultrasound assisted liposuction product,
the Lysonix. Mentor agreed to minimum purchase order provisions for the Lysonix for a one year term commencing September 30, 2007,
and successive annual renewals upon mutual agreement by the companies. The agreement with Mentor for the Lysonix in the United
States is in the process of being negotiated for renewal.
 
Manufacturing
and Supply
 
The
Company manufactures and assembles its medical device products at its production facility located in Farmingdale, New York. The
Company's products include components manufactured by other companies in the United States. The Company is not dependent upon any
single source of supply and has no long-term supply agreements. The Company believes that it will not encounter difficulty in obtaining
materials, supplies and components adequate for its anticipated short-term needs.
 
Competition
 
Competition
in the medical device products industry is rigorous with many companies having significant capital resources, large research laboratories
and extensive distribution systems in excess of the Company's. Some of the Company's major competitors are Johnson & Johnson,
Valley Lab, a division of Tyco Healthcare, Integra Life Sciences, Inc., Sööring, and Stryker.

Regulatory
Requirements
 
The
Company's medical device products are subject to the regulatory requirements of the FDA. A medical device as defined by the FDA
is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including
a component, part, or accessory which is recognized in the official National Formulary or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any
supplement to such listings, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment,
or prevention of disease, in man or animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals,
and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or animals
and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes (a "medical
device"). The Company's products that are subject to FDA regulations for product labeling and promotion comply with all applicable
regulations. The Company is listed with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and has the appropriate FDA Establishment Numbers
in place. The Company has a post-market monitoring system in place such as Complaint Handling and Medical Device Reporting procedures.

Item 1A. Risk
Factors.
 
In
addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto,
the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You
should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth immediately prior
to the beginning of Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The
following list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact upon the Company’s ability to achieve results
discussed in any forward leading statement. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such
factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
 
Risks
Related to Our Business
 
We
are subject to extensive medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval process for our products and, in some
cases, may not ultimately result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.
 
Our
products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act"), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other
regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they
can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance,
approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing
approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:
  

•take a significant period of time;
 

•require the expenditure of substantial resources;
 

•involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;
 

•require changes to the products; and
 

•result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.
 

11
 

 
Even
after products have received marketing approval or clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA can be withdrawn due
to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. There can be
no assurance that we will receive the required clearances from the FDA for new products or modifications to existing products on
a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not be subsequently withdrawn. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with
a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products,
operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions
of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
We
may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes.
 
As
a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance
with the FDA's Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations,
including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations
require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a medical device may have
caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or
serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through
periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to
sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure
to meet regulatory quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Future
intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.
 
We
operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common
for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the
marketing of new devices. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict.
Future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products
and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any
of our products is successfully challenged, and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent,
our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
We
may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights.
 
Patents
and other proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies
will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological
innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue
a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary
devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective
patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others.
We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights
have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future
patent applications will result in issued patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be
challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid.
 
In
addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against
claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming to us and no assurances can be
made that any lawsuit will be successful.
 
The
invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual
property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Future
product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, may adversely
affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain customers.
 
The
design, manufacture and marketing of medical device products of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability
claims. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other
products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure
of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one
or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals
or by groups seeking to represent a class.
 
Anyone
or any company can bring an action against Misonix.
 
Our
judicial system allows anyone to bring a claim against the Company and force the Company to defend itself even if the claim is
baseless. The defense may or may not be covered by the Company’s insurance, the result of which could ultimately create a
burden on the Company dependent upon the outcome.
 

12
 

 
We
may not be successful in our strategic initiatives to become a medical device company.
 
Our
strategic initiatives intend to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, quality medical devices that satisfy their
needs, as well as focus the Company on our medical device platform. If we are unsuccessful in our strategic initiatives, we may
be unable to continue to grow our business significantly or may record asset impairment charges in the future.
 
Our
future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, which requires significant research and development, clinical
trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable
product.
 
In
order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and development programs largely on
the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and opportunities.
 
As
a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products, we conduct and participate in
numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent
clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market's
perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals from the FDA, our position in, and
share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.
 
New
products may not be accepted in the market.
 
We
are now, and will continue to be, developing new products and introducing them into the market. There can be no assurance that
any new product will be accepted by the market. New products are sometimes introduced into the market in a prototype format and
may need later revisions or design changes before they operate in a manner to be accepted in the market. As a result of the introduction
of new products, there is some risk that revenue expectations may not be met and in some cases the product may not achieve market
acceptance.
 
We
face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry.
 
The
medical device product market is highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each
market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which have greater financial and marketing
resources than we do.
 
Additionally,
the medical device product market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments
by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technology may make our products or proposed products obsolete or
less competitive and may negatively impact our revenues. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to
develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines
and markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technology and products,
obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products. Failure to develop
new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
 
Consolidation
in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant
market segments.
 
The
cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators,
regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including
hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market
segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing
decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies
and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations
and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices
of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
 
We
may experience disruption in supply due to our dependence on our suppliers to continue to ship product requirements and our inability
to obtain suppliers of certain components for our products.
 
Our
suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols
and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions, labor shortages or environmental factors.
In addition, we purchase both raw materials used in our products and finished goods from various suppliers and may have to rely
on a single source supplier for certain components of our products where there are no alternatives are available. Although we anticipate
that we have adequate sources of supply and/or inventory of these components to handle our production needs for the foreseeable
future, if we are unable to secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the materials we depend on to manufacture our products,
if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find suppliers
at an acceptable cost, then the manufacture of our products may be disrupted, which could increase our costs and have a material
adverse effect on our business.
 

13
 

 
If
we fail to manage any expansion or acquisition, our business could be impaired.
 
We
may in the future acquire one or more technologies, products or companies that complement our business. We may not be able to effectively
integrate these into our business and any such acquisition could bring additional risks, exposures and challenges to the Company.
In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees,
increase our expenses, subject us to liabilities and increase our risk of litigation, all of which could harm our business. If
we use cash to acquire technologies, products, or companies, such use may divert resources otherwise available for other purposes.
If we use our common stock to acquire technologies, products, or companies, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution.
If we fail to manage any expansions or acquisition, our business could be impaired.
 
Our
agreements and contracts entered into with partners and other third parties may not be successful.
 
We
signed in the past and may pursue in the future contracts and agreements with third parties to assist in our marketing, manufacturing,
selling and distribution efforts. We cannot assure you that any agreements or arrangements entered into will be successful.
 
The
current disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms (or at all) and
have other adverse effects on us.
 
The
United States credit markets have recently experienced historic dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused financing
to be unavailable in many cases and even if available caused spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These
circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers able to find financing
less attractive, and in many cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Continued uncertainty
in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, Federal
legislation to deal with the current disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.
 
The
fluctuation of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
 
Our
revenues and results of operations have in the past and will likely vary in the future from quarter to quarter due to a number
of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. You should not rely
on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. It is likely that in
some future quarters, our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this
event, the price of our common stock may fall.
 
We
may not be able to attract and retain additional key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, or we may lose existing
key management, sales and marketing or technical personnel, which may delay our development and marketing efforts.
 
We
depend on a number of key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key
employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability
to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals.
We face intense competition for qualified personnel, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers, and we do not
know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
 
Future
changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse or unexpected
revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.
 
A
change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on
our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting
pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred
and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported
financial results or the way we conduct our business.
 
Adverse
litigation results could affect our business.
 
Litigation
can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision
could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
 
The
Affordable Healthcare for America Act includes provisions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including
an excise tax on the sales of most medical devices.
 
On
March 21, 2010, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which President Obama signed into
law on March 23, 2010. While we are continuing to evaluate this legislation and its potential impact on the Company, it may adversely
affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.
 
Specifically,
one of the new law's components is a 2.3% excise tax on sales of most medical devices, starting in 2013. This tax may put increased
cost pressure on medical device companies, including our customers, and may lead our customers to reduce their orders for products
we produce or to request that we reduce the prices we charge for products we produce in order to offset the tax.

Fiscal
years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:
 
Net
sales: Net sales increased $3,304,971 to $15,678,000 in fiscal 2012, from $12,373,029 in fiscal 2011. The increase in
sales is primarily due to higher BoneScalpel revenue of $2,276,928, higher SonaStar revenue of $1,787,434, higher Lysonix
revenue of $473,960, higher service revenue of $329,402 and higher SonicOne revenue of $191,602, partially offset by lower

Gross
profit: Gross profit increased to 58.8% in fiscal 2012 from 57.3% in fiscal 2011. Gross profit for the three months ended
June 30, 2012 was 57.7% as compared to 56.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2011 due to increased sales of the BoneScalpel.
 
Selling
expenses: Selling expenses increased $1,146,047 to $5,031,831 (32.2% of sales) in fiscal 2012 from $3,885,784 (31.4% of
sales) in fiscal 2011. The increase in selling expenses is related to higher salary expenses of $358,821, higher commissions of
$286,308, higher advertising expenses of $192,679, higher travel expenses of $147,773, higher depreciation of demonstration equipment
units related to more evaluation units in the field of $151,127 and other unfavorable expenses of $9,339. Selling expenses for
the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased $226,349 to $1,411,752 (26.9% of sales) from $1,185,403 (31.5% of sales) for the
three months ended June 30, 2011. The increase in selling expenses is due to increased salary expense of $145,277 (increased headcount)
higher travel expense of $43,700, higher depreciation expenses of $23,961 due to new demonstration units in the field and higher
advertising expense of $15,901, partially offset by other favorable expenses of $2,490.
 
General
and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased $122,967 to $4,376,554 in fiscal 2012 from $4,499,521
in fiscal 2011. The decrease in expenses is mainly due to lower accounting expenses of $59,125, lower insurance cost of $49,581
and lower rent expense of $36,141, partially offset by higher consulting expense of $17,264 and other unfavorable expenses of $4,616.
For the three months ended June 30, 2012, general and administrative expenses decreased $62,863. This decrease is due to lower
legal expense of $23,548, lower employee welfare expense of $16,082, lower insurance expense of $11,186, and other favorable expenses
of $12,047.
 
Research
and development expenses: Research and development expenses decreased $139,402 to $1,292,225 in fiscal 2012 from $1,431,627
in fiscal 2011. The decrease is related to lower product development material costs of $112,105 and lower employee welfare costs
of $27,481, partially offset by other unfavorable expenses of $184. For the three months ended June 30, 2012, research and development
expenses increased $9,347 to $345,241 from $335,894 for the three months ending June 30, 2011.
 
Other
income: Other income decreased $3,689 to $686,189 in fiscal 2012 from $689,878 in fiscal 2011. For the three months ended
June 30, 2012, other income increased $24,583 to $136,768 from $112,185 for the three months ended June 30, 2011. The increase
is due to lower royalty expenses of $11,936, favorable foreign exchange of $5,483, higher royalty income of $3,130 and other favorable
expenses of $4,034.
 
Income
taxes: In fiscal 2012 the income tax benefit for continuing operations had an effective tax rate of 24%. Overall,
when considering discontinued operations, the Company had minimal income tax expense. In prior years the Company established
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to the net loss from operations over the past 5 years which caused
management to conclude that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets may not be fully realized.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources:
 
Working
capital at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 was $11,734,000 and $10,233,000, respectively. For the year ended June 30,
2012, cash used in operations totaled $1,492,000. The major use of cash from operations was related to higher accounts receivables
of $1,112,000 and lower accounts payables and other accrued expenses of $432,000 during the year ended June 30, 2012. For the fiscal
year 2012, cash used in investing activities totaled $734,000, primarily consisting of the purchase of property, plant and equipment
and increased demonstration equipment for the BoneScalpel during the regular course of business along with the purchase of assets
from Aesculap. For the fiscal year 2012, cash used in financing activities was $11,000. Cash provided by discontinued operations
was $1,628,000.
 
As
of June 30, 2012 the Company has a cash balance of $6,273,015 and believes it has sufficient cash to finance operations for at
least the next 12 months.
 
The
Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. At June 30, 2012, these financial institutions held cash
that was approximately $6,034,000 in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other government
agencies.

Other
 
In
the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the Company.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies:
 
General:
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report includes a summary of the Company's significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of its financial statements. The Company's discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going
basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, goodwill, property,
plant and equipment, stock based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following are our more
critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
 
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable, principally trade, are generally due within 30 to 90 days
and are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of
their current credit information. The Company continuously monitors aging reports, collections and payments from customers and
maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues
that have been identified. While such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established,
the Company cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future. The Company writes off accounts receivable
when they become uncollectible.
 
Inventories:
Inventories, consisting of purchased materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (determined
by the first-in, first-out method) or market. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities
and obsolescence. Our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales by product, projections of future demand by product,
the risk of technological or competitive obsolescence for our products, general market conditions, and the feasibility of reworking
or using excess or obsolete products or components in the production or assembly of other products that are not obsolete or for
which we do not have excess quantities in inventory. To the extent that we determine there are excess or obsolete quantities, we
record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products to adjust their carrying value to estimated
net realizable value. If future demand or market conditions are different from our projections, or if we are unable to rework excess
or obsolete quantities into other products, we may change the recorded amount of inventory valuation reserves through a charge
or reduction in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made.
 
Long
Lived Assets: Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Minor replacements and maintenance and repair expenses are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over estimated
useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life
of the related asset, whichever is shorter. Inventory items included in property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the
straight line method over estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. We evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable. When an evaluation is required, we estimate
the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets. If the cost of the asset or group of
assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge would be recorded. Our estimates of future cash
flows are based on our experience and internal business plans. Our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic
conditions, product demand and pricing. Although we believe our estimates are appropriate, significant differences in the actual
performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently
recorded.
 

22
 

 
Revenue
Recognition: The Company records revenue upon shipment for products shipped F.O.B. shipping point. Products shipped F.O.B.
destination points are recorded as revenue when received at the point of destination. Shipments under agreements with distributors
are not subject to return and payment for these shipments is not contingent on sales by the distributor. Accordingly, the Company
recognizes revenue on shipments to distributors in the same manner as with other customers. Fees from exclusive license agreements
are recognized ratably over the terms of the respective agreements. Service contract and royalty income are recognized when earned.
 
Goodwill:
Goodwill is not amortized. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate,
legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of significant assets or products. Application
of these impairment tests requires significant judgments, including estimation of cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts,
estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination
of our weighted-average cost of capital. Changes in the projected cash flows and discount rate estimates and assumptions underlying
the valuation of goodwill could materially affect the determination of fair value at acquisition or during subsequent periods when
tested for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal 2012 and 2011 in the respective fourth
quarter. No impairment of goodwill was deemed to exist.
 
Income
Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant judgment
is required in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets including estimates of future sufficient taxable income to
support the recovery of tax assets.
 
Financial
accounting standards establish guidance for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position
only it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions should be measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Financial accounting
standards also provide guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosures
requirements.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation: The fair value of the Company’s outstanding stock options is estimated based upon option price, volatility,
the risk free rate, and the average time the shares are held. It is then amortized over the vesting period. See Note 7 to the Company's
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation.
 
Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
Market
Risk:
 
The
principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is
exposed are interest rates on cash and certain items in inventory.

Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures.
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
("Exchange Act")) that are designed to assure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and formsof the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
 
As
required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, under the supervision
and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. This is in accordance with Section 404(a)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") because the Company is a smaller reporting company under the SEC's rules. We
are not required to be in compliance with SOX 404(b), which requires attestation by a company's independent auditors.
 
Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, and affected by the board of directors and management to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") including those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2012.  In
order to assist in the testing of our internal controls, the Company engaged a third- party to assist in the testing and evaluation
of our internal control systems.
 
This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's current independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's current independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this
Annual Report.
 
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The
following is a brief account of the business experience of the Company's Directors and executive officers:
 
John
W. Gildea is the founding principal of Gildea Management Co., a management company of special situations with middle market
companies in the United States and Central Europe. From 2000 to 2003, Gildea Management Co. formed a joint venture with J.O. Hambro
Capital Management Co. to manage accounts targeting high yield debt and small capitalization equities. From 1996 to 2000, Gildea
Management Co. formed and founded Latona Europe, a joint venture between Latona U.S., Lazard Co. and Gildea Management Co. to restructure
several Czech Republic companies. Before forming Gildea Management Co. in 1990, Mr. Gildea managed the Corporate Series Group
at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, an investment banking firm. Mr. Gildea is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh.
 
Mr.
Gildea has extensive experience as an international investment banker and sits on the Board of several companies. The Board believes
this experience qualifies him to serve as a director.

Item 11. Executive
Compensation.
 
Compensation
Discussion and Analysis
 
Overview
of Compensation Program and Philosophy
 
Our
compensation program is intended to:
 

•Attract, motivate, retain and reward employees of outstanding ability;
 

•Link changes in employee compensation to individual and corporate performance;
 

•Align employees' interests with those of the Company's shareholders.
 
The
ultimate objective of our compensation program is to increase shareholder value. We seek to achieve these objectives with a total
compensation approach which takes into account a competitive base salary, bonus pay based on the annual performance of the Company
and individual goals and stock option awards.
 
Base
Salaries
 
Base
salaries paid to executives are intended to attract and retain highly talented individuals. In setting base salaries, individual
experience, individual performance, the Company's performance and job responsibilities during the year are considered. Executive
salaries are reconciled by Human Resources and evaluated against local companies of similar size and nature.
 
Annual
Bonus Plan Compensation
 
The
Compensation Committee of the Board approves annual performance-based compensation. The purpose of the annual bonus-based compensation
is to motivate executive officers and key employees. Target bonuses, based upon recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer,
are evaluated and approved by the Compensation Committee for all management employees other than the Chief Executive Officer. The
bonus recommendations are derived from individual and Company performance but not based on a specific formula and are discretionary.
The Chief Executive Officer's bonus compensation is derived from the recommendation of the Compensation Committee based upon the
Chief Executive Officer's performance and Company performance but is not based on a specific formula and is discretionary.
 
Stock
Option Awards
 
Stock
option awards are intended to attract and retain highly talented executives, to provide an opportunity for significant compensation
when overall Company performance is reflected in the stock price and to help align executives' and shareholders' interests. Stock
options are typically granted at the time of hire to key new employees and annually to a broad group of existing key employees,
including executive officers.
 
Annual
option grants to executive officers are made in the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs") to the fullest extent permitted
under tax laws, with the balance granted in the form of nonqualified stock options. ISOs have potential income tax advantage for
executives if the executive disposes of the acquired shares after satisfying certain holding periods. Tax laws provide that the
aggregate grant at date of grant for market value of ISOs that become exercisable for any employee in any year may not exceed $100,000.
 
Our
current standard vesting schedule for all employees is 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, 50% on the second anniversary
of the date of grant, 75% on the third anniversary of the date of grant and 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
 
401
(k) Plan
 
Our
Individual Deferred Tax and Savings Plan (the "401 (k) plan") is a tax qualified retirement savings plan pursuant
to which all of the Company's U.S. employees may defer compensation under Section 401 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company contributes an amount equal to 10% of salary contributed under the 401
(k) plan by an eligible employee, up to the maximum allowed under the Code. We do not provide any supplemental retirement
benefits to executive officers.
 

28
 

 
Change
in Control benefits
 
Change
in control benefits are intended to diminish the distraction that executives would face by virtue of the personal uncertainties
created by a pending or threatened change in control and to assure that the Company will continue to have the executive's full
attention and services at all time. Our change in control benefits are designed to be competitive with similar benefits available
at companies with which we compete for executives' talent. These benefits, as one element of our total compensation program, help
the Company attract, retain and motivate highly talented executives.
  

Mr. McManus is entitled to severance pay and benefits if
he terminates his employment with the Company following a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), to
provide him with an incentive to remain with the Company and consummate a strategic corporate sale or transaction that
maximizes shareholder value. Severance pay and benefits are triggered upon (i) his Involuntary Termination without Cause (as
defined in the Employment Agreement) for a reason other than death or Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or
(ii) as a result of a Constructive Termination (as defined in the Employment Agreement) which in either case occurs: (x)
during the period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months after the effective date of a Change in Control, or (y) before the
effective date of a Change in Control, but after the first date on which the Board and/or senior management of the Company
has entered into formal negotiations with a potential acquirer that results in the consummation of a Change in Control.
 
In the event that pay and benefits are triggered, Mr.
McManus (A) is entitled to receive severance pay in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (a) his annual base pay and
(b) bonus at the highest rate paid him for any fiscal year during the aggregate period of his employment by the Company,
payable in cash in a lump sum; and the payment of premiums for medical, dental, vision, hospitalization and long term care
coverage under Company plans for a period of twenty-four (24) months; (B) has the right, for a period of (i) ninety (90) days
for stock options granted under any of the Company’s Employee Stock Option Plans adopted prior to 2005 and (ii) two (2)
years for stock options granted under the Company’s 2005 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, 2009 Employee Equity Incentive
Plan and any Plan adopted after the effective date of the
Employment Agreement following his Termination Date (as defined in the
Employment Agreement), to exercise the options to the extent such options are otherwise vested and exercisable as of the
Termination Date under the terms of the applicable stock option agreement(s) and Plan(s); and (C) will vest in all unvested
stock option grants with respect to options granted after July 1, 2012.

 
Mr. Zaremba
and Mr. Ryan have an agreement for the payment of twelve months of annual base salary upon a change in control of the Company.
 
Tax
deductibility of Executive Compensation
 
Section 162
(m) of the Code limits to $1,000,000 per person the amount that we may deduct for compensation paid to any of our most highly
compensated officers in any year. In fiscal 2012, there was no executive officer's compensation that exceeded $1,000,000.
 
The
following table sets forth information concerning the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our named executive officers
during the past two fiscal years for services rendered to the Company:

Employment
Agreements
 

On June 30, 2012, the Employment Agreement, dated July 13, 2009,
as amended (as so amended, the “2009 Agreement”), by and between Michael A. McManus, Jr. and the Company expired pursuant
to a timely notice of non-renewal delivered to the Company by Mr. McManus. Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Mr. McManus was employed
by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
On September 11, 2012, the Company entered into a new Employment
Agreement with Michael A. McManus, Jr., whereby he will continue to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive
Officer (the “Employment Agreement”). The Employment Agreement, effective as of July 1, 2012, has an initial term expiring
June 30, 2013 and renews for successive one-year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party not less than ninety (90)
days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $283,250, a company-provided
automobile and an annual bonus based on Mr. McManus’ achievement of annual goals and objectives as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board.
 
Mr. McManus is entitled under the Employment Agreement to participate
in any plans and programs made available to the executive employees of the Company generally.
 
The Company can terminate the Employment Agreement for cause
(as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. McManus can terminate the Employment Agreement for good reason (as defined in the
Employment Agreement). If Mr. McManus terminates the Employment Agreement for good reason, the Company must pay him an amount equal
to two times his total compensation (annual base salary plus bonus) at the highest rate paid him at any time during the aggregate
time he has been employed by the Company, payable in a lump sum within sixty (60) days of termination of employment.
 
The
Company and Mr. McManus have entered into two letter agreements providing for the exercise of vested options by Mr. McManus
(i) for a ninety (90) day period after his retirement with respect to stock options granted under certain of the
Company’s stock option plans and (ii) for two (2) years after Mr. McManus terminates his employment with the Company
in the event of a Change-in-Control (as defined in the applicable stock option plans) and he is eligible for the severance
benefits provided for by the Employment Agreement. 

 
In
conformity with the Company's policy, all officers and employees have executed a non-solicitation and confidentiality agreement.
The agreements generally provide that all inventions or discoveries by the employee related to the Company's business and all confidential
information developed or made known to the employee during the term of employment shall be the exclusive property of the Company
and shall not be disclosed to third parties without the prior approval of the Company. The Employment Agreement also contains non-competition provisions that preclude him from competing with the Company for a period of 18 months
from the date of his termination of employment.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
Board
of Directors and Stockholders
 
MISONIX,
INC. and Subsidiaries
 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MISONIX, INC. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30,
2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of MISONIX, INC. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
For
the two years ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011
  
Laboratory
and Forensic Safety Products Business
 
On
October 19, 2011, Misonix sold its Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business, which comprised substantially all of the Laboratory
and Scientific Products segment, to Mystaire, Inc. (“Mystaire”) for $1.5 million in cash plus a potential additional
payment of up to an aggregate $500,000 based upon 30% of net sales in excess of $2.0 million for each of the three years following
the closing (the “earn-out”). The Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business manufactured and marketed ductless
fume, laminar airflow and polymerase chain reaction workstations both domestically and internationally with revenues for fiscal
2011 of approximately $2.1 million.
 
In
accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Mystaire, Misonix retained among other items, the existing accounts receivable,
inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business. After considering the
proceeds received of $1,500,000 in cash, professional fees of $25,000 in connection with the sale and the net book value of the
assets sold of $24,000, which wascomprised primarily of property and equipment, Misonix reported a gain on sale of $1,451,000 and
recorded income taxes of $242,000 on the gain during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The earn-out will not be factored into
the gain on sale until it is earned by Misonix.
 
In
accordance with the terms of the Transition and Manufacturing Services Agreement with Mystaire, which was entered into as part
of the sale, Misonix continued for a period of six weeks to manufacture and deliver products for orders received prior to the closing
date as well as to provide product to Mystaire as transition inventory, which transition period was completed on November 30, 2011.

MISONIX,

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
For
the two years ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011
 
The
results of operations of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business will be presented as discontinued operations for
all periods presented as Misonix does not have any significant cash flow or continuing involvement in this business. Following
the sale of the Laboratory and Forensic Safety Products business, the Company operates in one reportable segment, Medical Devices.
 
High
Intensity Focused Ultrasound Technology
 
During
the year ended June 30, 2012 the Company received $254,788 related to and earn-out from the May 2010 sale of its rights to the
High Intensity focused Ultrasound (“HIFU”) technology to USHIFU, LLC (“USHIFU”), which has been recorded
as a component of gain on the sale of discontinued operation during the period.
 
In
consideration for the sale, Misonix will receive up to approximately $5.8 million, paid out of an earn-out of 7% of gross revenues
received by USHIFU related to the business being sold up to the time the Company has received the first $3 million and thereafter
5% of the gross revenues up to the $5.8 million. Commencing 90 days after each December 31st and beginning December 31, 2011, the
payment will be the greater of (a) $250,000 or (b) 7% of gross revenues receivedup to the time the Company has received the first
$3 million and thereafter 5% of gross revenues up to the $5.8 million.
 
Labcaire
Systems
 
On
August 4, 2009, the Company sold its Labcaire Systems, Ltd. ("Labcaire") subsidiary to PuriCore International Limited
("PuriCore Limited") for a total purchase price of up to $5.6 million. The Company received $3.6 million at closing and
a promissory note in the principal amount of $1 million, payable in equal installments of $250,000 on the next four anniversaries
of the closing. During the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company received the first installment. The note receivable was discounted
over the four years using a 4% imputed interest rate. This rate was consistent with published discounts. The discounted value of
the note ($900,000) was used to determine gain or loss on the sale and the remaining outstanding balance is included in other assets
in the consolidated balance sheet, with the current portion reflected as a component of notes receivable. The Company was also
to receive a commission paid on sales for the period commencing on the date of closing and ending on December 31, 2013 of 8% of
the pass through Automated Endoscope Reprocessing ("AER") and Drying Cabinet products, and 5% of license fees from any
chemical licenses marketed by Labcaire directly associated with sale of AERs, specifically for the disinfection of the endoscope.
The aggregate commission payable to the Company was also to be subject to a maximum payment of $1 million. The aggregate commission
was not recognized in determining the gain or loss on the sale of Labcaire until the commission was to be paid. As of June 30,
2011, there were no commissions paid. For the year ended June 30, 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of Labcaire
of $295,879. Results of Labcaire operations have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
 
In
January 2011, PuriCore Limited initiated a lawsuit against the Company in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial
Court, Royal Courts of Justice, London, England (Claim No. 2011-42) (the "Lawsuit"). In the Lawsuit, PuriCore Limited
claimed damages from the Company in respect of breach of warranties contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated August 4,
2009 (the "SPA"), pursuant to which the Company sold Labcaire to PuriCore Limited. PuriCore Limited claimed damages of
£2,167,000 or approximately $3,600,000, plus interest and its legal costs. The Company denied the allegations contained in
the Lawsuit.
 
On
July 19, 2011, PuriCore Limited and the Company reached an agreement to settle the Lawsuit (the "Settlement").
The Settlement provides that the Company (i) forgive in full PuriCore Limited and PuriCore plc's obligation under the SPA to
pay up to $1 million of the previously unrecorded, contingent commissions (as described above); (ii) pay PuriCore, Inc.
("PuriCore"), an affiliate of PuriCore Limited, $650,000 towards PuriCore Limited's legal costs which had been
accrued for as of June 30, 2011 and recorded as a component of loss from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30,
2011 and (iii) enter into a Product License and Distribution Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2011, with PuriCore
(the "Distribution Agreement").
 
Pursuant
to the Distribution Agreement, the Company has been granted the right to distribute PuriCore's Vashe®solution products
in the United States, on a private label basis, as an irrigating solution for the treatment of human wound care in conjunction
with therapeutic ultrasonic procedures (the "Field"). PuriCore has agreed, subject to modification, not to sell the products
that are the subject of the Distribution Agreement (the "Licensed Products") to any other therapeutic ultrasound company
for distribution in the Field in the United States ("Exclusivity"). The Company has agreed not to sell or distribute
in the United States in the Field any irrigating solution that has anti-microbial properties other than the Licensed Products so
long as the Company has Exclusivity.
 
The
Distribution Agreement is for a three (3) year term with automatic renewals for successive two (2) year periods; provided that
the Company and PuriCore have agreed upon sales volume targets for each renewal period (such volume targets not to increase by
more than ten (10%) percent year over year unless otherwise agreed) and provided that the cost terms shall be no less favorable
than the twelve (12) months leading up to the start of such renewal period. In no event will the Distribution Agreement survive
beyond the expiration or invalidation of all of PuriCore's patents.
 
During
the initial term of the Distribution Agreement, the Company is obligated to either purchase or pay a minimum of $2 million in
gross margin value to PuriCore for the Licensed Products (the "Minimum Payment"). The Minimum Payment is subject to
downward adjustment and elimination in the event that (i) PuriCore chooses to eliminate Exclusivity, (ii) the
Company's right to manufacture the Licensed Products under certain conditions has been triggered but the Company is unable to
manufacture the Licensed Products or to have the Licensed Products manufactured for it by third parties or (iii) the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration has made a final determination that prohibits the sale of the licensed products for use in
the Field. As of June 30, 2012, Misonix has incurred approximately $321,750 towards the Minimum Payment, leaving a Minimum
Payment balance of $1,678,250. At the start of fiscal 2012, the discounted value of the note was $650,000. During fiscal
2012, Misonix has purchased $451,883 of Licensed Products from Puricore, which has been offset against the note, leaving a
note receivable balance of $298,117.
 
The
Company has the right to manufacture the Licensed Products if PuriCore is unable to meet certain performance standards and
will pay PuriCore a royalty after the $2 million in gross margin value requirement has been satisfied if the Company is then
manufacturing the Licensed Products.
 
During
a renewal period, PuriCore may terminate the Distribution Agreement (i) if the Company fails to purchase the agreed upon volume
target for such renewal period and does not cure such failure in accordance with the Distribution Agreement or (ii) upon twelve
(12) months’ notice.

Reclassification
 
Certain
prior period amounts in the accompanying financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the current
period's presentation.
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 
The
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 
The
Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. At June 30, 2012, these financial institutions held cash
that was approximately $6,034,000 in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other government
agencies.
 
Major
Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Included
in sales from continuing operations are sales to Covidien Ltd. (“Covidien”) of $1,484,000 and $3,260,000, Aesculap,
Inc. (“Aesculap”) of $1,533,000 and $859,000, and Mentor (a Johnson & Johnson Company) of $1,492,000 and $900,000
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Total royalties from Covidien related to their sales of the
Company's ultrasonic cutting product, which uses high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic
surgery, were approximately $488,000 and $550,000 during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Accounts
receivable from Covidien were approximately $586,000 and $413,000, from Aesculap were approximately $532,000 and $6,300 and from
Mentor were approximately $385,000 and $171,000 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At June 30, 2012 and 2011, the
Company's accounts receivable with customers outside the United States were approximately $700,000 and $674,000, respectively.
 
Accounts
Receivable
 
Accounts
receivable, principally trade, are generally due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers, net of
an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and adjusts credit limits based upon payment
history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. The Company
continuously monitors aging reports, collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. While such credit losses
have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that the same credit loss
rates will be experienced in the future. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.

Inventories
 
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods.
Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairments of inventory on a quarterly basis. The Company's policy is
to assess the valuation of all inventories, including raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Inventory items used for
demonstration purposes, rentals or on consignment are classified in property, plant and equipment.
 
Property,
Plant and Equipment
 
Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Minor replacements and maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to
5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life of the related asset, whichever
is shorter. The Company's policy is to periodically evaluate the appropriateness of the lives assigned to property, plant and equipment
and make adjustments if necessary. Inventory items included in property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight
line method over estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years.
 
Revenue
Recognition
 
The
Company records revenue upon shipment for products shipped F.O.B. shipping point. Products shipped F.O.B. destination point are
recorded as revenue when received at the point of destination. Shipments under agreements with distributors are not subject to
return, and payment for these shipments is not contingent on sales by the distributor. Accordingly the Company recognizes revenue
on shipments to distributors in the same manner as with other customers. Fees from exclusive license agreements are recognized
ratably over the terms of the respective agreements. Service contracts and royalty income are recognized when earned. 
 
The
Company currently presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities in the statement of operations
on a net basis.
 
Long-Lived
Assets
 
The
carrying values of intangible and other long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment
indicators are present. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not
be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization and depreciation period, their
carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits,
an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit, adverse legal or regulatory developments, accumulation of costs
significantly in excess of amounts originally expected to acquire the asset and a material decrease in the fair value of some or
all of the assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent
of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. No such impairment existed at June 30, 2012 and 2011.
 
Goodwill
  
Goodwill
is not amortized. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of
an asset may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal
factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of significant assets or products. Application of
these impairment tests requires significant judgments, including estimation of cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts,
estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the Company’s business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and
determination of the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital. We primarily utilize a discontinued cash flow model in determining
the fair value, which consists of Level 3 inputs. Changes in the projected cash flows and discount rate estimates and assumptions
underlying the valuation of goodwill could materially affect the determination of fair value at acquisition or during subsequent
periods when tested for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal 2012 and 2011 in the
respective fourth quarter. No impairment of goodwill was deemed to exist.

Intangible
and Other Assets
 
The
cost of acquiring or processing patents is capitalized at cost. This amount is being amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, which is approximately 17 years. Net patents reported in intangible and
other assets totaled $561,507 and $548,016 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Accumulated amortization totaled $479,517
and $420,359 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011
was approximately $59,000 and $65,000, respectively.
 
On
October 7, 2010, the Company, F-S and Aesculap entered into a Termination, Amendment and Buy-Back Agreement to Distributor
Agreement (the "Termination Agreement"). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed to terminate, as of
October 15, 2010 (the "Termination Date"), (i) Misonix's remaining obligations under the Distributor Agreement
dated November 1999 between Aesculap and F-S, as amended (the "Distributor Agreement"), and (ii) Aesculap's rights
to sell procedure packs (the "Sale Rights") to the Sonastar Customers (as defined below). On the Termination Date, in
consideration of the purchase and sale of (i) Aesculap's current service contracts ("Sonastar Contracts") for the
products (the "Products") that are the subject of the Distributor Agreement, customer list and customers currently evaluating
the Products all with respect to the sale and servicing of the Products (the "Customer List") and (ii) the Sale
Rights, Misonix paid Aesculap $800,000. Misonix assumed all rights, responsibilities and obligations pursuant to and under the
(i) Sonastar Contracts and Customer List and (ii) the Sale Rights, including, without limitation, the sale of accessory
Products and servicing and training of the Products to the customers with Sonastar Contracts (the "Sonastar Customers").
Misonix also agreed to repurchase from Aesculap the current inventory of (i) new Products held by Aesculap at the price Aesculap
paid for such Products and (ii) used Products held by Aesculap for demonstration and/or loaner purposes at prices equal to
Aesculap's book-value as of July 31, 2010 for such Products. The purchase price for the current inventory acquired was $519,000.
Aesculap also agreed to certain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for an eighteen (18) month period.
 
The
Company has determined that the acquisition did not constitute a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations.” Accordingly, it has
been recorded as an asset acquisition with the aggregate cost of $1,319,000 assigned to the assets acquired based upon their relative
fair values. The Company has allocated $259,000 of the cost to inventory, $260,000 of the cost to equipment which will be amortized
over a three year period on a straight-line basis and $800,000 to customer relationships which will be amortized on a straight-line
basis over a five year period.
 
Net
customer relationships reported in intangible and other assets totaled $520,000 and $680,000 at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011,
respectively. Accumulated amortization amounted to $280,000 and $120,000 at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively. Amortization
expenses for the years ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 were $160,000 and $120,000, respectively.

Income
Taxes
 
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible.  Should
management determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax asset would be established in the period such determination was made.
 
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies income tax related interest and penalties as a component of
income tax expense.

Income
(Loss) Per Share
 
Basic
income (loss) per common share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per common share ("Diluted EPS") is computed by dividing
income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and the dilutive common share equivalents and convertible securities
then outstanding.
 
Excluded
from the calculation of Diluted EPS are options to purchase 1,408,030 shares of common stock for the three months ended June 30,
2012. The excluded shares are any shares in which the average stock price for the quarter or year-to-date is less than the exercise
price of the outstanding options in the period in which the Company has net income.
 
Diluted
EPS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012 and the twelve and the unaudited three months ended June 30, 2011 presented is the
same as Basic EPS, as the inclusion of the effect of common share equivalents then outstanding would be anti-dilutive. For this
reason, excluded from the calculations of Diluted EPS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012 and twelve and the unaudited three
months ended June 30, 2011 are outstanding options to purchase 1,820,930 and 1,795,415 shares, respectively.

Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
 
In
December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts,
to modify goodwill impairment testing for reporting units with a zero or negative carrying amount. Under the amended guidance,
an entity must consider whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists for reporting units with a zero or
negative carrying amount. If it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, the second step of the goodwill impairment
test in ASC 350-20-35 must be performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. This standard was effective
for goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2010, and became effective
for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning July 1, 2011. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principlesand International Financial Reporting Standards. This guidance amends U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in U.S.
GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, and they include those that clarify
the FASB's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a
particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. In addition,
to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions, some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that U.S.  GAAP
and IFRS fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way. This amended guidance is to be applied
prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company is evaluating the guidance and does
not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
In
June 2011, the FASB amended Accounting Standard Codification 220, Comprehensive Income.  The amendment eliminates
the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.  In
accordance with the amendment, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income,
and the components of other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive statements.  Additionally,
reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income will be presented on the face of the financial statements.  The
amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which for the Company is July 1, 2012, with
full retrospective application required.  As a result, the adoption of this standard will change how we present other
comprehensive income (loss), which has been historically presented as part of our consolidated statements of stockholders’
equity.
 
In
September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards UpdateNo. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. Under the revised
guidance, companies testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the
fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test). If companies determine, on the basis of qualitative
factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment
test would be required. This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the revised guidance and does not anticipate
that adoption will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
We
follow a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to
maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of "unobservable inputs." The three levels of
inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
 
Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date.
 
Level
2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
 
Level
3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
to estimate that value:
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 
The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
 
Trade
Accounts Receivable
 
The
carrying amount of trade receivables reflects net recovery value and approximates fair value because of their short outstanding
terms.
 
Trade
Accounts Payable
 
The
carrying amount of trade payables approximates fair value because of their short outstanding terms.
 
Note
Receivable
 
The
carrying amount of the note receivable approximates fair value because the discount rate is fair market value.

Misonix
has entered into several noncancellable operating leases for the rental of certain manufacturing and office space, equipment and
automobiles expiring in various years through 2017. The principal building lease provides for a monthly rental amount of approximately
$23,000. The Company also leases certain office equipment and automobiles under operating leases expiring through fiscal 2017.
 
The
following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments, by year and in the aggregate, under operating leases with initial or
remaining terms of one year or more at June 30, 2012:

Stock-Based Compensation Plans
 
Stock
options are granted with exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grant, with
an exercise term as determined by the Committee administering the applicable option plan (the "Committee") not to exceed
10 years. The Committee determines the vesting period for the Company's stock options. Generally, such stock options have
vesting periods of immediate to four years. Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting upon meeting specific retirement,
death or disability criteria, and upon change of control. During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company granted
options to purchase 233,750 and 294,500 shares of the Company's common stock, respectively.
 
Compensation
expense is recognized in the general and administrative expenses line item of the Company's statements of operations on a straight-line
basis over the vesting periods. There are no capitalized stock-based compensation costs at June 30, 2012 and 2011. As of June 30,
2012, there was approximately $698,820 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

Cash
received from the exercise of stock options for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $3,187 and $0, respectively. Cash
flows from tax benefits attributable to tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess
tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows.
 
The
weighted average fair value at date of grant for options granted during the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $1.75 and $1.61
per share, respectively. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
utilizing the following assumptions:
 


  
2012  
2011 

Risk-free interest rates 
 3.4% 
 4.1%

Expected option life in years 
 6.5  
 6.5 

Expected stock price volatility 
 75.44% 
 77.88%

Expected dividend yield 
 0% 
 0%

 
The
risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected option term is based upon
the number of years the company estimates the option will be outstanding. The expected dividend yield is based upon historical
and projected dividends. The Company estimates volatility based upon historical price changes of the Company’s stock over
a period equal to that of the expected life of the option.

Commitments and Contingencies
 
Employment
Agreement
 

On June 30, 2012, the Employment Agreement, dated July 13, 2009,
as amended (as so amended, the “2009 Agreement”), by and between Michael A. McManus, Jr. and the Company expired pursuant
to a timely notice of non-renewal delivered to the Company by Mr. McManus. Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Mr. McManus was employed
by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
On September 11, 2012, the Company entered into a new Employment
Agreement with Michael A. McManus, Jr., whereby he will continue to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive
Officer (the “Employment Agreement”). The Employment Agreement, effective as of July 1, 2012, has an initial term expiring
June 30, 2013 and renews for successive one-year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party not less than ninety (90)
days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $283,250, a company-provided
automobile and an annual bonus based on Mr. McManus’ achievement of annual goals and objectives as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board.
 
Mr. McManus is entitled under the Employment Agreement to participate
in any plans and programs made available to the executive employees of the Company generally.
 
The Company can terminate the Employment Agreement for cause
(as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. McManus can terminate the Employment Agreement for good reason (as defined in the
Employment Agreement). If Mr. McManus terminates the Employment Agreement for good reason, the Company must pay him an amount equal
to two times his total compensation (annual base salary plus bonus) at the highest rate paid him at any time during the aggregate
time he has been employed by the Company, payable in a lump sum within sixty (60) days of termination of employment.
 
Mr. McManus is entitled to severance pay and benefits if
he terminates his employment with the Company following a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), to
provide him with an incentive to remain with the Company and consummate a strategic corporate sale or transaction that
maximizes shareholder value. Severance pay and benefits are triggered upon (i) his Involuntary Termination without Cause (as
defined in the Employment Agreement) for a reason other than death or Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or
(ii) as a result of a Constructive Termination (as defined in the Employment Agreement) which in either case occurs: (x)
during the period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months after the effective date of a Change in Control, or (y) before the
effective date of a Change in Control, but after the first date on which the Board and/or senior management of the Company
has entered into formal negotiations with a potential acquirer that results in the consummation of a Change in Control.
 
In the event that pay and benefits are triggered, Mr.
McManus (A) is entitled to receive severance pay in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (a) his annual base pay and
(b) bonus at the highest rate paid him for any fiscal year during the aggregate period of his employment by the Company,
payable in cash in a lump sum; and the payment of premiums for medical, dental, vision, hospitalization and long term care
coverage under Company plans for a period of twenty-four (24) months; (B) has the right, for a period of (i) ninety (90) days
for stock options granted under any of the Company’s Employee Stock Option Plans adopted prior to 2005 and (ii) two (2)
years for stock options granted under the Company’s 2005 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, 2009 Employee Equity Incentive
Plan and any Plan adopted after the effective date of the Agreement following his Termination Date (as defined in the
Agreement), to exercise the options to the extent such options are otherwise vested and exercisable as of the Termination
Date under the terms of the applicable stock option agreement(s) and Plan(s); and (C) will vest in all unvested stock option
grants with respect to options granted after July 1, 2012.


 
The Company and Mr. McManus have entered into two letter
agreements providing for the exercise of vested options by Mr. McManus (i) for a ninety (90) day period after his retirement
with respect to stock options granted under certain of the Company’s stock option plans and (ii) for two (2) years
after Mr. McManus terminates his employment with the Company in the event of a Change-in-Control (as defined in the
applicable stock option plans) and he is eligible for the severance benefits provided for by the Employment Agreement.


 
Purchase
Commitments
 
As
of June 30, 2012 and 2011,the Company had inventory related purchase commitments totaling approximately $3,447,250 and $2,528,000,
respectively.
 
Contingencies
 
The
Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in ordinary and routine litigation.   Management presently
believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or result of operations. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties and an unfavorable ruling could occur.  An unfavorable ruling could include money damages and in such event,
could result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations in the year in which the ruling occurs.

Income Taxes
 
Open
tax years related to federal and state income tax filings are for the years ended June 30, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The
Company files state tax returns in New York and Colorado. The Company's foreign subsidiaries, Misonix Ltd. and Misonix Urology
Services Limited (formerly, UKHIFU Limited) filed tax returns in the United Kingdom. In general, open years related to the United
Kingdom for filing are June 30, 2010, 2011, and 2012. As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company has no material unrecognized tax
benefits and no accrued interest and penalties.
 
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
 
The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented
below:

As
of June 30, 2012, the valuation allowance was determined by estimating the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on these considerations, management concluded that
it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. The reduction in the valuation allowance is
primarily due to the gain from the sale of discontinued operations.

Licensing Agreements for Medical Technology
 
In
October 1996, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the "USS License") with United States Surgical (now,
Covidien) for a twenty-year period, covering the further development and commercial exploitation of the Company's medical technology
relating to ultrasonic cutting, which uses high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic
surgery.
 
The
USS License gives Covidien exclusive worldwide marketing and sales rights for this technology. Under the USS License, the Company
has received $475,000 in licensing fees (which are being recorded as income over the term of the USS License), plus royalties based
upon net sales of such products. Total royalties from sales of this device were approximately $488,000 and $550,000 for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
12.
Employee Profit Sharing Plan
 
The
Company sponsors a retirement plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code for all full time employees. Participants may contribute
a percentage of compensation not to exceed the maximum allowed under the Code, which was $17,000 or $22,500 if the employee was
over 50 years of age for the year ended June 30, 2012. The plan provides for a matching contribution by the Company of
10% of annual eligible compensation contributed by the participants based on years of service, which amounted to $41,964 and $42,186
for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
