  PART I     
 
    Item 1.    Business     
 Overview  
        We are the third largest retail drugstore chain in the United States based on revenues and number of stores. We operate our drugstores
in 31 states across the country and in the District of Columbia. As of March 3, 2012, we operated 4,667 stores. 
        In
our stores, we sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of other merchandise, which we call "front end" products. In fiscal 2012, prescription drug sales accounted for 68.1% of
our total sales. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a significant part of our business due to favorable industry trends, including an aging population, increased life
expectancy, anticipated growth in the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program as "baby boomers" start to enroll, expanded coverage for uninsured Americans as the result of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the discovery of new and better drug therapies. We carry a full assortment of front end products, which accounted for the remaining 31.9% of our total
sales in fiscal 2012. Front end products include over-the-counter medications, health and beauty aids, personal care items, cosmetics, household items, beverages, convenience
foods, greeting cards, seasonal merchandise and numerous other everyday and convenience products, as well as photo processing. We attempt to distinguish our stores from other national chain
drugstores, in part, through our wellness + loyalty program, private brands and our strategic alliance with GNC, a leading retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements. We offer a wide
variety of products under our private brands, which contributed approximately 17.0% and 16.0% of our front end sales in the categories where private brand products were offered in fiscal 2012 and
fiscal 2011, respectively. 
        The
overall average size of each store in our chain is approximately 12,600 square feet. The average size of our stores is larger in the western United States. As of March 3,
2012, 60% of our stores were freestanding; 51% of our stores included a drive-thru pharmacy; 24% included
one-hour photo shops; and 46% included a GNC store-within-Rite Aid-store. 
        Our
headquarters are located at 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, and our telephone number is (717) 761-2633. Our common stock is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the trading symbol of "RAD." We were incorporated in 1968 and are a Delaware corporation. 
 Industry Trends  
        The rate of pharmacy sales growth in the United States in recent years has slowed, driven by the decline in new blockbuster drugs, a
longer FDA approval process, drug safety concerns, higher copays, the loss of individual health insurance with the rise of unemployment and an increase in the use of generic (non-brand
name) drugs, which are less expensive but generate higher gross margins. However, we expect prescription sales to grow in the coming years due to the aging population, increased life expectancy, "baby
boomers" becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare prescription program and new drug therapies. Furthermore, we expect the estimated additional 33 million people who will be covered
by health insurance in 2014, and the closing of the "donut hole" in Medicare Part D to be good for our business. 
        Generic
prescription drugs help lower overall costs for customers and third party payors. We believe the utilization of existing generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase.
Further, a significant number of new generics are expected to be introduced in 2012 and 2013 as many popular branded drugs are scheduled to lose patent protection. The gross profit from a generic drug
prescription in the retail drugstore industry is greater than the gross profit from a brand drug prescription, however, the sale amount can be substantially less.

Table of Contents
        The
retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and has been experiencing consolidation. We believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry, continued new store
openings, increased competition from internet based providers and aggressive generic pricing programs at competitors such as Wal-Mart and various supermarket chains will further increase
competitive pressures in the industry. The pharmacy business has become increasingly promotional, which contributes to additional competitive pressures. 
        The
retail drugstore industry relies significantly on third party payors. Third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state sponsored Medicaid and related
managed care Medicaid agencies, at times change the eligibility requirements of participants or reduce certain reimbursement rates. These changes and reductions are expected to continue. When third
party payors, including the Medicare Part D program and state sponsored Medicaid agencies, reduce the number of participants and/or reduce their reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the
industry could be reduced, and profitability of the industry adversely affected. These possible adverse effects can be partially or entirely offset by controlling expenses, dispensing more higher
margin generics and dispensing more prescriptions overall. 
 Strategy  
        Our primary goal for fiscal 2013, consistent with fiscal 2012, is to grow same stores sales, which is critical for our future financial
success. Same store sales growth will enable us to take full advantage of the improvements that we have made in the areas of cost control and working capital management. We also plan to take advantage
of the costs savings and gross profit improvement opportunities that will result from the conversion of numerous brand drugs to generic alternatives in fiscal 2013 and beyond. We also plan to increase
our capital investment in our store base, which we expect to lead to additional sales growth. We expect these initiatives to lead to growth in long term shareholder value. Following is a description
of these initiatives: 
         wellness +We rolled out our wellness + loyalty program in April of 2010. wellness + is a free customer loyalty program
that provides benefits to enrolled members based on the accumulation of points for certain front end and prescription purchases. This program provides significant value to customers who achieve Gold,
Silver, and Bronze tier levels in the program and has been very well received by our customers. As of April 2012, we had over 52 million members enrolled in the
wellness + program. At the end of our fiscal year, wellness + members accounted for 74% of front end sales and 68% of prescriptions filled. wellness + members
have higher basket sizes than non-members and also have a much higher rate of prescription retention. wellness + members also are eligible to receive plus-up
rewards, which are discounts on certain items featured in our weekly circular and provide members with additional savings for return shopping trips. Beginning in January 2012, we added additional
features to the program, which include the creation of a Bronze member tier and the rollout of our Load2Card feature. The Bronze tier is achieved when a member reaches 250 points, Bronze tier members
receive 10% off on the purchase of all Rite Aid private brand merchandise and a one-time10% shopping pass. Load2Card is a new coupon management program and is the first of its kind in the
drugstore retailer space. It enables customers to save, manage and redeem Rite Aid and manufacturer coupons available throughout the internet via their wellness + card. Customers have
responded favorably to these enhancements. 
        We
believe that the wellness + program has contributed to the improvement in our fiscal 2012 sales trends. We plan on making additional incremental investments in
wellness + in fiscal 2013, primarily in additional discounts, as we expect more customers to move into the Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels. 
        Express Scripts customersAs of January 1, 2012, the Express Scripts pharmacy benefit management network decreased the number of participating
pharmacies. This has contributed to an 
5



 
Table of Contents
increase
in same store script volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. To the extent that the Express Scripts pharmacy benefit management network continues to exclude other pharmacies from their
network, we have the opportunity to pick up incremental share. We plan to work proactively to ensure that we attract and retain as many new customers as possible Efforts to do so will include
adjusting pharmacy staffing levels where appropriate, encouraging customers to sign up for wellness +, and continuing to communicate in print, signage and other advertising channels that we accept
Express Scripts pharmacy benefit management network patients. 
         Wellness remodelsDuring fiscal 2012, we introduced our new Wellness format store. These stores offer expanded clinical pharmacy services and new
health and wellness product offerings. They are staffed with our unique Wellness Ambassadors, who serve as an added customer resource and bridge from the front end of the stores to the pharmacy. We
completed 274 wellness remodels in fiscal 2012 and expect to complete an additional 500 in fiscal 2013. Our customers have responded favorably to this unique store format and recent sales results in
these stores have been encouraging. 
         Healthcare servicesDuring fiscal 2012, we increased the number of Rite Aid immunizing pharmacists to 11,000, expanded our immunization services to
all of our stores and administered 1.5 million flu shots. In addition to flu shots, we also expanded the scope of our immunization services to 14 different disease states. Continuing to expand
the volume and types of immunizations that we can perform will be an area of focus for fiscal 2013. In conjunction with Optum Health, last August we introduced NowClinic Online Care services inside
select Rite Aid pharmacies in the greater Detroit area. These clinics provide on-line access to a physician, who has the ability to diagnose and potentially write prescriptions for our
patients. We have also introduced wellness + for diabetes, the first extension of our wellness + program to provide discounts on front-end products and
resources for diabetes patients and caregivers. One such resource is "Diabetes Head2Toe", a unique collaboration with Web MD to provide online tools to help patients manage and live well with
diabetes.
We are focused on healthcare-related services because we believe these services will help build loyalty with existing customers and attract new ones. 
        Script file purchasesWe intend to increase the amount of capital allocated to the purchase of prescription files from $35.0 million in fiscal
2012 to $50.0 million in fiscal 2013. 
         Private brandsDuring fiscal 2011, we began the rollout of a new private brand architecture, which includes the consolidation of our private brands in
three separate tiers. We have converted about 2,900 items to the new architecture and have improved our private brand penetration by 100 basis points over the prior year. We expect to have
approximately 3,000 items in these brands in fiscal 2013. Many of the new items are in our price fighter brand, Simplify, and we believe customers have found these products to be of high quality and
provide great value. 
         Customer serviceWe have put programs in place in store operations to stress the importance of greeting our customers more frequently and assisting
them with their purchases. We made investments in technology in fiscal 2011 and 2012 that make it easier for our store associates to perform necessary tasks, such as price changes and backroom
inventory management, which will free up their time to focus on the customer. During fiscal 2012, we increased the amount of dollars spent on training our store and field associates on customer
service skills. We believe this additional focus has helped drive our same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 and this will continue to be an area of focus for us in fiscal 2013. 
        We
made significant reductions to our SG&A expense over the past few years through better control of store labor and other controllable costs in the stores, consolidation of our
distribution center network, a centralized indirect procurement function for all non-merchandise purchases and through initiatives aimed to simplify our processes in the stores and at our
Corporate office. We will continue to focus on controlling costs in fiscal 2013 so that we can maximize the benefits of our sales initiatives.

 Products and Services  
        Sales of prescription drugs represented approximately 68.1%, 67.8%, and 67.9% of our total sales in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. In fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, prescription drug sales were $17.7 billion, $17.0 billion, and $17.4 billion, respectively. See "Item 7 Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements. 
        We
carry a full assortment of non-prescription, or front end products. The types and number of front end products in each store vary, and selections are based on customer
needs and preferences and available space. No single front end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal 2012. Our principal classes of products in fiscal 2012 were the
following:

        We
offer a wide variety of products under our private brands, which contributed approximately 17.0% of our front end sales in the categories where private brand products were offered in
fiscal 2012. We intend to increase the number of private brand products during fiscal 2013, many of which will be in our price fighter brand, Simplify. We believe that our customers find these
products to be of high quality and provide great value. 
        We
have a strategic alliance with GNC under which we have opened over 2,100 GNC "stores-within-Rite Aid-stores" as of March 3, 2012 and a contractual
commitment to open additional stores by December 2014. We incorporate the GNC store-within-Rite Aid-store concept into many of our new and relocated stores and into many of our
Wellness remodels. GNC is a leading nationwide retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements, personal care, fitness and other health-related products. 
 Technology  
        All of our stores are integrated into a common information system, which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any
of our stores throughout the country, reduces chances of adverse drug interactions, and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently. This system can be expanded to
accommodate new stores. Our customers may also order prescription refills over the Internet through www.riteaid.com, or over the phone through our
telephonic automated refill systems for pick up at a Rite Aid store. We have automated pharmacy
dispensing units in high volume stores, which are linked to our pharmacists' computers that fill and label prescription drug orders. The efficiency of these units allows our pharmacists to spend more
time consulting with our customers. Additionally, each of our stores employs point-of-sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends. This same
point-of-sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which, together with our sales analysis, drives our automated inventory replenishment
process. 
        We
continue to embrace technology as a way to enhance the customer experience. We completed the development of our new mobile app, which is now available for download for both the
Android and iPhone platforms. This free app allows our customers to use their smartphones to order refills by scanning their prescription bottle, manage their wellness + account, access
the weekly circular to view sale items and locate a nearby Rite Aid store using GPS.

Table of Contents
 Suppliers  
        During fiscal 2012, we purchased brand pharmaceuticals and some generic pharmaceuticals, which amounted to approximately 90.9% of the
dollar volume of our prescription drugs, from a single wholesaler, McKesson Corp ("McKesson"), under a contract which runs through April 1, 2013. Under the contract, with limited exceptions, we
are required to purchase all of our branded pharmaceutical products from McKesson. If our relationship with McKesson was disrupted, we could temporarily have difficulty filling prescriptions for
brand-named drugs until we executed a replacement wholesaler agreement or developed and implemented self-distribution processes, which could negatively affect our business. 
        We
purchase most of our generic (non-brand name) pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers which account for approximately 76% of our prescription volume. We believe the
loss of any one generic supplier would not disrupt our ability to fill generic (non-brand name) prescriptions but could negatively impact our results. 
        We
purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of
the non-pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business. 
        We
sell private brand and co-branded products that generally are supplied by numerous competitive sources. The Rite Aid and GNC co-branded PharmAssure vitamin and
mineral supplement products and the GNC branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by GNC, and along with our Rite Aid brand vitamin and mineral
supplements, are manufactured by GNC. 
 Customers and Third Party Payors  
        During fiscal 2012, our stores filled approximately 295 million prescriptions and served an average of 2.1 million
customers per day. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
        In
fiscal 2012, 96.5% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third party payors (such as insurance companies, prescription benefit management companies, government agencies,
private employers or other managed care providers) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases based on negotiated and contracted reimbursement rates. During
fiscal 2012, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 66.4% of our pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor represented 22.9% of our pharmacy sales. 
        During
fiscal 2012, Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid payors sales were approximately 17.7% of our pharmacy sales, of which the largest single Medicaid payor was approximately
2.1% of our pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2012, approximately 28.2% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D. 
 Competition  
        The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive. We compete with, among others, retail drugstore chains, independently owned
drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, discount stores, dollar stores and mail order pharmacies. We compete on the basis of store location and convenient access, customer service, product
selection and price. We believe continued consolidation of the drugstore industry, the aggressive discounting of generic drugs by supermarkets and mass merchandisers and the increase of promotional
incentives to drive prescription sales will further increase competitive pressures in the industry.

Table of Contents 
 Marketing and Advertising  
        In fiscal 2012, marketing and advertising expense was approximately $369.4 million, which was spent primarily on weekly circular
advertising. Our marketing and advertising activities centered primarily on the following:


Product price promotions to draw customers to our stores; 
Our wellness + loyalty program, which benefits members based on accumulating points for certain front end
and prescription purchases, and offers + UP rewards to provide members additional savings; 
Our value plus concept pilot stores offer our customers specific shopping experiences and high value products in addition
to those found in a traditional drug store; 
Emphasis on the value of our private brand products; 
Support of specific initiatives and stores, including competitor market intrusion and prescription file buys; and  
Our vision to be the customer's first choice for health and wellness products, services and information. 

        Under
the umbrella of our "With Us It's Personal" brand positioning, we promote educational programs focusing on specific health conditions and incentives for patients to transfer their
prescriptions to Rite Aid. We are also emphasizing our automated courtesy refill service. We believe all of these programs will help us improve customer satisfaction and grow profitable sales. 
 Associates  
        We believe that our relationships with our associates are good. As of March 3, 2012, we had approximately 90,000 associates: 12%
were pharmacists, 43% were part-time and 26% were represented by unions. Associate satisfaction is critical to the success of our strategy. We have surveyed our associates to obtain
feedback on various employment-related topics, including job satisfaction and their understanding of our core values and mission. We have also instituted an internal group, consisting of managers and
staff from all components of our business that is responsible for using feedback from associates throughout the Company to create a better work environment. 
        The
pharmacist shortage has eased significantly. The increase in the number of graduates from U.S. Schools of Pharmacy is starting to meet the workforce demand. However, pharmacist
employment opportunities still exist in certain areas. 
 Research and Development  
        We do not make significant expenditures for research and development. 
 Licenses, Trademarks and Patents  
        The Rite Aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products.
We hold licenses to sell beer, wine and liquor, cigarettes and lottery tickets. As part of our strategic alliance with GNC, we have a license to operate GNC "stores-within-Rite
Aid-stores." We also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities. Collectively, these licenses are material to our operations.

Table of Contents
 Seasonality  
        We experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the
result of the concentration of the cough, cold and flu season and the holidays. We tailor certain front end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons. We increase our inventory levels during
our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above. Our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and
severity of the cough, cold and flu season, both of which are unpredictable. 
 Regulation  
        Our business is subject to federal, state, and local government laws, regulations and administrative practices. We must comply with
numerous provisions regulating health and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wage and licensing for the sale of drugs, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and other products. In addition we must
comply with regulations pertaining to product content, labeling, dating and pricing. 
        Pursuant
to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ("OBRA") and comparable state regulations, our pharmacists are required to offer counseling, without additional charge, to our
customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects and other information deemed significant by the pharmacists and may have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential
adverse effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate such effect. 
        The
appropriate state boards of pharmacy must license our pharmacies and pharmacists. Our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the Federal Drug Enforcement
Administration and are subject to Federal Drug Enforcement Agency regulations relative to our pharmacy operations, including regulations governing purchasing, storing and dispensing of controlled
substances. Applicable licensing and registration requirements require our compliance with various state statutes, rules and/or regulations. If we were to violate any applicable statute, rule or
regulation, our licenses and registrations could be suspended or revoked or we could be subject to fines or penalties. Any such violation could also damage our reputation and brand. 
        In
recent years, an increasing number of legislative proposals have been enacted (including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), introduced or proposed in Congress and in
some state legislatures that affect or would affect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. The legislative initiatives include changes in reimbursement
levels, changes in qualified participants, changes in drug safety regulations and e-prescribing. We cannot predict the timing of enactment of any such proposals to the extent not yet
approved or the long-term outcome or effect of legislation from these efforts on our business. 
        Our
pharmacy business is subject to patient privacy and other obligations, including corporate, pharmacy and associate responsibility imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act. As a covered entity, we are required to implement privacy standards, train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information, provide a notice of
privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information. Failure to properly
adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties. 
        We
are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our associates, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and unionizing efforts. Increases in the
federal minimum wage rate, associate benefit costs or other costs related to associates could adversely affect our results of operations. 
        In
addition, in connection with the ownership and operations of our stores, distribution centers and other sites, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment and 
10

health
and safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Violations or liabilities under these laws and
regulations as a result of our current or former operations or historical activities at our sites, such as gasoline service stations and dry cleaners, could result in significant costs. 
 Corporate Governance and Internet Address  
        We recognize that good corporate governance is an important means of protecting the interests of our stockholders, associates,
customers and the community. We have closely monitored and implemented relevant legislative and regulatory corporate governance reforms, including provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
("Sarbanes-Oxley"), the rules of the SEC interpreting and implementing Sarbanes-Oxley and the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. 
        Our
corporate governance information and materials, including our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation
Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, our Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Related Person
Transaction Policy are posted on the corporate governance section of our website at www.riteaid.com and are available in print upon request to Rite Aid

    Item 1A.    Risk Factors     
 Factors Affecting our Future Prospects  
        Set forth below is a description of certain risk factors which we believe may be relevant to an understanding of us and our business.
Security holders are cautioned that these and other factors may affect future performance and cause actual results to differ from those which may be anticipated. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements." 
 
 
  Risks Related to our Financial Condition     
 Current economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.  
        The United States economy is continuing to feel the impact of the economic downturn that began in late 2007, and the future economic
environment may not fully recover to levels prior to the downturn. This economic uncertainty has and could further lead to reduced consumer spending for the foreseeable future. If consumer spending
continues to decrease or does not recover, we may not be able to sustain the improvement in our same store sales. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to
offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. We operate a number of stores in areas that are experiencing a lower recovery than the economy
on a national level. A continued softening or slow recovery in consumer spending may adversely affect our industry, business
and results of operations. Reduced revenues as a result of decreased consumer spending may also reduce our liquidity and otherwise hinder our ability to implement our long term strategy.

 We are highly leveraged. Our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain
additional financing if necessary.  
        We had, as of March 3, 2012, $6.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders' deficit of $2.6 billion.
We also had additional borrowing capacity under our $1.175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility of approximately $910.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of
$128.2 million. Our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for fiscal 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 by $412.4 million, $564.8 million,
$498.4 million, $2.6 billion and $340.6 million, respectively. 
        Our
high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations. Among other things, our indebtedness will:


limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete;  
place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;  
render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; and  
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt. 

        Our
ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to substantially improve our operating performance, which will be subject
to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations. 
        We
believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal 2013 and have no
significant maturities prior to June 2014. However, if our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates rise significantly, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations or otherwise be required to delay our planned activities. If we are unable
to service our debt or experience a significant reduction in our liquidity, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and other initiatives, sell assets, restructure or
refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Further, any of these actions may not be sufficient
to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business. Our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate
sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or refinance our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are based upon variable rates of interest, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest
rates.  
        As of March 3, 2012, approximately $1.5 billion of our outstanding indebtedness bore interest at a rate that varies
depending upon the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). Borrowings under our Tranche 5 Term Loan due March 2018 are subject to a minimum LIBOR floor of 125 basis points. Our
Tranche 2 Term Loan due June 2014 and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility are most sensitive to LIBOR fluctuations because there is no floor. If LIBOR rises, the
interest rates on outstanding debt will increase. Therefore an increase in LIBOR would increase our interest payment obligations under those loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and
financial condition. We currently do not maintain hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest.

 The covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.  
        The covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness limit our ability
to:


incur debt and liens; 
pay dividends; 
make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock; 
make loans and investments; 
prepay, redeem or repurchase debt; 
engage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate
transactions; 
change our business; 
amend some of our debt and other material agreements; 
issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; 
restrict distributions from subsidiaries; and 
grant negative pledges to other creditors. 

        The
senior secured credit facility contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above, the payment of dividends, sale of
assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens. Our credit facility has a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenant requires
that, if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than $150.0 million, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.05 to 1.00. As of March 3, 2012, we had
availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately $910.8 million and were in compliance with the senior secured credit facility's financial covenant. 
 Our stockholders will experience dilution if we issue additional common stock.  
        Subject to any required approval under the stockholder agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement") that we entered into at the time of the
Brooks Eckerd acquisition, we are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common shares or preferred stock, including, subject to the terms of our outstanding debt instruments,
any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities, whether for cash, as
part of incentive compensation or in refinancing transactions. Any additional future issuances of common stock will reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by investors who do not participate
in such issuances. In most circumstances, stockholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as
a result of issuances of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur. 
 Subject to certain limitations, Jean Coutu Group may sell Rite Aid common stock at any time, which could cause our stock price to decrease.  
        The shares of Rite Aid common stock that the Jean Coutu Group currently holds are generally restricted, but Jean Coutu Group may sell
these shares under certain circumstances, including pursuant to a registered underwritten public offering under the Securities Act or in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. On
April 20, 2012, the Jean Coutu Group announced that it had disposed of 
13



 
Table of Contents
56,000,000
of its 234,401,162 shares of our common stock. We have entered into a registration rights agreement with Jean Coutu Group, which will give Jean Coutu Group the right to require us to
register all or a portion of its shares at any time (subject to certain exceptions). The sale of a substantial number of our shares by Jean Coutu Group or our other stockholders within a short period
of time could cause our stock price to decrease, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of Rite Aid common stock or acquire other businesses using Rite Aid common stock
as consideration. 
 We are in compliance with all New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements. However, if we do not continue to maintain compliance with such requirements, our
common stock may be delisted.  
        On March 1, 2011, we were notified by the NYSE that, as of March 1, 2011, we regained compliance with the NYSE minimum
share price listing requirement. We are now in compliance with all NYSE listing rules, have actively been taking steps to maintain our listing and expect our efforts to maintain our NYSE listing will
be successful. However, there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the NYSE minimum share price rule or other continued listing requirements. In the event of a delisting, all
holders of our $64.2 million of outstanding 8.5% Convertible Notes due May 2015 ("Convertible Notes") would be entitled to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes. Our senior secured
credit facility permits us to make such a repurchase of the Convertible Notes; provided that, before and after such transaction, no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing
under the senior secured credit facility and we have more than $100.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to pay cash to holders of the Convertible Notes
may be limited by our financial resources at the time of such repurchase. We cannot assure you that sufficient financing will be available on terms acceptable to us if necessary to make any required
repurchase of the Convertible Notes. 
 
 
  Risks Related to our Operations     
 We need to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition, but our operations will not improve if we cannot effectively implement our business strategy
or if our strategy is negatively affected by worsening economic conditions.  
        We have not yet achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors. We believe that improving the sales of existing stores
is important to improving profitability and operating cash flow. If we are not successful in implementing our strategies, including our efforts to increase sales and further reduce costs, or if our
strategies are not effective, we may not be able to improve our operations. In addition, any further adverse change or continued weakness in general economic conditions or major industries can
adversely affect drug benefit plans and reduce our pharmacy sales. Adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect consumer buying practices and consequently reduce our sales of front end
products, and cause a decrease in our profitability. Failure to improve operations or a continued weakness in major industries or general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt. 
 For so long as Jean Coutu Group (and, subject to certain conditions, certain members of the Coutu family) maintain certain levels of Rite Aid stock ownership, Jean Coutu
Group (and, subject to certain conditions, certain members of the Coutu family) could exercise significant influence over us.  
        At March 3, 2012, Jean Coutu Group owned approximately 25.2% of the voting power of Rite Aid. Jean Coutu Group (and, subject to
certain conditions, certain members of the Coutu family) generally has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. The Stockholder
Agreement provides that Jean Coutu Group (and, subject to certain conditions, certain members of the Coutu family) has the right to designate three of the eleven 
14



 
Table of Contents
members
of our board of directors, subject to adjustment based on its ownership position in us. On April 20, 2012, the Jean Coutu Group announced that it had disposed of 56,000,000 of its
234,401,162 shares of our common stock. As a result of such sale, the Jean Coutu Group was required to cause one of its designees to immediately resign from our board of directors and Andre
Belzile resigned from our board of directors effective April 23, 2012. Following Mr. Belzile's resignation and reduction of the size of our board of directors from eleven to ten members,
the Jean Coutu Group will continue to have the right to designate two members of our board of directors, subject to adjustment for future reductions in its ownership position in us. Accordingly, Jean
Coutu Group generally is, and is expected to continue to be, able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters that come before our board of directors. As a result of its significant interest
in us, Jean Coutu Group may have the power, subject to applicable law (including the fiduciary duties of the directors designated by Jean Coutu Group), to significantly influence actions that might be
favorable to Jean Coutu Group, but not necessarily favorable to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the ownership position and governance rights of Jean Coutu Group could
discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning us. 
 Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Jean Coutu Group, which may be resolved in a manner that adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of
operations.  
        Following the Brooks Eckerd acquisition, Jean Coutu Group has continued its Canadian operations but no longer has any operations in the
United States, and we currently have no operations in Canada. Despite the lack of geographic overlap, conflicts of interest may arise between us and Jean Coutu Group in areas relating to past, ongoing
and future relationships, including corporate opportunities, potential acquisitions or financing transactions, sales or other dispositions by Jean Coutu Group of its interests in us and the exercise
by Jean Coutu Group of its influence over our management and affairs. 
        A
number of the directors on our board of directors are persons who are also officers or directors of Jean Coutu Group or its subsidiaries. Service as a director or officer of both Rite
Aid and Jean Coutu Group or its other subsidiaries could create conflicts of interest if such directors or officers are faced with decisions that could have materially different implications for Rite
Aid and for Jean Coutu Group. Apart from the conflicts of interest policy contained in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and applicable to our directors, we and Jean Coutu Group have not
established any formal procedures for us and Jean Coutu Group to resolve potential or actual conflicts of interest between us. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing conflicts will be
resolved in a manner that does not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We are dependent on our management team, and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial
condition.  
        The success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team. The loss of key
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other
skilled personnel in the future.

 We are substantially dependent on a single wholesaler of branded pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms. A disruption in this relationship may
have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  
        We purchase all of our brand prescription drugs from a single wholesaler, McKesson, pursuant to a contract that runs through
April 1, 2013. Pharmacy sales represented approximately 68.1% of our total sales during fiscal 2012, and, therefore, our relationship with McKesson is important to us. Any significant
disruptions in our relationship with McKesson would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business until we executed a replacement wholesaler agreement or developed and implemented
self-distribution processes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find a replacement wholesaler on a timely basis or that such a wholesaler would be able to fulfill our
demands on similar terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, because McKesson acts as a wholesaler for drugs
purchased from ultimate manufacturers worldwide, any disruption in the supply of a given drug could adversely impact McKesson's ability to fulfill our demands, which would have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 A significant disruption in our computer systems or a cyber security breach could adversely affect our operations.  
        We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, inventory
replenishment and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism,
severe weather conditions, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or
otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical
functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal
and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. 
 
 
  Risks Related to our Industry     
 The markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.  
        We face intense competition with local, regional and national companies, including other drugstore chains, independently owned
drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Competition from discount stores and mail order has significantly increased during the past few years. Our industry
also faces growing competition from companies who import drugs directly from other countries, such as Canada, as well as from large-scale retailers that offer generic drugs at a substantial discount.
Some of our competitors have or may merge with or acquire pharmaceutical services companies or pharmacy benefit managers, which may further increase competition. We may not be able to effectively
compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours. In addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are
more highly leveraged than our competitors. The ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of loyal, repeat customers. We believe that the
continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in our
markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition.

 Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
        Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers, have consolidated or are in the process of
consolidating, such as the recent merger of Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has resulted in greater pricing
pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services.
If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue
streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare
industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 
 Drug benefit plan sponsors and third party payors could change their plan eligibility criteria and further encourage or require the use of mail-order prescriptions which
could decrease our sales and reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business.  
        An adverse trend for drugstore retailing has been initiatives to contain rising healthcare costs leading to the rapid growth in
mail-order prescription processors. These prescription distribution methods have grown in market share relative to drugstores as a result of the rapid rise in drug costs experienced in recent years
and are predicted to continue to rise. Mail-order prescription distribution methods are perceived by employers and insurers as being less costly than traditional distribution methods and are being
encouraged, and, in some cases, required, by third party pharmacy benefit managers, employers and unions that administer benefits. As a result, some labor unions and employers are requiring, and
others may encourage or require, that their members or employees obtain medications from mail-order pharmacies which offer drug prescriptions at prices lower than we are able to offer. 
        Another
adverse trend for drugstore retailing has been for drug benefit plan sponsors and third party payors to change their plan eligibility requirements resulting in fewer
beneficiaries covered and a reduction in the number of prescriptions allowed. 
        Mail-order
prescription distribution and drug benefit plan eligibility changes have negatively affected sales for traditional chain drug retailers, including us, and we expect such
negative effect to continue in the future. There can be no assurance that our efforts to offset the effects of mail order and eligibility changes will be successful nor can we predict whether the
recently adopted health care reform legislation will exacerbate this risk. 
 The availability of pharmacy drugs is subject to governmental regulations.  
        The continued conversion of various prescription drugs, including the planned conversion of a number of popular medications, to
over-the-counter medications may reduce our pharmacy sales and customers may seek to purchase such medications at non-pharmacy stores. Also, if the rate at which new prescription drugs become
available slows or if new prescription drugs that are introduced into the market fail to achieve popularity, our pharmacy sales may be adversely affected. The withdrawal of certain drugs from the
market or concerns about the safety or effectiveness of certain drugs or negative publicity surrounding certain categories of drugs may also have a negative effect on our pharmacy sales or may cause
shifts in our pharmacy or front end product mix. 
17

 Changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs and changes in industry pricing benchmarks could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on
our business.  
        Sales of prescription drugs reimbursed by third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and state sponsored Medicaid
and related managed care Medicaid agencies, represented 96.5% of our business in fiscal 2012. 
        The
continued efforts of the Federal government, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, other State and local government
entities, and other third-party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced, may impact our profitability. In
addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Any significant loss of
third-party business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
        Certain
provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ("DRA") sought to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic)
drugs ("AMP"). Although those reductions did not go into effect, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010 (the "Patient Care Act") enacted a modified
AMP reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs. The modified formula, when implemented, may reduce Medicaid reimbursements which could affect our revenues and profits. There have also been a number
of other recent proposals and enactments by the Federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget problems. We expect other
similar proposals in the future. 
 We are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements; our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business, the
results of our operations or our financial condition.  
        Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations. Changes in these regulations may require extensive system and
operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could
adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including: (i) suspension of payments from government programs; (ii) loss of required government certifications;
(iii) loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iv) loss of licenses; or
(v) significant fines or monetary penalties. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, federal, state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies;
applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or ("HIPAA"); laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and
safety matters, including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances; regulations of the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, the U. S. Department of
Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws;
false claims laws and federal and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. We are also governed by federal and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating
matters of wage and hour laws, working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. 
 Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services; our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.  
        Pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as
with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of 
18



 
Table of Contents
drugs.
In addition, federal and state laws that require our pharmacists to offer counseling, without additional charge, to their customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side
effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a
prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects. Although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, from time to time, claims result in the
payment of significant amounts, some portions of which are not funded by insurance. We cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against
future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the
future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self-insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission. 
 We will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified pharmacists.  
        Although more licensed pharmacists and new graduates are seeking positions in many markets there is still an unmet demand for
pharmacists in limited regions of the country that are challenging to staff. We continue to offer competitive compensation plans to retain and attract current and future pharmacists, work with
colleges of pharmacy across the U.S. to recruit both pharmacy interns and pharmacy graduates, but if the shortage recurs in one or more markets, our ability to compete effectively in any market could
be adversely impacted. 
 We may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.  
        Products that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage requiring us to recall our
private brand products. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability claims may be asserted against us with respect
to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell and we may be obligated to recall our private brand products. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material,
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers and associates, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private
litigation.  
        Through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store certain personal information that our customers provide to purchase
products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our web site, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. We also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal
course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information,
security could be compromised and confidential customer or business information misappropriated. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and
expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of
new operational processes. For example, in July 2010, settlement orders between us and the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights were
accepted by the agencies. The agencies' allegations were that we failed to protect patient and associate identifiable information. As a result of these settlement orders, we, without admitting any
liability, agreed to pay a $1.1 million penalty and are required to establish a

        We
lease 4,408 of our operating drugstore facilities under non-cancelable leases, many of which have original terms of 10 to 22 years. In addition to minimum rental payments,
which are set at competitive market rates, certain leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for taxes, maintenance and insurance. Most of our leases contain
renewal options, some of which involve rent increases. The remaining 259 drugstore facilities are owned.

distribution locations. 

        The
original terms of the leases for our distribution centers and satellite distribution locations range from 5 to 22 years. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain
distribution centers require tax reimbursement, maintenance and insurance. Most leases contain renewal options, some of which involve rent increases. Although from time to time, we may be near
capacity at some of our distribution facilities, particularly at our older facilities, we believe that the capacity of our facilities is adequate. 
        We
also own a 55,800 square foot ice cream manufacturing facility located in El Monte, California. 
        On
a regular basis and as part of our normal business, we evaluate store performance and may reduce in size, close or relocate a store if the store is redundant, underperforming or
otherwise deemed unsuitable. We also evaluate strategic dispositions and acquisitions of facilities and prescription files. When we reduce in size, close or relocate a store or close distribution
center facilities, we often continue to have leasing obligations or own the property. We attempt to sublease this space. As of March 3, 2012, we had 8,633,833 square feet of excess space,
4,907,155 square feet of which was subleased.

    Item 3.    Legal Proceedings     
        While we cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, we do not believe that any of these
matters will have a material effect on our business or financial condition. We cannot give assurance, however, that an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters will not have a material
effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved. 
        We
are currently a defendant in several putative collective or class action lawsuits filed in federal or state courts in several states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Washington and Oregon, purportedly on behalf of, in some cases (i) current and former assistant store managers and co-managers or
(ii) current and former store managers and assistant store managers, respectively, working in the our stores at various locations. The lawsuits allege violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act
and of certain state wage and hour statutes. The lawsuits seek various combinations of unpaid compensation (including overtime compensation), liquidated damages, exemplary damages, pre-and
post-judgment interest as well as attorneys' fees and costs. In one of the cases, Craig et al v. Rite Aid Corporation et al, pending
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, brought on behalf of current and former assistant store managers, the Court, on December 9, 2009, conditionally
certified a nationwide collective group of individuals who worked for us as assistant store managers since December 9, 2006. Notice of the Craig
action was sent to the purported members of the collective group (approximately 6,700 current and former assistant store managers) and approximately 1,100 joined the  Craig action. We have filed a motion
to decertify the class which is presently pending. In another of the cases, Indergit v.
Rite Aid Corporation et al, pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, brought on behalf of current and former store managers, the
Court, on April 2, 2010, conditionally certified a nationwide collective group of individuals who worked for the Company as store managers since March 31, 2007. The Court ordered that
Notice of the Indergit action be sent to the purported members of the collective group (approximately 7,000 current and former store managers) and
approximately 1,550 joined the Indergit action. In another of the cases, Ibea v. Rite Aid Corporation et
al, pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, brought on behalf of former salaried co-managers, the Court, on
January 9, 2012, conditionally certified a collective group of individuals who worked for us as salaried co-managers. The Court ordered that Notice of the  Ibea action be sent to the purported
members of the collective group (approximately 650 former salaried co-managers) and approximately 140
joined the Ibea action. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the
lawsuits. Our management believes, however, that the lawsuits are without merit and not appropriate for collective or class action treatment. We are vigorously defending all of these claims. 
        We
are currently a defendant in several putative class action lawsuits filed in state courts in California alleging violations of California wage and hour laws, rules and regulations
pertaining primarily to pay for missed meals and rest periods and failure to provide employee seating. These suits purport to be class actions and seek substantial damages. At this time, we are not
able to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuits. Our management believes, however, that the plaintiffs' allegations are without merit and
that their claims are not appropriate for class action treatment. We are vigorously defending all of these claims. 
        We
were served with a United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") subpoena dated March 5, 2010 in connection with an
investigation being conducted by the OIG, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the United States Department of Justice Commercial Litigation Branch. The
subpoena requests records related to any gift card or similar programs for customers who transferred prescriptions for drugs or medicines to our pharmacies, and whether any customers who receive
federally funded prescription benefits (e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) may have benefited from those programs. We are in the process

of
completing our production of records in response to the subpoena and are unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the government of such information. 
        We
received a subpoena dated May 9, 2011 from certain California counties seeking information regarding compliance with environmental regulations governing the management of
hazardous waste. We are completing our production of records in response to the subpoena. We are unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the government of such
information. 
        We
were served with a Civil Investigative Demand Subpoena Duces Tecum dated August 26, 2011 by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. The
subpoena requests records regarding the relationship of Rite Aid's Rx Savings Program to the reporting of usual and customary charges to publicly funded health programs. We are in the process of
communicating with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding the scope of the subpoena and are unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the government of such information. 
        We
are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of our business. While our management cannot predict the
outcome of these claims with certainty, our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material effect on its financial statements.

        We
have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2000 and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future. Our senior secured credit facility and some of the indentures that govern our other outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends. 
        We
have not sold any unregistered equity securities during the period covered by this report, nor have we repurchased any equity securities, during the period covered by this report. 
        Our
Chief Executive Officer certified to the NYSE on July 13, 2011 that he was not aware of any violation by the Company of the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards.

  STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH     
        The graph below compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock for the last five
fiscal years with the cumulative total return on (i) the Russell 1000 Consumer Staples Index and (ii) the Russell 1000 Index, over the same period (assuming the investment of $100.00 in
our common stock and such indexes on March 3, 2007 and reinvestment of dividends). 
        For
comparison of cumulative total return, we have elected to use the Russell 1000 Consumer Staples Index, consisting of 49 companies, including two of our largest competitors, and the
Russell 1000 Index. This allows comparison of the company to a peer group of similar sized companies. The Russell 1000 Consumer Staples Index is a capitalization-weighted index of companies that
provide products directly to consumers that are typically considered nondiscretionary items based on consumer purchasing habits. The Russell 1000 Index consists of the largest 1000 companies in the
Russell 3000 Index and represents the universe of large capitalization stocks from which many active money managers typically select.

         Lease termination and impairment charges:    We recorded lease terminations and impairment charges of $100.1 million in fiscal 2012
compared to
$210.9 million and $208.0 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        LIFO Charges:    We record the value of our inventory on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. We recorded non-cash
LIFO charges of $188.7 million, $44.9 million and $88.5 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher LIFO charge this year is due to higher inflation on both
pharmacy and front end products. 
         Debt Refinancing:    In fiscal 2012, we continued to take steps to extend the terms of our debt and obtain more flexibility. In March 2011,
 we entered
into a new $343.0 million Tranche 5 Term Loan under our senior secured credit facility, the proceeds of which were used to repay and retire all borrowings under
our Tranche 3 Term Loans. In connection with the Tranche 3 Term Loan repayment and retirement we recorded a loss on debt modification of $22.4 million during the first quarter of
fiscal 2012 due to the write off of debt issue costs of $2.7 million and unamortized original issuance discount of $19.7 million. 
        In
August 2011, we repurchased $41.0 million of our 8.625% senior notes due March 2015, $5.0 million of our 9.375% senior notes due December 2015 and $4.5 million of
our 6.875% senior debentures due August 2013. These repurchases resulted in a gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 of $5.0 million. 
        In
February 2012, we issued $481.0 million of our 9.25% senior notes due March 2020. These notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally
in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. Our obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured unsubordinated basis,
by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facility and our outstanding 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020, 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016, 10.375%
senior secured notes due 2016, 7.5% senior secured notes due 2017, 10.25% senior secured notes due 2019, 9.375% senior notes due 2015 and 9.5% senior notes due 2017. The proceeds of the notes,
together with available cash, were used to repurchase and repay all of the outstanding 8.625% senior notes due March 2015. In February 2012, we completed a tender offer for the 8.625% notes in which
$404.8 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 8.625% notes were tendered and repurchased by us. In February 2012, we called for the redemption of the remaining 8.625% notes. We
redeemed the remaining 8.625% notes in March 2012 for $55.7 million which included the call premium and interest through the call date. The refinancing resulted in a loss in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2012 of $16.1 million. 
        These
transactions are described in more detail in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.

        Income Tax:    Net loss for fiscal 2012 included income tax benefit of $23.7 million, compared to income tax expense of
$9.8 million for
fiscal 2011 and income tax expense of $26.8 million for fiscal 2010. The benefit recognized in fiscal 2012 was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse
of statute of limitations compared to income tax expense for fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily for the accrual of state and local taxes and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits. We maintain a full
valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. ASC 740, "Income Taxes" requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against
the net deferred tax assets is required. A cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable. Based on the negative evidence,
ASC 740 precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets. 
         Dilutive Equity Issuances:    On March 3, 2012, 898.7 million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional
129.8 million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options, convertible preferred stock and convertible notes. 
        On
March 3, 2012, our 129.8 million shares of potentially issuable common stock consisted of the following (shares in thousands):

(a)The
exercise of these options would provide cash of $112.4 million.
(b)On
March 21, 2011, we launched a Stock Option Exchange Program ("Program") for eligible associates only. Under the Program, eligible associates had
the opportunity to surrender certain stock options for a lesser number of new stock options with an exercise price that was determined based on the closing market price on April 21, 2011, the
day the Program concluded. The number of new options was determined by applying exchange ratios that resulted in providing new stock options with an aggregate fair value that approximated the
aggregate fair value of the options they replaced. The new options vest over two years and have a five year life with an exercise price of $1.03. A total of 14.0 million options with an average
exercise price in excess of $1.77 were cancelled and 5.3 million new options were granted with an exercise price of $1.03. The Company recognized a minimal incremental compensation expense as a
result of the Program.

 Revenues  

         Fiscal 2012 compared to Fiscal 2011:    The 3.6% increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in same store sales and an
additional week in
fiscal 2012. The increase in same store sales was driven by the positive impact of our wellness + loyalty program, our flu immunization program and other management initiatives to
increase sales and prescriptions. These increases were partially offset due to lower pharmacy reimbursement rates and by operating fewer stores than last year. Same store sales trends for fiscal 2012
and fiscal 2011 are described in the following paragraphs. We include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year. Stores in liquidation are considered closed. Relocation
stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed. 
        Pharmacy
same store sales increased 2.4%. Pharmacy same store sales were positively impacted by an increase of 0.9% in same store prescriptions driven in part by our immunization
program, our wellness + loyalty program and inflation on brand drugs. Same store sales were also positively impacted
by new customers resulting from the decrease in the number of pharmacies in the Express Scripts pharmacy benefit management network, partially offset by an approximate 1.7% negative impact from new
generic introductions and lower reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers and government payors. 
        Front
end same store sales increased 1.1% from the prior year reflecting the positive impact of our wellness + program and other management initiatives to increase sales in
the front end. The trend improved during our fourth quarter to a same store sales increase of 1.6% due to continued growth in our wellness + program and strong seasonal sales. 
29



 
Table of Contents
         Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010:    The 1.8% decline in revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in our store base and a decline in
same store
sales, which decreased 0.7% compared to prior year. This decline consisted of 0.9% pharmacy same store sales decrease and a 0.3% decrease in front end same store sales. Additionally, revenues
decreased 0.2% compared to the prior year due to revenue deferrals related to our wellness + loyalty program. 
        Pharmacy
same store sales decreased 0.9%. Same store prescriptions decreased 1.2%. The decline in same store prescriptions was impacted by a slower start and overall softer cough, cold
and flu season, coupled with an increase in 90-day prescriptions compared to last year. Same store sales were negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates, increased generic
penetration and the prescription decline. These trends improved during our fourth quarter as the cough, cold and flu season intensified contributing to same store pharmacy sales increased 0.8%. 
        Front
end same store sales decreased 0.3% from the prior year due to weakness in the overall economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior, partially offset by
various management initiatives, such as our wellness + loyalty card program. The trend improved during our fourth quarter due largely to the later cough, cold and flu season and our
wellness + loyalty card program, which resulted in a front-end same store sales increase of 1.0% compared to the fourth quarter last year.

 Cost of Goods Sold  

        Gross profit increased by $100.8 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to overall revenue growth. Pharmacy gross
profit was higher due to increased prescription volume and the introduction of new generics including generic Lipitor, partially offset by continued pressure on pharmacy benefit manager and
governmental reimbursement rates. Front-end gross profit was driven by higher sales reflecting the positive impact of our wellness + loyalty program and continued strong Rite
Aid Brand private label penetration. 
        Overall
gross margin was 26.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to 26.5% in fiscal 2011. Front end gross margin was lower due to a higher LIFO charge partially offset by increased private label
penetration. 
30



 
Table of Contents
Pharmacy
gross margin was lower due to a higher LIFO charge and continued reimburse rate pressure partially offset by new generic introductions. 
        Gross
profit decreased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to lower same store sales and higher wellness + loyalty program revenue deferrals. Gross margin was 26.5%
for fiscal 2011 compared to 26.6% in fiscal 2010. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to deferred revenue related to our wellness + customer loyalty program and a slight
reduction in pharmacy gross margin, partially offset by lower product costs and new generic introductions. There was a negative impact from the reductions in Medicare reimbursements resulting from the
AWP rollback which was fully cycled in September 2010. The pharmacy margin pressure slowed as we continued to cycle the more significant maximum allowable costs ("MAC") of new generics which occurred
last year. Front-end gross margin was lower due primarily to an increase in deferred revenue related to our wellness + customer loyalty program and related discounts.
Partially offsetting the lower gross margin discussed above was a reduction in LIFO and inventory cost capitalization charges. 
        We
use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation, which is determined annually when inflation rates and inventory levels are finalized.
Therefore, LIFO costs for interim period financial statements are estimated. The LIFO charge was $188.7 million in fiscal 2012, $44.9 million in fiscal 2011, and $88.5 million in
fiscal 2010. The increase in the LIFO charge in fiscal 2012 is due to higher inflation on both pharmacy and front end products. The pharmacy inflation rate in fiscal 2012 was 6.6% higher than the
prior year and front-end inflation was over 1.7% higher than the prior year. 

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

        SG&A expenses increased by $73.6 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due mostly to expenses associated with the
fifty-third week in fiscal 2012. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved over fiscal 2011 due to leveraging our fixed costs relative to revenue growth. SG&A for fiscal 2012 was 25.0% as a percentage
of revenue, compared to 25.6% in fiscal 2011. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from continued labor control initiatives,
lower occupancy and lower depreciation and amortization, and other cost containment initiatives. These favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense relating to improved
results and higher workers' compensation costs associated with unfavorable discount rate changes. 
        SG&A
for fiscal 2011 was 25.6% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and
benefit costs due to better labor control and reductions in store operating expenses and corporate administrative expenses resulting from our various cost reduction initiatives. Additionally, we
incurred no securitization fees due to our elimination of the receivables securitization facilities on October 26, 2009. These cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in debit and
credit card fees, and higher workers' compensation and general liability costs due to a reserve reduction caused by favorable claims experience recorded in the prior year. 

 Lease Termination and Impairment Charges  

 Impairment Charges:  
        We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group has a
carrying value that may not be recoverable. The individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. As such, we evaluate individual stores for recoverability. To
determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability, we consider items such as decreases in market prices, changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition, changes
in legal factors or business climate, an accumulation of losses significantly in excess 
31



 
Table of Contents
of
budget, a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses, or an expectation that the store will be closed
or sold. 
        We
monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics, new competitive entries and other local market
considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required. For other stores, we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current-period and historical cash flow losses. 
        In
performing the recoverability test, we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets. Significant judgment is used to estimate future cash
flows. Major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales, gross profit, and distribution expenses; expected costs such as payroll, occupancy costs and
advertising expenses; and estimates for other significant selling, and general and administrative expenses. Many long-term macro-economic and industry factors are considered, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, in our future cash flow assumptions. In addition to current and expected economic conditions such as inflation, interest and unemployment rates that affect customer
shopping patterns, we consider that we operate in a highly competitive industry which includes the actions of other national and regional drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores,
supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Many of our competitors are spending significant
capital and promotional dollars in certain geographies to gain market share. We have assumed certain sales growth from a new loyalty program, which although it's in its early marketing stages, is
expected to not only retain but gain loyal customers. Recent and proposed Pharmacy Benefit Management consolidation and efforts of third party public and private payers have reduced pharmacy
reimbursement rates in recent years. We expect this rate compression, which currently affects over 96% of our pharmacy business, to continue to affect us in the foreseeable future. We operate in a
highly regulated industry and must make assumptions related to Federal and State efforts and proposals to affect the pricing and regulations related to prescription drugs, as well as, expected
revenues and costs related to the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (health care reform). 
        Additionally,
we take into consideration that certain operating stores are executing specific improvement plans which are monitored quarterly to recoup recent capital investments, such
as an acquisition of an independent pharmacy, which we have made to respond to specific competitive or local market conditions, or have specific programs tailored towards a specific geography or
market. 
        We
recorded impairment charges of $52.0 million in fiscal 2012, $115.1 million in fiscal 2011 and $75.5 million in fiscal 2010. Our methodology for recording
impairment charges has not changed materially, and has been consistently applied in the periods presented. 
        At
March 3, 2012, approximately $2.0 billion of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, were associated with 4,667 active operating stores. 
        If
an operating store's estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value, its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future
discounted cash flows. The discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset. 
        An
impairment charge is recorded in the period that the store does not meet its original return on investment and/or has an operating loss for the last two years and its projected cash
flows do not exceed its current carrying cost. The amount of the impairment charge is the entire difference between the current carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets using
discounted future cash flows. Most stores are fully impaired in the period that the impairment charge is originally recorded. 
        We
recorded impairment charges for active stores of $43.4 million in fiscal 2012, $109.0 million in fiscal 2011 and $48.9 million in fiscal 2010.

Table of Contents 
        We review key performance results for active stores on a quarterly basis and approve certain stores for closure. Impairment for closed stores, if any (many stores
are closed on lease expiration), are recorded in the quarter the closure decision is made and approved. Most stores are physically closed within a quarter of the closure decision. Closure decisions
are made on an individual store or regional basis considering all of the macro-economic, industry and other factors discussed above, in addition to, the operating store's individual operating results.
We currently have no plans to close a significant number of active stores in future periods. In the next fiscal year, we currently expect to close 50 stores, primarily as a result of lease
expirations. We recorded impairment charges for closed facilities of $8.6 million in fiscal 2012, $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 and $26.6 million in fiscal 2010. 
        Included
in the impairment charges noted above were charges of $5.9 million in fiscal 2012, $2.4 million in fiscal 2011 and $12.3 million in fiscal 2010 for existing owned surplus
property. Assets to be disposed of are evaluated quarterly to determine if an additional impairment charge is required. Fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the
local markets where the assets are located. 
        The
following table summarizes the impairment charges and number of locations, segregated by closed facilities and active stores that have been recorded in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010:

(1)These
charges are related to stores that were impaired for the first time in prior periods. Most active stores, requiring an impairment charge, are fully
impaired in the first period that they do not meet their asset recoverability test. However, in each prior period presented, a minority of 

33



 
Table of Contents


stores
were partially impaired since their fair value supported a reduced net book value. Accordingly, these stores may be further impaired in the current and future periods as a result of changes in
their actual or projected cash flows, or changes to their fair value estimates. Also, we make ongoing capital additions to certain stores to improve their operating results or to meet geographical
competition, which if later are deemed to be unrecoverable, will be impaired in future periods. Of this total, 583, 577 and 431 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively have been fully
impaired.  


(2)These
charges are related to new stores (open at least 3 years) and relocated stores (relocated in the last 2 years) that did not meet their
recoverability test during the current period. These stores have not met our original return on investment projections and have a historical loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash flow
projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 19, 43 and 30 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively have been fully impaired.
(3)These
charges are related to the remaining active stores that did not meet the recoverability test during the current period. These stores have a historical
loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 43, 141 and 92 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively
have been fully impaired. 

        The
primary drivers of our impairment charges are each store's current and historical operating performance and the assumptions that we make about each store's operating performance in
future periods. Projected cash flows are updated based on the next year's operating budget which includes the qualitative factors noted above. We are unable to predict with any degree of certainty
which individual stores will fall short or exceed future operating plans. Accordingly, we are unable to describe future trends that would affect our impairment charges, including the likely stores and
their related asset values that may fail their recoverability test in future periods. 
        To
the extent that actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially, because of the reasons discussed above, certain stores that are either not impaired or partially
impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods. A 100 basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of March 3, 2012 would have resulted in an additional
fiscal 2012 impairment charge of $11.0 million. A 100 basis point increase in our future sales assumptions as of March 3, 2012 would have reduced the fiscal 2012 impairment charge by $7.0
million. Changes in our discount rate of 50 basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal 2012. 
         Facility and Equipment Lease Exit Charges:    Charges to close a store, which principally consist of continuing lease obligations, are
recorded at the
time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated, pursuant to the guidance set forth in ASC 420, "Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations." We calculate our liability for closed stores on a
store-by-store basis. The calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net
of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations. We evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability
accordingly. As part of our ongoing business activities, we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure. Decisions to close stores or distribution centers in future periods would
result in charges for lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory, as well as impairment of assets at these locations. 
        In
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded facility and equipment lease exit charges of $48.1 million, $95.8 million and $132.5 million. These charges related to changes in future
assumptions, interest accretion and provisions for 23 stores in fiscal 2012, 52 stores and one distribution center in fiscal 2011, and 108 stores and one distribution center in fiscal 2010.

 Interest Expense  

        In fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, interest expense was $529.3 million, $547.6 million and $515.8 million, respectively. The reduction in
interest expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to favorable interest rates resulting from our March 2011 Tranche 3 Term Loan refinancing and the August 2010
refinancing of our Tranche 4 Term Loan partially offset by the impact of the fifty-third week. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the
prior year refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and the elimination of our securitization program which was previously recorded in SG&A, partially offset by savings from our current year
refinancing of our $650.0 million senior secured credit facility term loan. 
        The
annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 7.4%, 7.5% and 6.8%, respectively. 

 Income Taxes  

        Income tax benefit of $23.7 million, income tax expense of $9.8 million and income tax expense of $26.8 million, has been recorded for
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net loss for fiscal 2012 included income tax benefit of $23.7 million and was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse
of statute of limitations. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. ASC 740, "Income Taxes" requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis
to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we take into account all available positive and
negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history, expected future earnings, the character and jurisdiction of such earnings, unsettled
circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could
potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable.
Based on the negative evidence, ASC 740 precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods. 
        The
fiscal 2011 income tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes, adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and the need for an accrual
of additional state taxes resulting from the receipt of a final audit determination. The fiscal 2010 income tax expense of $26.8 million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes
net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits. We monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets. We maintained a
full valuation allowance of $2,317.4 million and $2,199.3 million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 General  
        We have three primary sources of liquidity: (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash provided by operating activities and
(iii) borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our senior secured credit facility. Our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations, to service our obligations
to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures. Total liquidity as of March 3, 2012 was $913.7 million, which consisted of revolver borrowing capacity of $910.8 million
and invested cash of $2.9 million. We also had cash of $55.7 million at year end that we had set aside to finalize the call of our remaining 8.625% guaranteed unsecured notes due 2015. These notes
were satisfied and discharged on March 14, 2012.

Table of Contents 
 Credit Facility  
        Our senior secured credit facility consists of a $1.175 billion revolving credit facility and two term loans. Borrowings under the
revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum between LIBOR plus 3.25% and LIBOR plus 3.75%, if we choose to make LIBOR borrowings, or between Citibank's base rate plus 2.25% and
Citibank's base rate plus 2.75% in each case based upon the amount of revolver availability as defined in the senior secured credit facility. We are required to pay fees between 0.50% and 0.75% per
annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver, depending on the amount of revolver availability. Amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on August 19, 2015, provided that
such maturity date shall instead be April 18, 2014 in the event that on or prior to April 18, 2014 we do not repay, refinance or otherwise extend the maturity date of our
Tranche 2 Term Loan (as defined below) to a date that is at least 90 days after August 19, 2015 and, in the case of a repayment or refinancing, we must have at least $500.0
million of availability under the revolver. 
        Our
ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files. At March 3, 2012, we had
$136.0 million borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of $128.2 million, which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of $910.8
million. 
        The
credit facility also includes our $1.044 billion senior secured term loan (the "Tranche 2 Term Loan"). The Tranche 2 Term Loan will mature on June 4, 2014 and
currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%, if we choose to make LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank's base rate plus 0.75%. We must make mandatory prepayments of the
Tranche 2 Term Loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events (subject to certain limitations), with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us (as defined in the
senior secured credit facility) and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt (subject to certain exceptions). If at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our
senior secured credit facility, prepayment of the Tranche 2 Term Loan may also be required. 
        On
March 3, 2011, we refinanced the Tranche 3 Term Loan with a $331.8 million senior secured term loan (the "Tranche 5 Term Loan"). The Tranche 5 Term Loan
matures on March 3, 2018, although the maturity will instead be September 16, 2015, in the event that we do not repay or refinance our outstanding 9.375% senior notes due 2015 prior to
that time. The Tranche 5 Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.25% with a 1.25% LIBOR floor. We must make mandatory prepayments of the Tranche 5 Term Loan
with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events (subject to certain limitations), with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us (as defined in the senior secured credit facility)
and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt (subject to certain exceptions). If at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility,
prepayment of the Tranche 5 Term Loan may also be required. 
        The
senior secured credit facility also restricts us and the subsidiary guarantors from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200.0 million at any time when revolving loans are
outstanding (not including cash located in our store deposit accounts, cash necessary to cover our current liabilities and certain other exceptions) and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver
borrowings in excess of $100.0 million over three consecutive business days. The senior secured credit facility also states that if at any time (other than following the exercise of remedies or
acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority
debt) either (a) an event of default exists under our senior secured credit facility or (b) the sum of revolver availability under our senior secured credit facility and certain amounts
held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than $100.0 million for three consecutive business days (a "cash sweep period"), the funds in our deposit
accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility, 
36



 
Table of Contents
and
then held as Collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility. 
        The
senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1.5 billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings
under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750.0 million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require
scheduled payments of principal prior to three months after June 4, 2014. The senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond
three months after June 4, 2014; however, other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of
incurrence of said debt. The senior secured facility also allows, so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default, for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before
June 4, 2014, for the voluntary repurchase of debt with a maturity after June 4, 2014 and the mandatory repurchase of our 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 if we maintain availability on
the revolving credit facility of more than $100.0 million. 
        Our
senior secured credit facility contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above, the payment of dividends, sale of
assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens. Our credit facility has a financial covenant, which is the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenant requires that, if
availability on the revolving credit facility is less than $150.0 million, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.05 to 1.00. As of March 3, 2012, we were in compliance
with this financial covenant. 
        The
senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy. It is also an event of default if we fail
to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of $50.0 million or any event occurs that enables, or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable,
the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt. The August 2010 amendments to the senior secured credit facility exclude the mandatory repurchase of the 8.5%
convertible notes due 2015 from this event of default. 
        The
indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by us. As of
March 3, 2012, the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under these indentures was approximately $1.0 billion (which amount does not include the ability to enter into
certain sale and leaseback transactions). However, we could not incur any additional secured debt as of February 27, 2010 assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit.
The ability to issue additional unsecured debt under these indentures is governed by an interest coverage ratio test. 
 Other 2012 Transactions  
        During August 2011, we repurchased $41.0 million of our 8.625% senior notes due March 2015, $5.0 million of our 9.375%
senior notes due December 2015 and $4.5 million of our 6.875% senior debentures due August 2013. These repurchases resulted in a gain for the period of $5.0 million. 
        In
February 2012, we issued $481.0 million of our 9.25% senior notes due March 2020. These notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally
in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. Our obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured unsubordinated basis,
by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facility and our outstanding 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020, 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016, 10.375%
senior secured notes due 2016, 7.5% senior secured notes due 2017, 10.25% senior secured notes due 2019, 9.375% senior notes due 2015 and 9.5% senior notes due 2017. The proceeds of the notes,
together with available cash, will be used to repurchase and repay all the outstanding 8.625% senior notes due 
37



 
Table of Contents
March 1,
2015. In February 2012, $404.8 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 8.625% notes were tendered and repurchased by us. In February 2012, we called for the
redemption of the remaining 8.625% notes. We redeemed the remaining 8.625% notes in March 2012 for $55.7 million which included the call premium and interest through the call date. The
refinancing resulted in a loss for the period of $16.1 million. 
 2011 Transactions  
        In August 2010, we issued $650.0 million of our 8.00% senior secured notes due August 15, 2020. These notes are
unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. Our obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject
to certain limitations, by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility and our 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016. These guarantees are shared, on a
senior basis, with debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and our 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016. The indenture that governs the 8.00% notes contains covenant provisions that,
among other things, allow the holders of the notes to participate along with the term loan holders and holders of our 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016 in the mandatory prepayments resulting from
the proceeds of certain asset dispositions (at the option of the noteholder) and include limitations on our ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur debt, grant
liens, sell assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. 
        In
July 2010, we repurchased $93.8 million of our $158.0 million outstanding 8.5% convertible notes. The remaining 8.5% convertible notes require us to maintain a listing
on the NYSE or certain other exchanges. In the event of a NYSE delisting, holders of these notes could require us to repurchase them, which we have the ability to do under the terms of our senior
secured credit facility. On July 30,
2010, we received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE because the price of our common stock has fallen below the NYSE's minimum share price rule. Our common stock continued to trade
as usual on the NYSE and on March 1, 2011, we received notice that we have regained compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price listing requirement. We are currently in compliance with all
NYSE listing rules. 
 2010 Transactions  
        In October 2009, we issued $270.0 million of our 10.25% senior secured notes due October 15, 2019. The notes are
unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. Our obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject
to certain limitations, by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility. The guarantees are secured by shared second priority liens with holders of the
10.375% senior secured notes due 2016 and 7.5% senior secured notes due 2017. The indenture that governs the 10.25% notes contains covenant provisions that, among other things, include limitations on
our ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur debt, grant liens, sell assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. The 10.25% senior secured
notes due October 2019 were issued at 99.2% of par. 
        In
June 2009, we issued $410.0 million of 9.75% senior secured notes due June 12, 2016. These notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and
rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. Our obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, by the same subsidiaries that guarantee
the obligations under the senior secured credit facility and our 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020. These guarantees are shared, on a senior basis, with debt outstanding under the senior secured
credit facility and our 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020. The indenture that governs the 9.75% notes contains covenant provisions that, among other things, allow the holders of the notes to
participate along with the term loan holders and holders of our 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020 in mandatory prepayments resulting from the

proceeds
of certain asset dispositions (at the option of the noteholder) and include limitations on our ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur debt, grant
liens, sell assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. The 9.75% senior secured notes due June 2016 were issued at 98.2% of par. 
 Off Balance Sheet Obligations  
        Until October 26, 2009, we maintained securitization agreements (the "First Lien Facility") with several multi-seller
asset-backed commercial paper vehicles ("CPVs"). Under the terms of the First Lien Facility, we sold substantially all of our eligible third party pharmaceutical receivables to a bankruptcy remote
Special Purpose Entity ("SPE") and retained servicing responsibility. The SPE then transferred an interest in these receivables to various CPVs. We also maintained a $225.0 million second
priority accounts receivable securitization term loan ("Second Lien Facility"). 
        On
October 26, 2009, we terminated both accounts receivable securitization facilities and replaced them with senior secured notes, increased borrowing capacity under our existing
senior secured revolving credit facility and an increase in borrowings under our Tranche 4 Term Loan. As part of this refinancing, we incurred a prepayment penalty of $2.3 million in
relation to the Second Lien Facility and recognized $3.8 million of unamortized discount related to the Second Lien Facility. These charges were recorded as a component of selling, general, and
administrative expenses. 
        As
of March 3, 2012, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases included in the table below.

        Obligations
for income tax uncertainties pursuant to ASC 740, "Income Taxes" of approximately $83.8 million are not included in the table above as we are uncertain as to if or
when such amounts may be settled. 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating, Investing and Financing Activities  
        Cash flow provided by operating activities was $266.5 million in fiscal 2012. Cash flow was positively impacted by the reduction
in net loss, an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases partially offset by an increase in inventory resulting primarily from price inflation and increased store inventory to
support sales growth. 
        Cash
flow provided by operating activities was $395.8 million in fiscal 2011. Cash flow was positively impacted by a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable due
to the timing of
purchases. Additionally, the reductions in accounts receivable were no longer offset by repayments to the receivables securitization facility which was eliminated in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. 
        Cash
flow used in operating activities was $325.1 million in fiscal 2010. Cash flow was negatively impacted by the repayments of the accounts receivable securitization facilities
totaling $555.0 million and a decrease in accounts payable offset by a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts receivables, inventory and accounts payable were
due to operating fewer stores and various working capital initiatives. 
        Cash
used in investing activities was $221.2 million in fiscal 2012. Cash was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially
offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and sale-leaseback transactions. 
        Cash
used in investing activities was $156.7 million in fiscal 2011. Cash was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially
offset by proceeds from asset dispositions. 
        Cash
used in investing activities was $120.5 million in fiscal 2010. Cash was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in
part by proceeds from asset dispositions. 
        Cash
provided by financing activities was $25.8 million in fiscal 2012 and was primarily due to increased revolver borrowings coupled with the February 2012 issuance of
$481.0 million of our 9.25% senior notes due March 15, 2020 and concurrent repurchase of $404.8 million of our 8.625% senior notes due March 2015. The remaining
$54.2 million of the 8.625% senior notes due March 2015 were repurchased in March 2012.

used in financing activities was $251.7 million in fiscal 2011 and was primarily due to the refinancing activity that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the
repurchase of $93.8 million of the Convertible Notes, other scheduled debt repayments and a small decrease in our zero balance cash accounts. 
        Cash
provided by financing activities was $397.1 million in fiscal 2010 due to proceeds from refinancings offset by a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and
the payment of financing fees related to the refinancings. 
 Capital Expenditures  
        During the fifty-three week period ended March 3, 2012, we spent $250.1 million on capital expenditures, consisting of
$94.0 million related to new store construction, store relocation and store remodel projects, $121.0 million related to technology enhancements, improvements to distribution centers and
other corporate requirements, and $35.1 million related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacists. We plan on making total capital expenditures of approximately
$300.0 million during fiscal 2013, consisting of approximately 58.3% related to store relocations and remodels and new store construction, 25.0% related to infrastructure and maintenance
requirements and 16.7% related to prescription file purchases. Management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities. 
 Future Liquidity  
        We are highly leveraged. Our high level of indebtedness: (i) limits our ability to obtain additional financing;
(ii) limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (iii) places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less
debt; (iv) renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and (v) requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt.
Based upon our current levels of operations, we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will
be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months. Based on our liquidity position, which we expect to remain strong
throughout the year, we do not expect the restriction on our credit facility, that could result if we fail to meet the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility, to impact our
business in the next twelve months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance, and other relevant
circumstances. Should we determine, at any time, that it is necessary to obtain additional short-term liquidity, we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain
sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us. From time to time, we may
seek deleveraging transactions, including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock, issuance of equity, repurchase outstanding indebtedness, or seek to refinance our
outstanding debt or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities. Any of these transactions could impact our financial results. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
        Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to inventory shrink, impairment of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, self insurance liabilities, lease exit liabilities, income taxes and
litigation. We base 
41



 
Table of Contents
our
estimates on historical experience, current and anticipated business conditions, the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
existing conditions. Variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and
sensitivity analyses. 
        The
following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management: 
         Inventory shrink:    The carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical
inventory
dates. When estimating these losses, we consider historical loss results at specific locations (including stores and distribution centers), as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical
inventory procedures. The estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period. Shrink
expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory. There have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over
the last three years. Although possible, we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods. A 10 basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended
March 3, 2012, would have affected pre-tax income by approximately $9.7 million. 
         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:    We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that an asset group has a carrying
value that may not be recoverable. The individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. As such, we evaluate individual stores for recoverability. To determine if
a store needs to be tested for recoverability, we consider items such as decreases in market prices, changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition, changes in legal
factors or business climate, an accumulation of losses significantly in excess of budget, a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a
projection of continuing losses, or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold. 
        We
monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics, new competitive entries and other local market
considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required. For other stores, we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current-period and historical cash flow losses. 
        In
performing the recoverability test, we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets. Significant judgment is used to estimate future cash
flows. Major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales and gross profit; expected costs such as payroll, occupancy costs and advertising expenses; and
estimates for other significant selling, general and administrative expenses. 
        If
an operating store's estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value, its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future
discounted cash flows. The discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset. 
        We
regularly approve certain stores for closure. Impairment charges for closed stores, if any, are evaluated and recorded in the quarter the closure decision is approved. 
        We
also evaluate assets to be disposed of on a quarterly basis to determine if an additional impairment charge is required. Fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who
operate in the local markets where the assets are located. 
        If
our actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially, certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in
future periods. A 100 basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of March 3, 2012 would have resulted in an additional fiscal 2012 impairment charge of $11.0 million. A 100
basis point increase in our future sales 
42



 
Table of Contents
assumptions
as of March 3, 2012 would have reduced the fiscal 2012 impairment charge by $7.0 million. Changes in our discount rate of 50 basis points would not have a material impact on
the total impairment recorded in fiscal 2012. 
         Revenue recognition:    For all sales other than third party pharmacy sales, we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time
the
merchandise is sold. For third party pharmacy sales, revenue is recognized at the time the prescription is filled, which is or approximates when the customer picks up the prescription. We record
revenue net of an allowance for estimated future returns. Return activity is immaterial to revenues and results of operations in all periods presented. 
        On
April 18, 2010, we launched our wellness+ loyalty card program chain wide. Members participating in our wellness+ loyalty card program earn points on a calendar year basis for
eligible front end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescriptions. One point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front end merchandise and 25 points are awarded for each qualifying
prescription. 
        Members
reach specific wellness+ tiers based on the points accumulated during the calendar year, which entitle them to certain future discounts and other benefits upon reaching that
tier. For example, any customer that reaches 1,000 points in a calendar year achieves the "Gold" tier, enabling the customer to receive a 20% discount on qualifying purchases of front end merchandise
for the remaining portion of the calendar year and the next calendar year. There are also similar "Silver" and "Bronze" levels with lower thresholds and benefit levels. 
        As
wellness+ customers accumulate points, we defer the value of the points earned as deferred revenue based on the expected usage. The amount deferred is based on historic and projected
customer activity (e.g., tier level, spending level). As customers receive discounted front end merchandise, we recognize an allocable portion of the deferred revenue. If the achieved combined
Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels differ from the assumptions by 5.0% then the revenue deferral changes by $1.1 million. If the assumed spending levels, which are the drivers of future discounts,
differ by 5.0% then the revenue deferral changes by $1.1 million. 
         Self-insurance liabilities:    We expense claims for self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance coverage
as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid. The expense for self-insured workers' compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined
using several factors, including historical claims experience and development, severity of claims, medical costs and the time needed to settle claims. We
discount the estimated expense for workers' compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years. We base our estimates for such
timing on previous settlement activity. The discount rate is based on the current market rates for Treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers' compensation claims. These
assumptions are updated on an annual basis. A 25 basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended March 3, 2012, would have affected pretax income by approximately
$1.8 million. 
         Lease exit liabilities:    We record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments, anticipated ancillary occupancy costs
and anticipated
future subleases of properties. The reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level. The reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using
a credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis. 
        A
substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of ASC 420, "Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations." Therefore, if interest rates change, reserves may be
increased or decreased. In addition, changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve. As of March 3, 2012, a 50 basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk
free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately $2.2 million for fiscal 2012.

Table of Contents 
        Income taxes:    We currently have net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and
state tax purposes. These NOLs generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering
the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability, projected taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax
planning strategies. The weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. We establish a valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. There have been no significant changes in the
assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years. However, changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of Brooks Eckerd on operations have caused
changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change. 
        We
recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not
previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities. 
         Litigation reserves:    We are involved in litigation on an on-going basis. We accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to
legal claims. Such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. These estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and/or change. To the
extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change. Changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal
years were not material. 
 Non GAAP Measures  
        In addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures, such as "Adjusted EBITDA",
in assessing our operating performance. We believe the non-GAAP measures serve as an appropriate measure to be used in evaluating the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net
income (loss) excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO adjustments, charges or credits for facility closing and impairment, inventory write-downs
related to store closings, stock-based compensation expense, debt modifications and retirements, sale of assets and investments, revenue deferrals related to customer loyalty programs and other items.
We reference this particular non-GAAP financial measure frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the
historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors' historical operating performance. In addition, incentive compensation is based on Adjusted EBITDA and we base
certain of our forward- looking estimates on Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow-up with comparisons of actual to
planned Adjusted EBITDA.

        In
addition to Adjusted EBITDA, we occasionally refer to several other Non-GAAP measures, on a less frequent basis, in order to describe certain components of our business
and how we utilize them to describe our results. These measures include but are not limited to Adjusted EBITDA
Gross Margin and Gross Profit (gross margin/gross profit adjusted for non-EBITDA items), Adjusted EBITDA SG&A (SG&A expenses adjusted for non-EBITDA items), FIFO Gross Margin
(gross margin before LIFO charges) and Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for interest, rent on closed stores, capital expenditures and the change in working capital). 
        We
include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcements and guidance in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better
compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA or other
non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, and are not intended to represent an alternative measure of, operating results or of cash flows from operating activities, as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies. 
 
    Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
        Our future earnings, cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Market risk
is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest
expense. We enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a
combination of variable-rate credit facilities, fixed-rate long-term obligations and derivative transactions. We currently do not have any derivative transactions
outstanding.

        Our ability to satisfy interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance, which, in turn, is
subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our
outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be
assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed. 
        The
interest rate on our variable rate borrowings, which include our revolving credit facility and our Tranche 2 Term loans and Tranche 5 Term loans, are all based on
LIBOR. However, the interest rate on our Tranche 5 Term loans has a LIBOR floor of 125 basis points. If the market rates of interest for LIBOR changed by 100 basis points as of March 3,
2012, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $10.4 million. 
        A
change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is
acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt
matures. Increases in interest rates would also impact our ability to refinance existing maturities on favorable terms.

(b)Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of
March 3, 2012, we did not have any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

 Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

        The attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on our internal
control over financial reporting is included after the next paragraph.  

(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
        There
has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter ended March 3, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Rite Aid Corporation
Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 
        We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Rite Aid Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 3, 2012, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. 
        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 3, 2012, based on the criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
        We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended March 3, 2012 of the Company and our report dated April 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Rite Aid Corporation
Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 
        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rite Aid Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 3, 2012. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rite Aid Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 3,
2012 and February 26, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 3, 2012, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
        We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
March 3, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 For the Years Ended March 3, 2012, February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010 
 (In thousands, except per share amounts) 
 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents  

        Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and which have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. 

 Allowance for Uncollectible Receivables  

        Approximately 96.5% of prescription sales are made to customers who are covered by third-party payors, such as insurance companies,
government agencies and employers. The Company recognizes receivables that represent the amount owed to the Company for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been
paid. The Company maintains a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible. This reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current
conditions. 

 Inventories  

        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory balances include the capitalization of certain costs related to
purchasing, freight and handling costs associated with placing inventory in its location and condition for sale. The Company uses the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of
accounting for substantially all of its inventories. At March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011, inventories were $1,063,123 and $875,012, respectively, lower than the amounts that would
have been reported using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The Company calculates its FIFO inventory valuation using the retail method for store inventories and the cost
method for distribution facility inventories. The LIFO charge was $188,722, $44,905 and $88,450 for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, a reduction in
inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in the liquidation of applicable LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a
$11,004, $2,647 and $33,085 cost of sales decrease, with a
corresponding reduction to the adjustment to LIFO for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. 

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

        Asset impairments are recorded when the carrying value of assets are not recoverable. For purposes of recognizing and measuring
impairment of long-lived assets, the Company categorizes assets of operating stores as "Assets to Be Held and Used" and "Assets to Be Disposed Of." The Company evaluates assets at the
store level because this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows ascertainable to evaluate impairment. Assets being tested for recoverability at the store level include tangible
long-lived assets and identifiable, finite-lived intangibles that arose in purchase business combinations. Corporate assets to be held and used are evaluated for impairment based on excess
cash flows from the stores that support those assets. 
        The
Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an impairment loss. Impairment losses are
measured as the

amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset. 

 Property, Plant and Equipment  

        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company provides for
depreciation using the straight-line method over the following useful lives: buildings30 to 45 years; equipment3 to 15 years. 
        Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. When determining the
amortization period of a leasehold improvement, the Company considers whether discretionary exercise of a lease renewal option is reasonably assured. If it is determined that the exercise of such
option is reasonably assured, the Company will amortize the leasehold improvement asset over the minimum lease term, plus the option period. This determination depends on the remaining life of the
minimum lease term and any economic penalties that would be incurred if the lease option is not exercised. 
        Capitalized
lease assets are recorded at the lesser of the present value of minimum lease payments or fair market value and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related
property or term of the lease. 
        The
Company capitalizes direct internal and external development costs associated with internal-use software. Neither preliminary evaluation costs nor costs associated with
the software after implementation are capitalized. For fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company capitalized costs of approximately $6,371, $4,759 and $4,256, respectively. 

 Intangible Assets  

        The Company has certain finite-lived intangible assets that are amortized over their useful lives. The value of favorable and
unfavorable leases on stores acquired in business combinations are amortized over the terms of the leases on a straight-line basis. Prescription files acquired in business combinations are
amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years on an accelerated basis, which approximates the anticipated prescription file retention and related cash flows. Purchased prescription files
acquired in other than business combinations are amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years on a straight-line basis. 

 Deferred Financing Costs  

        Costs incurred to issue debt are deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related debt
agreements. Amortization expense of deferred financing costs was $22,049, $23,797 and $20,789 for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 (In thousands, except per share amounts) 
 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Revenue Recognition  

        For all sales other than third party pharmacy sales, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time the
merchandise is sold. For third party pharmacy sales, revenue is recognized at the time the prescription is filled, which is or approximates when the customer picks up the prescription. The Company
records revenue net of an allowance for estimated future returns. Return activity is immaterial to revenues and results of operations in all periods presented. 
        On
April 18, 2010, the Company launched its wellness + loyalty card program chain wide. Members participating in the wellness + loyalty card program
earn points on a calendar year basis for eligible front end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescriptions. One point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front end merchandise and 25 points
are awarded for each qualifying prescription. 
        Members
reach specific wellness + tiers based on the points accumulated during the calendar year, which entitles such customers to certain future discounts and other
benefits upon reaching that tier. For example, any customer that reaches 1,000 points in a calendar year achieves the "Gold" tier, enabling them to receive a 20% discount on qualifying purchases of
front end merchandise for the remaining portion of the calendar year and also the next calendar year. There are also similar "Silver" and "Bronze" levels with lower thresholds and benefit levels. 
        As
wellness + customers accumulate points, the Company defers the retail value of the points earned as deferred revenue (included in other current and noncurrent
liabilities, based on the expected usage). The amount deferred is based on historic and projected customer activity (e.g., tier level, spending level). As customers receive discounted front end
merchandise, the Company recognizes an allocable portion of the deferred revenue. 

 Cost of Goods Sold  

        Cost of goods sold includes the following: the cost of inventory sold during the period, including related vendor rebates and
allowances, LIFO charges, costs incurred to return merchandise to vendors, inventory shrink, purchasing costs and warehousing costs, which include inbound freight costs from the vendor, distribution
payroll and benefit costs, distribution center occupancy costs and depreciation expense and delivery expenses to the stores. 

 Vendor Rebates and Allowances  

        Rebates and allowances received from vendors relate to either buying and merchandising or promoting the product. Buying and
merchandising related rebates and allowances are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold as product is sold. Buying and merchandising rebates and allowances include all types of vendor programs
such as cash discounts from timely payment of invoices, purchase discounts or rebates, volume purchase allowances, price reduction allowances and slotting allowances. Certain product promotion related
rebates and allowances, primarily related to advertising, are recorded as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses when the advertising commitment has been satisfied.

 (In thousands, except per share amounts) 
 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Rent  

        The Company records rent expense on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. The Company
begins to record rent expense at the time that the Company has the right to use the property. From time to time, the Company receives incentive payments from landlords that subsidize lease improvement
construction. These leasehold incentives are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. 

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

        Selling, general and administrative expenses include store and corporate administrative payroll and benefit costs, occupancy costs
which include retail store and corporate rent costs, facility and leasehold improvement depreciation and utility costs, advertising, repair and maintenance, insurance, equipment depreciation and
professional fees. 

 Repairs and Maintenance  

        Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Improvements and major repairs, which extend the useful life of
an asset, are capitalized and depreciated. 

 Advertising  

        Advertising costs, net of specific vendor advertising allowances, are expensed in the period the advertisement first takes place.
Advertising expenses, net of vendor advertising allowances, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $369,405, $367,412 and $375,118, respectively. 

 Insurance  

        The Company is self-insured for certain general liability and workers' compensation claims. For claims that are
self-insured, stop-loss insurance coverage is maintained for workers' compensation occurrences exceeding $1,000 and general liability occurrences exceeding $2,000. The Company
utilizes actuarial studies as the basis for developing reported claims and estimating claims incurred but not reported relating to the Company's self-insurance. Workers' compensation
claims are discounted to present value using a risk-free interest rate. 

 Benefit Plan Accruals  

        The Company has several defined benefit plans, under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the
plan. The Company records expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of ASC 715, "CompensationRetirement Benefits." Key
assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels.

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Stock-Based Compensation  

        The Company has several stock option plans, which are described in detail in Note 13. The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation under ASC 718, "CompensationStock Compensation." The Company recognizes option expense over the requisite service period of the award, net of an estimate for the impact of
award forfeitures. 

 Store Pre-opening Expenses  

        Costs incurred prior to the opening of a new or relocated store, associated with a remodeled store or related to the opening of a
distribution facility are charged against earnings when incurred. 

 Litigation Reserves  

        The Company is involved in litigation on an ongoing basis. The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss related to legal
claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with in-house counsel, and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. 

 Facility Closing Costs and Lease Exit Charges  

        When a store or distribution center is closed, the Company records an expense for unrecoverable costs and accrues a liability equal to
the present value at current credit adjusted risk-free interest rates of the remaining lease obligations and anticipated ancillary occupancy costs, net of estimated sublease income. Other
store or distribution center closing and liquidation costs are expensed when incurred. 

 Income Taxes  

        Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. 
        The
Company has net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes. These NOLs generate a significant
deferred tax asset. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. 
        The
Company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" and the Company adjusts these liabilities with changes in judgment as a result of the evaluation of new
information not
previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax
liabilities.

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Sales Tax Collected  

        Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to various governmental agencies are presented on a net basis (excluded from
revenues) in the Company's statement of operations. 

 Use of Estimates  

        The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 Significant Concentrations  

        The Company's pharmacy sales were primarily to customers covered by health plan contracts, which typically contract with a third party
payor that agrees to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. During fiscal 2012, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 66.4% of the Company's
pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor represented 22.9%, 23.8% and 21.2% of pharmacy sales during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Third party payors are entities such as an
insurance company, governmental agency, health maintenance organization or other managed care provider, and typically represent several health care contracts and customers. 
        During
fiscal 2012, state sponsored Medicaid agencies and related managed care Medicaid payors accounted for approximately 17.7% of the Company's pharmacy sales, the largest of which was
approximately 2.1% of the Company's pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2012, approximately 28.2% of the Company's pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D. Any significant loss of
third-party payor business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. 
        During
fiscal 2012, the Company purchased brand pharmaceuticals and some generic pharmaceuticals which amounted to approximately 90.9% of the dollar volume of its prescription drugs from
a single wholesaler, McKesson Corp. ("McKesson"), under a contract expiring April 1, 2013. With limited exceptions, the Company is required to purchase all of its branded pharmaceutical
products from McKesson. If the Company's relationship with McKesson was disrupted, the Company could have temporary difficulty filling prescriptions for brand named drugs until a replacement
wholesaler agreement was executed, which would negatively impact the business. The Company purchases almost all of its generic (non-brand name) pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers
which account for approximately 76% of its prescription volume. The loss of any one of the generic suppliers would not disrupt the Company's ability to fill generic (non-brand name)
prescriptions but could negatively impact the Company's results.

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Certain Business Risks and Management's Plans  

        The U.S. economy is currently in a continued downturn and the future economic environment may not fully recover to levels prior to the
downturn. The Company is highly leveraged and its substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect its ability to service debt or obtain additional
financing. As a result of the current condition of the credit markets, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company's operating results,
cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates rise significantly, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or
operations to meet its debt and other obligations or otherwise be required to delay its planned activities. 
        Management
believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal
2013. The Company has a $1,175,000 senior secured revolving credit facility of which $136,000 was outstanding at March 3, 2012. 

 Derivatives  

        The Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to increasing rates with respect to its variable rate
debt, when the Company deems it prudent to do so. Upon inception of interest rate swap agreements, or modifications thereto, the Company performs a comprehensive review of the interest rate swap
agreements based on the criteria as provided by ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging." As of March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011, the Company had no interest rate swap arrangements
or other derivatives. 

 Discontinued Operations  

        For purposes of determining discontinued operations, the Company has determined that the store level is a component of the entity
within the context of ASC 360, "Property, Plant and Equipment." A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial
reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company. The Company routinely evaluates its store base and closes non-performing stores. The Company evaluates the results of operations of these
closed stores both quantitatively and qualitatively to determine if it is appropriate for reporting as discontinued operations. Stores sold where the Company retains the prescription files are
excluded from the analysis as the Company retains direct cash flows resulting from the migration of revenue to existing stores. 

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

        In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment related to multiemployer pension plans. This
amendment increases the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about an employer's participation in individually significant multiemployer plans that offer pension and other postretirement benefits.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the guidance and modified the disclosures surrounding our participation in multiemployer plans
in Note 15, Multiemployer Plans that Provide Benefits.

 (In thousands, except per share amounts)  
 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  

        In June 2011, the FASB issued an amendment related to statements of comprehensive income. This amendment requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components
of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This amended guidance
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. In December 2011, the FASB issued another amendment related
to statements of comprehensive income. The Company will adopt this guidance in fiscal 2013. 
        In
May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to revise certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. This amendment establishes common requirements for measuring fair value
and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes are effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial
results. 
 2. Loss Per Share  

        Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock
that then shared in the income of the Company subject to anti-dilution limitations.

 3. Lease Termination and Impairment Charges  

 Impairment Charges  

        The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset
group has a carrying value that may not be recoverable. The individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. As such, the Company evaluates individual stores for
recoverability. To determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability, the Company considers items such as decreases in market prices, changes in the manner in which the store is being used or
physical condition, changes in legal factors or business climate, an accumulation of losses significantly in excess of budget, a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of
operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses, or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold. 
        The
Company monitors new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics, new competitive entries and other local
market considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required. For other stores, it performs a recoverability analysis if it has experienced current-period and historical cash flow
losses. 
        In
performing the recoverability test, the Company compares the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets. Significant judgment is used to estimate
future cash flows. Major assumptions that contribute to its future cash flow projections include expected sales, gross profit, and distribution expenses; expected costs such as payroll, occupancy
costs and advertising expenses; and estimates for other significant selling, and general and administrative expenses. Many long-term macro-economic and industry factors are considered,
both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the future cash flow assumptions. In addition to current and expected economic conditions such as inflation, interest and unemployment rates that affect
customer shopping patterns, the
Company considers that it operates in a highly competitive industry which includes the actions of other national and regional drugstore chains,

 3. Lease Termination and Impairment Charges (Continued) 
independently
owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Many of its competitors are spending significant capital and promotional dollars in certain
geographies to gain market share. The Company has assumed certain sales growth from a new loyalty program, which although it's in its early marketing stages, is expected to not only retain but gain
loyal customers. Recent and proposed Pharmacy Benefit Management consolidation and efforts of third party public and private payers have reduced pharmacy reimbursement rates in recent years. The
Company expects this rate compression, which currently affects over 96% of its pharmacy business, to continue to affect it in the foreseeable future. The Company operates in a highly regulated
industry and must make assumptions related to Federal and State efforts and proposals to affect the pricing and regulations related to prescription drugs, as well as, expected revenues and costs
related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (health care reform). 
        Additionally,
the Company takes into consideration that certain operating stores are executing specific improvement plans which are monitored quarterly to recoup recent capital
investments, such as an acquisition of an independent pharmacy, which it has made to respond to specific competitive or local market conditions, or have specific programs tailored towards a specific
geography or market. 
        The
Company recorded impairment charges of $51,998 in fiscal 2012, $115,121 in fiscal 2011 and $75,475 in fiscal 2010. The Company's methodology for recording impairment charges has not
changed materially, and has been consistently applied in the periods presented. 
        At
March 3, 2012, $1.979 billion of the Company's long-lived assets, including intangible assets, were associated with 4,667 active operating stores. 
        If
an operating store's estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value, its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future
discounted cash flows. The discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset. 
        An
impairment charge is recorded in the period that the store does not meet its original return on investment and/or has an operating loss for the last 2 years and its projected
cash flows do not exceed its current carrying cost. The amount of the impairment charge is the entire difference between the current carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets using
discounted future cash flows. Most stores are fully impaired in the period that the impairment charge is originally recorded. 
        The
Company recorded impairment charges for active stores of $43,353 in fiscal 2012, $108,999 in fiscal 2011 and $48,884 in fiscal 2010. 
        The
Company reviews key performance results for active stores on a quarterly basis and approves certain stores for closure. Impairment for closed stores, if any (many stores are closed
on lease expiration), are recorded in the quarter the closure decision is made and approved. Most stores are physically closed within a quarter of the closure decision. Closure decisions are made on
an individual store or regional basis considering all of the macro-economic, industry and other factors discussed above, in addition to, the active store's individual operating results. The Company
currently has no plans to close a significant number of operating stores in future periods. In the next fiscal year, the Company currently expects to close 50 stores, primarily as a result of lease
expirations. The Company recorded impairment charges for closed facilities of $8,645 in fiscal 2012, $6,122 in fiscal 2011 and $26,591 in fiscal 2010.

        Included
in the impairment charges noted above, the Company recorded charges of $5,863 in fiscal 2012, $2,433 in fiscal 2011 and $12,315 in fiscal 2010 for existing owned surplus
property. Assets to be disposed of are evaluated quarterly to determine if an additional impairment charge is required. Fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the
local markets where the assets are located.

(1)These
charges are related to stores that were impaired for the first time in prior periods. Most active stores, requiring an impairment charge, are fully
impaired in the first period that they do not meet their asset recoverability test. However, in each prior period presented, a minority of stores were partially impaired since their fair value
supported a reduced net book value.

 3. Lease Termination and Impairment Charges (Continued) 


Accordingly,
these stores may be further impaired in the current and future periods as a result of changes in their actual or projected cash flows, or changes to their fair value estimates. Also, the
Company makes ongoing capital additions to certain stores to improve their operating results or to meet geographical competition, which if later are deemed to be unrecoverable, will be impaired in
future periods. Of this total, 583, 577 and 431 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively have been fully impaired.  


(2)These
charges are related to new stores (open at least 3 years) and relocated stores (relocated in the last 2 years) that did not meet their
recoverability test during the current period. These stores have not met their original return on investment projections and have a historical loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash flow
projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 19, 43 and 30 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively have been fully impaired.
(3)These
charges are related to the remaining active stores that did not meet the recoverability test during the current period. These stores have a historical
loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 43, 141 and 92 stores for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively
have been fully impaired. 

        The
primary drivers of its impairment charges are each store's current and historical operating performance and the assumptions that the Company makes about each store's operating
performance in future periods. Projected cash flows are updated based on the next year's operating budget which includes the qualitative factors noted above. The Company is unable to predict with any
degree of certainty which individual stores will fall short or exceed future operating plans. Accordingly, the Company is unable to describe future trends that would affect its impairment charges,
including the likely stores and their related asset values that may fail their recoverability test in future periods. 
        The
Company prioritizes inputs used in measuring the fair value of its nonfinancial assets and liabilities into a hierarchy of three levels: Level 1quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and Level 3unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing. 
        Long-lived
assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for purposes of calculating impairment using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as defined in the
fair value hierarchy. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 2 inputs is determined by evaluating the current economic conditions in the geographic area for similar use
assets. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 3 inputs is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows and discounting them using a
risk-adjusted rate of interest. The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located.

 Facility and Equipment Lease Exit Charges  

        Charges to close a store, which principally consist of continuing lease obligations, are recorded at the time the store is closed and
all inventory is liquidated, pursuant to the guidance set forth in ASC 420, "Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations." The Company calculates the liability for closed stores on a store-by-store
basis. The calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated
cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting or favorable lease terminations. The Company evaluates these assumptions each quarter and adjusts the liability accordingly. 
        In
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded facility and equipment lease exit charges of $48,055, $95,772 and $132,542. These charges related to changes in future assumptions,
interest accretion and provisions for 23 stores in fiscal 2012, 52 stores and one distribution center in fiscal 2011, and 108 stores and one distribution center in fiscal 2010. 
        As
part of its ongoing business activities, the Company assesses stores and distribution centers for potential closure. Decisions to close stores or distribution centers in future
periods would result in charges for lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory, as well as impairment of assets at these

        Net
loss for fiscal 2012 included income tax benefit of $23,686 and was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statute of limitations. The
Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. ASC 740, "Income Taxes" requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a
valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required. According to ASC 740, a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets
are realizable. Based on the negative evidence, ASC 740 precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods.

 4. Income Taxes (Continued)  

        The fiscal 2011 income tax expense was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes, adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and the need for an accrual of additional
state taxes resulting from the receipt of a final audit determination. 
        The
fiscal 2010 income tax expense was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits.

$109,030
and $116,972, respectively. Additionally, any impact on the effective rate may be mitigated by the valuation allowance that is maintained against the Company's net deferred tax assets. 
        The
Company is indemnified by Jean Coutu Group for certain tax liabilities incurred for all years ended up to and including the acquisition date of June 4, 2007, related to the
Brooks Eckerd acquisition. Although the Company is indemnified by Jean Coutu Group, the Company remains the primary obligor to the tax authorities with respect to any tax liability arising for the
years prior to the acquisition. Accordingly, as of March 3, 2012, February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, the Company had a corresponding recoverable indemnification asset of
$156,797, $158,209 and $146,053 from Jean Coutu Group, included in the "Other Assets" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, to reflect the indemnification for such liabilities. 
        Over
the next 12 months, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax positions reflected in the table above could decrease by $209,266 ($69,152
of which would impact the effective tax rate) if its tax positions are sustained upon audit, the controlling statute of limitations expires or the Company agrees to a disallowance. The primary driver
of the decrease is contingent upon the timing of the conclusion of the pre-acquisition period's audit of the consolidated U.S. income tax returns for Brooks Eckerd and will impact the
effective rate by $38,816 and the overall decrease of unrecognized tax benefits by $168,229. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $41,037 of its remaining
unrecognized tax positions, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of the fiscal year as a result of concluding audits or lapse of statute of limitations. 
        The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to tax contingencies as income tax expense. Prior to the adoption of ASC 740, "Income Taxes," the Company included interest as
income tax expense and penalties as an operating expense. The Company recognized expense for interest and penalties in connection with tax matters of ($2,113), $8,937 and $12,267 for fiscal years
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011 the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties was $65,266 and $67,379,
respectively. 
        The
Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in those states where it does business. The consolidated federal income tax returns have been
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through fiscal 2008. However, any net operating losses that were generated in these prior closed years may be subject to examination by the
IRS upon utilization. The IRS has completed the examination of the consolidated U.S. income tax returns for Brooks Eckerd for the periods leading up to the acquisition which include fiscal years 2004
through 2007. A revenue agent report (RAR) has been received for each of the three audit cycles, with the last RAR received in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company appealed these audit
results. Management is actively in settlement discussions with the IRS Appellate Division which upon signature of a closing agreement will conclude the examination of the Brooks Eckerd
pre-acquisition periods. Management does not anticipate the impending IRS settlement to impact the net financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, the IRS settlement will
result in the resolution of tax contingencies associated with these tax years which will impact the fiscal 2013 effective rate. This amount will be completely offset by the reversal of the tax
indemnification asset which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative

expenses.
State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. However, as a result of filing amended returns, the
Company has statutes open in some states from fiscal 2004. 

 Net Operating Losses and Tax Credits  

        At March 3, 2012, the Company had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $3,891,357, the majority of
which will expire, if not utilized, between fiscal 2019 and 2022. 
        At
March 3, 2012, the Company had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $5,502,866, the majority of which will expire between fiscal 2017 and 2025. 
        At
March 3, 2012, the Company had federal business tax credit carryforwards of $59,187, the majority of which will expire between 2013 and 2020. In addition to these credits, the
Company had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $3,221. 

 Valuation Allowances  

        The valuation allowances as of March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011 apply to the net deferred tax assets of the Company.
The Company maintained a full valuation allowance of $2,317,425 and $2,199,302 against net deferred tax assets at March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011, respectively. 
 5. Accounts Receivable  

        The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for uncollectible accounts at
March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011 was $28,832 and $25,116, respectively. The Company's accounts receivable are due primarily from third-party payors (e.g., pharmacy benefit
management companies, insurance companies or governmental agencies) and are recorded net of any allowances provided for under the respective plans. Since payments due from third-party payors are
sensitive to payment criteria changes and legislative actions, the allowance is reviewed continually and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management. 
        Until
October 26, 2009, the Company maintained securitization agreements (the "First Lien Facility") with several multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper vehicles ("CPVs").
Under the terms of the First Lien Facility, the Company sold substantially all of its eligible third party pharmaceutical receivables to a bankruptcy remote Special Purpose Entity ("SPE") and retained
servicing responsibility. The SPE then transferred an interest in these receivables to various CPVs. The Company also maintained a $225,000 second priority accounts receivable securitization term loan
(the "Second Lien Facility"). 
        On
October 26, 2009, the Company terminated both accounts receivable securitization facilities and replaced them with senior secured notes, increased borrowing capacity under the
Company's existing senior secured revolving credit facility and an increase in borrowings the Company's Tranche 4 Term Loan. As part of this refinancing, the Company incurred a prepayment
penalty of $2,250 in

 (In thousands, except per share amounts) 
 9. Indebtedness and Credit Agreement (Continued) 

 Credit Facility  

        The Company has a senior secured credit facility that consists of a $1,175,000 revolving credit facility and two term loans. Borrowings
under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum between LIBOR plus 3.25% and LIBOR plus 3.75% if the Company chooses to make LIBOR borrowings, or between Citibank's base rate
plus 2.25% and Citibank's base rate plus 2.75%, in each case based upon the amount of revolver availability, as defined in the senior secured credit facility. The Company is required to pay fees
between 0.50% and 0.75% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver depending on the amount of revolver availability. Amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on
August 19, 2015, provided that such maturity date shall instead be April 18, 2014 in the event that on or prior to April 18, 2014 the Company does not
repay, refinance or otherwise extend the maturity date of its Tranche 2 Term Loan (as defined below) to a date that is at least 90 days after August 19, 2015 and, in the case of a
repayment or refinancing, the Company must have at least $500,000 of availability under the revolver. 
        The
Company's ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files. At March 3, 2012,
the Company had $136,000 of borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding thereunder of $128,190 which gave the Company additional borrowing capacity of $910,810. 
        The
credit facility also includes a $1,044,433 senior secured term loan (the "Tranche 2 Term Loan"). The Tranche 2 Term Loan will mature on June 4, 2014 and
currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%, if the Company elects LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank's base rate plus 0.75%. Mandatory prepayments are required to be made
from proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events (subject to certain limitations), a portion of excess cash flows (as defined in the senior secured credit facility) and proceeds from certain
issuances of equity or debt (subject to certain exceptions). If at any time there is a shortfall in the borrowing base under the senior secured credit facility, prepayment of the Tranche 2 Term
Loan may also be required. 
        On
March 3, 2011, the Company refinanced its Tranche 3 Term Loan with a $331,879 senior secured term loan (the "Tranche 5 Term Loan"). The Tranche 5 Term Loan
matures on March 3, 2018, although the maturity will instead be September 16, 2015, in the event that the Company does not repay or refinance its outstanding 9.375% senior notes due 2015
prior to that time. The Tranche 5 Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.25% with a 1.25% LIBOR floor, and is subject to a 1% prepayment fee in the event it is
refinanced within the first year after issuance with the proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance of new loans or other indebtedness incurred for the primary purpose of repaying, refinancing or
replacing the Tranche 5 Term Loan. The Company must make mandatory prepayments of the Tranche 5 Term Loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events (subject to certain
limitations), with a portion of excess cash flow generated by the Company (as defined in the senior secured credit facility) and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt (subject to
certain exceptions). If at any time there is a shortfall in its borrowing base under its senior secured credit facility, prepayment of the Tranche 5 Term Loan may also be required. In
connection with the Tranche 3 Term Loan repayment and retirement, the Company recorded a loss

on
debt modification of $22,434 due to the write off of debt issue costs of $2,716 and unamortized original issue discount of $19,718. 
        The
senior secured credit facility also restricts the Company and the subsidiary guarantors from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200,000 at any time when revolving loans are
outstanding (not
including cash located in the Company's store deposit accounts, cash necessary to cover the Company's current liabilities and certain other exceptions) and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver
borrowings in excess of $100,000 over three consecutive business days. The senior secured credit facility also states that if at any time (other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration
of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt) either
(a) an event of default exists under the Company's senior secured credit facility or (b) the sum of revolver availability under the Company's senior secured credit facility and certain
amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than $100,000 for three consecutive business days (a "cash sweep period"), the funds in the Company's
deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility, and
then held as Collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of the Company's senior secured credit facility. 
        The
senior secured credit facility allows the Company to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1,500,000 in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings
under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750,000 of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled
payments of principal prior to three months after June 4, 2014. The senior secured credit facility allows the Company to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond three
months after June 4, 2014; however, other debentures limit the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said
debt. The senior secured facility also allows, so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default, for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before June 4, 2014, for the
voluntary repurchase of debt with a maturity after June 4, 2014, and the mandatory repurchase of the Company's 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 if the Company maintains availability on the
revolving credit facility of more than $100,000. 
        The
senior secured credit facility contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above, the payments of dividends, sale of
assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens. The credit facility has a financial covenant, which is the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenant requires that, if
availability on the revolving credit facility is less than $150,000, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.05 to 1.00. As of March 3, 2012, the Company was in
compliance with this financial covenant. 
        The
senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy. It is also an event of default if the
Company fails to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of $50,000 or any event occurs that enables, or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would
enable, the

holder
of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt. The August 2010 amendments to the senior secured credit facility exclude the mandatory repurchase of the 8.5%
convertible notes due 2015 from this event of default. 
        Substantially
all of Rite Aid Corporation's 100 percent owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility. The subsidiary guarantees of the
senior secured credit facility; the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016 and the 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020 are secured by a senior lien on, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory
and prescription files of the subsidiary guarantors. Rite Aid Corporation is a holding company with no direct operations and is dependent upon dividends, distributions and other payments from its
subsidiaries to service payments due under the senior secured credit facility. The Company's 10.375% senior secured notes due 2016, the 7.5% senior secured notes due 2017 and the 10.25% senior secured
notes due 2019 are secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral that secures the senior secured credit facility, the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016 and the 8.00% senior secured notes
due 2020. The 8.625% senior notes due 2015, the 9.375% senior notes due 2015 and the 9.5% senior notes due 2017 are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's 100 percent owned
subsidiaries on an unsecured basis. 
        The
subsidiary guarantees related to the Company's senior secured credit facility and secured guaranteed notes and, on an unsecured basis, the unsecured guaranteed notes are full and
unconditional and joint and several, and there are no restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its subsidiaries. Also, the Company has no independent assets or operations, and
subsidiaries not guaranteeing the credit facility and applicable notes are minor. Accordingly, condensed consolidating financial information for the Company and subsidiaries is not presented. 
        The
indentures that govern the Company's secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by the
Company. As of March 3, 2012, the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that could be incurred under these indentures was $1,006,200 (which does not include the ability to enter into
certain sale and leaseback transactions.) However, the Company could not incur any additional secured debt assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit. The ability to issue
additional unsecured debt under these indentures is governed by an interest coverage ratio test. 
 Other 2012 Transactions  
        On February 14, 2012, the Company issued $481,000 of its 9.25% senior notes due March 2020. These notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company's
obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated basis, by all of its subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under its senior
secured credit facility and its unsecured outstanding 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020, 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016, 10.375% senior secured notes due 2016, 7.5% senior secured notes due
2017, 10.25% senior secured notes due 2019, 9.375% senior notes due 2015 and 9.5% senior notes due 2017. The proceeds of the notes, together with available cash, were used to repurchase and repay the
8.625% senior notes due March 2015. In February 2012, the Company completed a tender offer for the 8.625% notes in which

$404,844
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 8.625% notes were tendered and repurchased by the Company. In February 2012, the Company called for the redemption of the remaining 8.625% notes.
The Company satisfied and discharged the remaining 8.625% notes on March 14, 2012 for $55,644, which included the call premium and interest through the call date. The refinancing resulted in a
loss for the period of $16,066. 
        During
August 2011, the Company repurchased $41,000 of its 8.625% senior notes due March 2015, $5,000 of its 9.375% senior notes due December 2015 and $4,496 of its 6.875% senior
debentures due August 2013. These repurchases resulted in a gain for the period of $4,924. 
        On
March 1, 2011, the Company was notified by the NYSE that, as of March 1, 2011, it had regained compliance with the NYSE minimum share price listing requirement. The
Company is now in compliance with all NYSE listing rules, and has actively been taking steps to maintain its listing and expects its efforts to maintain its NYSE listing will be successful. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance with the NYSE minimum share price rule or other continued listing requirements. In the event of a delisting, all holders of its
$64,188 of outstanding 8.5% Convertible Notes due May 2015 ("Convertible Notes") would be entitled to require the Company to repurchase its Convertible Notes. The Company's senior secured credit
facility permits the Company to make such a repurchase of the Convertible Notes; provided that, before and after such transaction, no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing
under the senior secured credit facility and the Company has at least $100,000 of availability under its revolving credit facility. The Company's ability to pay cash to holders of the Convertible
Notes may be limited by its financial resources at the time of such repurchase. The Company cannot assure you that sufficient financing will be available on terms acceptable to it if necessary to make
any required repurchase of the Convertible Notes. 
 2011 Transactions  
        In August 2010, the Company issued $650,000 of 8.00% senior secured notes due August 15, 2020. These notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company's obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject
to certain limitations, by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility and the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016. These guarantees are shared, on a
senior basis, with debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016. The indenture that governs the 8.00% notes contains covenant provisions that,
among other things, allow the holders of the notes to participate along with the term loan holders and holders of the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016 in the mandatory prepayments resulting from
the proceeds of certain asset dispositions (at the option of the noteholder) and include limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur
debt, grant liens, sell assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. 
        In
July 2010, the Company repurchased $93,812 of its $158,000 outstanding 8.5% convertible notes. The Company's remaining 8.5% convertible notes require that the Company maintains a
listing on the NYSE or certain other exchanges. In the event of a NYSE delisting, holders of these notes could

require
the Company to repurchase them, which the Company has the ability to do under the terms of our senior credit facility. On July 30, 2010, the Company received a notice of
non-compliance from the NYSE because the price of its common stock had fallen below the NYSE's minimum share price rule. The Company's common stock continued to trade as usual on the NYSE
and on March 1, 2011, the Company received notice that it had regained compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price listing requirement. The Company is currently in compliance with all NYSE
listing rules. 
 2010 Transactions  
        In October 2009, the Company issued $270,000 of 10.25% senior secured notes due October 15, 2019. These notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company's obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject
to certain limitations, by the same
subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility and the 9.75% senior secured notes due 2016. The guarantees are secured by shared second priority liens with
holders of the 10.375% senior secured notes due 2016 and 7.5% senior secured notes due 2017. The indenture that governs the 10.25% notes contains covenant provisions that, among other things, include
limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur debt, grant liens, sell assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. The
10.25% senior secured notes due October 2019 were issued at 99.2% of par. 
        In
June 2009, the Company issued $410,000 of 9.75% senior secured notes due June 12, 2016. These notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank
equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company's obligations under these notes are guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, by the same subsidiaries that
guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility and its 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020. These guarantees are shared, on a senior basis, with debt outstanding under the senior
secured credit facility and its 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020. The indenture that governs the 9.75% notes and its 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020 contains covenant provisions that, among
other things, allow the holders of the notes to participate along with the holders of the 8.00% senior secured notes due 2020 in the mandatory prepayments resulting from the proceeds of certain asset
dispositions (at the option of the noteholder) and include limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, incur debt, grant liens, sell assets
and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. The 9.75% senior secured notes due June 2016 were issued at 98.2% of par. 

 Interest Rates and Maturities  

        The annual weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness was 7.4%, 7.5%, and 6.8% for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010,
respectively. 
        The
aggregate annual principal payments of long-term debt for the five succeeding fiscal years are as follows: 2013$59,445; 2014$189,316;
2015$1,044,692; 2016$608,617 and $4,340,708 in 2017 and thereafter.

 10. Leases  

        The Company leases most of its retail stores and certain distribution facilities under noncancellable operating and capital leases, most of which have initial lease terms ranging from 5
to 22 years. The Company also leases certain of its equipment and other assets under noncancellable operating leases with initial terms ranging from 3 to 22 years. In addition to minimum
rental payments, certain store leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursements for taxes, maintenance and insurance. Most leases contain renewal options, certain of
which involve rent increases. Total rental expense, net of sublease income of $8,866, $9,662, and $11,027, was $976,892, $965,665 and $961,519 in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These
amounts include contingent rentals of $22,659, $23,336 and $27,260 in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 
        During
fiscal 2012 the Company sold two owned operating stores to independent third parties. Net proceeds from the sale were $6,038. Concurrent with these sales, the Company entered into
agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over a minimum lease terms of 7 to10 years. The Company accounted for these leases as operating leases. The transactions resulted in a
loss of $3,896 which is included in the gain on sale of assets, net for the fifty-three weeks ended March 3, 2012. 
        During
fiscal 2011, the Company had no sale-leaseback transactions. 
        During
fiscal 2010, the Company sold a total of 3 owned properties to independent third parties. Net proceeds from these sales were $7,967. Concurrent with these sales, the Company
entered into agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of 10 to 20 years. The Company accounted for all of these leases as operating leases. A gain on the
sale of these stores of $5,301 was deferred and is being recorded over the minimum term of these leases.

 11. Redeemable Preferred Stock  

        In March 1999 and February 1999, Rite Aid Lease Management Company, a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the Company, issued 63,000 and 150,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock,
Class A, par value $100 per share, respectively. The Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable on April 1, 2019 at a redemption price of $100 per share plus
accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock pays dividends quarterly at a rate of 7.0% per annum of the par value of $100 per share when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors of Rite Aid Lease Management Company in its sole discretion. The amount of dividends payable in respect of the Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock may be adjusted under
certain events. The outstanding shares of the Class A Preferred Stock were recorded at their estimated fair value of $19,253 for the fiscal 2000 issuances, which equaled the sale price on the
date of issuance. Because the fair value of the Class A Preferred Stock was less than the mandatory redemption amount at issuance, periodic accretions to expense using the interest method are
made so that the carrying amount equals the redemption amount on the mandatory redemption date. Accretion was $102 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. The amount of this instrument is $20,583 and $20,481
and is recorded in Other Non-Current Liabilities as of March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011, respectively. 
 12. Capital Stock  

        As of March 3, 2012, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,500,000 shares of common stock and 20,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of
$1.00 per share. Preferred stock is issued in series, subject to terms established by the Board of Directors. 
        The
Company has outstanding Series G and Series H preferred stock. The Series G preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share and pays quarterly
dividends at 7% of liquidation preference. In the fourth quarter of 2009, at the election of the holder, substantially all of the Series G

 13. Stock Option and Stock Award Plans  

        The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, "CompensationStock Compensation." Expense is recognized over the requisite service period
of the award, net of an estimate for the impact of forfeitures. Operating results for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 include $15,861, $17,336 and $23,794 of compensation costs related to the Company's
stock-based compensation arrangements. 
        The
Company reserved 22,000 shares of its common stock for the granting of stock options and other incentive awards to officers and key associates under the 1990 Omnibus Stock Incentive
Plan (the 1990 Plan), which was approved by the shareholders. Options may be granted, with or without stock appreciation rights ("SAR"), at prices that are not less than the fair market value of a
share of common stock on the date of grant. The exercise of either a SAR or option automatically will cancel any related option or SAR. Under the 1990 Plan, the payment for SARs will be made in
shares, cash or a combination of cash and shares at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
        In
November 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan), under which 10,000 shares of common stock are authorized for the granting of stock options at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. 
        In

        In
June 2010, the stockholders of Rite Aid Corporation approved the adoption of the Rite Aid Corporation 2010 Omnibus Equity Plan. Under the plan, 35,000 shares of Rite Aid common stock
are available for granting of restricted stock, stock options, phantom stock, stock bonus awards and other equity based awards at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The adoption of the 2010
Omnibus Equity Plan became effective on June 23, 2010. 
        All
of the plans provide for the Board of Directors (or at its election, the Compensation Committee) to determine both when and in what manner options may be exercised; however, it may
not be more than 10 years from the date of grant. All of the plans provide that stock options may be granted at prices that are not less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on
the date of grant. The aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance for all plans is 89,446 as of March 3, 2012. 
 Stock Options  
        The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010:

(2)The
dividend rate that will be paid out on the underlying shares during the expected term of the options. The Company does not pay dividends on its common
stock, as such, the dividend rate will always be zero percent.
(3)The
risk free interest rate is equal to the rate available on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues as of the grant date of the option with
a remaining term equal to the expected term.
(4)The
period of time for which the option is expected to be outstanding. The Company analyzed employees for exercise behavior.

        As
of March 3, 2012, there was $20,136 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation costs related to unvested stock options, net of forfeitures. These costs are expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.47 years. 
        On
March 21, 2011, the Company launched a Stock Option Exchange Program ("Program") for eligible associates only. Under the Program, eligible associates had the opportunity to
surrender certain stock options for a lesser number of new stock options with an exercise price that was determined based on the closing market price on April 21, 2011, the day the Program
concluded. The number of new options was determined by applying exchange ratios that resulted in providing new stock options with an aggregate fair value that approximated the aggregate fair value of
the options they replaced. The new options vest over two years and have a five year life with an exercise price of $1.03. A total of 14.0 million options with an average exercise price in
excess of $1.77 were cancelled and 5.3 million new options were granted with an exercise price of $1.03. The Company recognized a minimal incremental compensation expense as a result of the
Program.

 14. Retirement Plans  

 Defined Contribution Plans  

        The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor several retirement plans that are primarily 401(k) defined contribution plans covering
nonunion associates and certain union associates. The Company does not contribute to all of the plans. In accordance with those plan provisions, the Company matches 100% of a participant's pretax
payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 3% of such participant's pretax annual compensation. Thereafter, the Company will match 50% of the participant's additional pretax payroll contributions, up
to a maximum of 2% of such participant's additional pretax annual compensation. Total expense recognized for the above plans was $57,036 in fiscal 2012, $58,035 in fiscal 2011 and $59,531 in fiscal
2010. 
        The
Chairman of the Board is entitled to supplemental retirement defined contribution arrangements in accordance with her employment agreement, which vests immediately. The Company makes
investments to fund this obligation. Other officers, who are not participating in the defined benefit nonqualified executive retirement plan, are included in a supplemental retirement plan, which is a
defined contribution plan that is subject to a five year graduated vesting schedule. The expense recognized for these plans was $4,582 in fiscal 2012, $9,433 in fiscal 2011, and $10,989 in fiscal
2010. 

 Defined Benefit Plans  

        The Company and its subsidiaries also sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan that requires benefits to be paid to eligible
associates based upon years of service and, in some cases, eligible compensation. The Company's funding policy for The Rite Aid Pension Plan (The "Defined Benefit Pension Plan") is to contribute the
minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, the Company may, at its sole discretion, contribute additional funds to the plan. The Company made
contributions of $14,878 in fiscal 2012, $13,451 in fiscal 2011, and $2,681 in fiscal 2010. 
        The
Company has established the nonqualified executive retirement plan for certain officers who, pursuant to their employment agreements, are not participating in the defined
contribution supplemental retirement plan. Generally, eligible participants receive an annual benefit, payable monthly over fifteen years, equal to a percentage of the average of the three highest
annual base salaries paid or accrued for each participant within the ten fiscal years prior to the date of the event giving rise to payment of the benefit. This defined benefit plan is unfunded.

        To
develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset
class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 7.75% long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for fiscal 2012, 2011
and 2010. 
        The
Company's pension plan asset allocations at March 3, 2012 and February 26, 2011 by asset category were as follows:

        The
investment objectives of the Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the only defined benefit plan with assets, are to:


Achieve a rate of return on investments that exceeds inflation over a full market cycle and is consistent with actuarial
assumptions; 
Balance the correlation between assets and liabilities by diversifying the portfolio among various asset classes to
address return risk and interest rate risk;

Balance the allocation of assets between the investment managers to minimize concentration risk;  
Maintain liquidity in the portfolio sufficient to meet plan obligations as they come due; and  
Control administrative and management costs. 

        The
asset allocation established for the pension investment program reflects the risk tolerance of the Company, as determined by:


the current and anticipated financial strength of the Company; 
the funded status of the plan; and 
plan liabilities. 

        Investments
in both the equity and fixed income markets will be maintained, recognizing that historical results indicate that equities (primarily common stocks) have higher expected
returns than fixed income investments. It is also recognized that the correlation between assets and liabilities must be balanced to address higher volatility of equity investments (return risk) and
interest rate risk. 
        The
following targets are to be applied to the allocation of plan assets.

 Other Plans  

        The Company participates in various multi-employer union pension plans that are not sponsored by the Company. Total expenses recognized
for the multi-employer plans were $14,594 in fiscal 2012, $19,053 in fiscal 2011 and $19,328 in fiscal 2010. 
 15. Multiemployer Plans that Provide Pension Benefits  

        The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented
employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide
benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating
employers. Additionally, if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of
the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
        The
Company's participation in these plans for the annual period ended March 3, 2012 is outlined in the table below. The "EIN/Pension Plan Number" column provides the Employer
Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. The most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 is for the plan year-ends
as indicated below. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally
less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The "FIP/RP Status
Pending/Implemented" column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan
contributions, the Company may be subject to a surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The
"Surcharge Imposed" column indicates whether a surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last two columns list the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining

 Legal Proceedings  

        While the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, the Company does not
believe that any of these matters will have a material effect on its business or financial condition. The Company cannot give assurance, however, that an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these
matters will not have a material effect on its results of operations for the period in which they are resolved. 
        The
Company is currently a defendant in several putative collective or class action lawsuits filed in federal or state courts in several states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New
York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Washington and Oregon, purportedly on behalf of, in some cases (i) current and former assistant store managers and co-managers or
(ii) current and former store managers and assistant store managers, respectively, working in the Company's stores at various locations. The lawsuits allege violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and of certain state wage and hour statutes. The lawsuits seek various combinations of unpaid compensation (including overtime compensation), liquidated damages, exemplary damages,
pre-and post-judgment interest as well as attorneys' fees and costs. In one of the cases, Craig et al v. Rite Aid Corporation et al, pending in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, brought on behalf of current and former assistant store managers, the Court, on December 9, 2009, conditionally certified a
nationwide collective group of individuals who worked for the Company as assistant store managers since December 9, 2006. Notice of the Craig
action was sent to the purported members of the collective group (approximately 6,700 current and former assistant store managers) and approximately 1,100

joined
the Craig action. The Company has filed a motion to decertify the class which is presently pending. In another of the cases,  Indergit v. Rite Aid Corporation et al, pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, brought on behalf of current
and former store managers, the Court, on April 2, 2010, conditionally certified a nationwide collective group of individuals who worked for the Company as store managers since March 31,
2007. The Court ordered that Notice of the Indergit action be sent to the purported members of the collective group (approximately 7,000 current and
former store managers) and approximately 1,550 joined the Indergit action. In another of the cases, Ibea v. Rite Aid Corporation
et al, pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, brought on behalf of former salaried co-managers, the Court, on January 9,
2012, conditionally certified a collective group of individuals who worked for the Company as salaried co-managers. The Court ordered that Notice of the  Ibea action be sent to the purported members of
the collective group (approximately 650 former salaried co-managers) and approximately 140 joined the  Ibea action. At this time, the Company is not able to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or any
possible monetary exposure associated with the
lawsuits. The Company's management believes, however, that the lawsuits are without merit and not appropriate for collective or class action treatment. The Company is vigorously defending all of these
claims. 
        The
Company is currently a defendant in several putative class action lawsuits filed in state courts in California alleging violations of California wage and hour laws, rules and
regulations pertaining primarily to pay for missed meals and rest periods and failure to provide employee seating. These suits purport to be class actions and seek substantial damages. At this time,
the Company is not able to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuits. The Company's management believes, however, that the plaintiffs'
allegations are without merit and that their claims are not appropriate for class action treatment. The Company is vigorously defending all of these claims. 
        The
Company was served with a United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") subpoena dated March 5, 2010 in connection with an
investigation being conducted by the OIG, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the United States Department of Justice Commercial Litigation Branch. The
subpoena requests records related to any gift card or similar programs for customers who transferred prescriptions for drugs or medicines to the Company's pharmacies, and whether any customers who
receive federally funded prescription benefits (e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) may have benefited from those programs. The Company is in the process of completing its production of records in
response to the subpoena and is unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the government of such information. 
        The
Company received a subpoena dated May 9, 2011 from certain California counties seeking information regarding compliance with environmental regulations governing the management
of hazardous waste. The Company is completing its production of records in response to the subpoena. The Company is unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the
government of such information.

        The
Company was served with a Civil Investigative Demand Subpoena Duces Tecum dated August 26, 2011 by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
The subpoena requests records regarding the relationship of Rite Aid's Rx Savings Program to the reporting of usual and customary charges to publicly funded health programs. The Company is in the
process of communicating with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding the scope of the subpoena and is unable to predict with certainty the timing or outcome of any review by the government of such
information. 
        The
Company is subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the Company's management
cannot predict the outcome of these claims with certainty, the Company's management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material effect on its financial
statements. 

 Contingencies:  

        The California Department of Health Care Services ("DHCS"), the agency responsible for administering the State of California Medicaid
program, recently implemented retroactive reimbursement rate reductions impacting the medical provider community in California, including pharmacies. Numerous medical providers, including
representatives of both chain and independent pharmacies, filed suits against DHCS in federal district court in California and have obtained preliminary injunctions against the rate cuts, subject to a
trial on the merits. DHCS is appealing the preliminary injunctions to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Based upon the actions of DHCS, the Company has recorded the appropriate accrual, which is not
material. As pertinent facts and circumstances develop, these accruals may be adjusted.

        As
of March 3, 2012, the Jean Coutu Group owned 234,401,162 shares (25.2% of the voting power of the Company) of common stock. On April 20, 2012, the Jean Coutu Group
announced that it had disposed of 56,000,000 of its 234,401,162 shares of Rite Aid's common stock. As a result of such sale,
the Jean Coutu Group was required to cause one of its designees to immediately resign from Rite Aid's board of directors and Andre Belzile resigned from Rite Aid's board of directors effective
April 23, 2012. Following Mr. Belzile's resignation and reduction of the size of Rite Aid's board of directors from eleven to ten members, the Jean Coutu Group will continue to have the
right to designate two members of Rite Aid's board of directors, subject to adjustment for future reductions in its ownership position in the Company. In addition, upon such sale, certain rights of
Jean Coutu Group to maintain their ownership percentage in Rite Aid and the requirement that two-thirds of Rite Aid's board of directors approve certain transactions terminated.

fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company paid Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., fees of $38, $163 and $150 for financial advisory services and expense reimbursements of

        The
following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments: 

 LIBOR-based borrowings under credit facilities:  

        The carrying amounts for LIBOR-based borrowings under the credit facilities, term loans and term notes are estimated based on the
quoted market price of the financial instruments. 

 Long-term indebtedness:  

        The fair values of long-term indebtedness are estimated based on the quoted market prices of the financial instruments. If
quoted market prices were not available, the Company estimated the fair value based on the quoted market price of a financial instrument with similar characteristics.
