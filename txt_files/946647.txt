PART I 
 


Item 1.
Business 
First Defiance Financial Corp. (First Defiance or the Company) is a unitary thrift holding company
that, through its subsidiaries, First Federal Bank of the Midwest (First Federal) and First Insurance Group of the Midwest, Inc., formerly known as First Insurance and Investments, Inc. (First Insurance) (collectively,
the Subsidiaries), focuses on traditional banking and property and casualty and life and group health insurance products. The Companys banking activities include originating and servicing residential, commercial, and consumer loans
and providing a broad range of depository services. The Companys insurance activities consist primarily of commissions relating to the sale of property and casualty and life and group health insurance products. 
The Companys philosophy is to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high
ethical standards and safe and sound assets. The Company operates as a locally oriented, community-based financial services organization, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select critical areas. The Companys local market
orientation is reflected in its market area management and local advisory boards, which are comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives that assist area management in responding to local banking needs.
 The Companys operating objectives include expansion, diversification within its markets, growth of its
fee-based income and growth internally and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches and financial services businesses. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and
possess either significant market area presence or have the potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and
conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash,
debt or equity securities may occur. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in any future
transaction.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had consolidated assets of $2.07 billion, consolidated
deposits of $1.60 billion, and consolidated stockholders equity of $278.1 million. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in June of 1995. Its principal executive offices are located at 601 N. Clinton Street, Defiance, Ohio 43512, and its
telephone number is (419) 782-5015.  First Defiances website, www.fdef.com contains a hyperlink
under the Investor Relations section to EDGAR where the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after First Defiance has filed the report with the SEC.  The Subsidiaries  The Companys core business operations are conducted
through the Subsidiaries:  First Federal Bank of the Midwest: First Federal is a
federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Defiance, Ohio. It conducts operations through 26 full service banking center offices in Allen, Defiance, Fulton, Hancock, Henry, Lucas, Ottawa, Paulding, Putnam, Seneca, Williams and Wood
counties in northwest Ohio, 1 full service banking center office in Allen county in northeast Indiana and 6 full service banking center offices in Lenawee county in southeast Michigan.

Table of Contents
On March 14, 2008, First Defiance completed the acquisition of
Pavilion Bancorp, Inc (Pavilion) and its subsidiary, Bank of Lenawee. That acquisition added eight banking branch offices located in Lenawee and Hillsdale counties in Michigan. The one branch in Hillsdale county that was acquired in the
Pavilion acquisition was closed in January 2010. On January 21, 2005, First Defiance completed the acquisition of ComBanc, Inc. (ComBanc) and its subsidiary, the Commercial Bank, Delphos, Ohio. That acquisition added four branch
offices located in Allen County, Ohio, which is adjacent to First Defiances existing footprint. On April 8, 2005, First Defiance completed the acquisition of the Genoa Savings and Loan Company, (Genoa) which added three
offices in the metropolitan Toledo, Ohio area.  First Federal is primarily engaged in community banking. It
attracts deposits from the general public through its offices and uses those and other available sources of funds to originate residential real estate loans, non-residential real estate loans, commercial loans, home improvement and home equity loans
and consumer loans. In addition, First Federal invests in U.S. Treasury and federal government agency obligations, obligations of the State of Ohio and its political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities which are issued by federal agencies,
including real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and corporate bonds. First Federals deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC). First Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System. 
First Insurance Group: First Insurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of First Defiance. First Insurance is an
insurance agency that conducts business in the Defiance, Archbold, Maumee, Oregon, Bryan and Bowling Green, Ohio areas. First Insurance offers property and casualty insurance, life insurance and group health insurance. On July 1, 2011 First
Insurance acquired Payak-Dubbs Insurance Agency, Inc. (PDI) headquartered in Maumee and Oregon, Ohio. In May 2010, First Insurance acquired a group medical benefits business line from Andres ONeil & Lowe Insurance Agency.
See Note 4  Acquisitions in the Notes to the financial statements for additional information.  Securities 
First Defiances securities portfolio is managed in accordance with a written policy adopted by the Board of
Directors and administered by the Investment Committee. The Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer of First Federal can each approve transactions up to $3 million. Two of the three officers are
required to approve transactions between $3 million and $5 million. All transactions in excess of $5 million must be approved by the Board of Directors. 
First Defiances investment portfolio includes 45 CMO and REMIC issues totaling $61.9 million, all of which are
fully amortizing securities. Management does not believe the risks associated with any of its CMO or REMIC investments are significantly different from risks associated with other pass-through mortgage-backed securities. First Defiance did not have
any off-balance sheet derivative securities at December 31, 2011.  Management determines the appropriate
classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when First Defiance has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at
amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value.

Table of Contents
The carrying value of securities at December 31, 2011 by contractual
maturity is shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed
securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted-average contractual maturities of underlying collateral. The mortgage-backed securities may mature earlier than their
weighted-average contractual maturities because of principal prepayments.

Interest-Bearing Deposits 
The Company had $143.0 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010 in overnight investments with the Federal Reserve,
which amount is included in interest-bearing deposits. First Defiance had interest-earning deposits in the FHLB of Cincinnati and other financial institutions amounting to $1.6 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  Residential Loan Servicing Activities 
Servicing mortgage loans for investors involves a contractual right to receive a fee for processing and administering loan
payments on mortgage loans that are not owned by the Company and are not included on the Companys balance sheet. This processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on
a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers. At December 31, 2011, First Federal serviced 13,576 loans
totaling $1.27 billion. The vast majority of the loans serviced for others are fixed rate conventional mortgage loans. The Company primarily sells its loans to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB. In 2011, 58.54%, 38.89% and 2.45% of the Companys
sold loans were to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB, respectively.  As compensation for its mortgage servicing
activities, the Company receives servicing fees, usually 0.25% per annum of the loan balances serviced, plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided. In the event of a default by
the borrower, the Company receives no servicing fees until the default is cured.  The following table sets
forth certain information regarding the number and aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans serviced by the Company, including both fixed and adjustable rate loans, at various interest rates:

 Lending Activities  General  A savings bank generally may not make loans to one borrower and related entities in an amount which exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and
surplus, although loans in an amount equal to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus may be made to a borrower if the loans are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Real estate is not considered readily marketable
collateral. Certain types of loans are not subject to these limits. In applying these limits, loans to certain borrowers may be aggregated. Notwithstanding the specified limits, a savings bank may lend to one borrower up to $500,000 for
any purpose. At December 31, 2011, First Federals limit on loans-to-one borrower was $39.8 million and its five largest loans (including available lines of credit) or groups of loans to one borrower, including related entities, were
$28.1 million, $20.9 million, $19.4 million, $19.2 million and $16.5 million. All of these loans or groups of loans were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2011. 
Loan Portfolio Composition  The net increase or (decrease) in net loans
receivable over the prior year was ($24.6 million), ($102.2 million) and ($12.1 million) in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans. The Companys loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its
northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration. Total loans for income generating property totaled $373.6 million at
December 31, 2011, which represents 26% of the Companys loan portfolio.  The following table sets
forth the composition of the Companys loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.

 The schedule above does not reflect the actual life of the Companys loan portfolio.
The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and due-on-sale clauses, which give First Defiance the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other
things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.

 Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
 The lending activities of First Federal are subject to the written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained
from a variety of sources, including referrals from existing customers, real estate brokers, developers and builders, newspaper and radio advertising and walk-in customers. 
First Federals loan approval process for all types of loans is intended to assess the borrowers ability to
repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan.  A commercial loan application is first reviewed and underwritten by one of the commercial loan officers, who may approve credits within their lending limit. Another loan officer with limits sufficient to
cover the exposure must approve credits exceeding an individuals lending limit. All credits which exceed $100,000 in aggregate exposure must be presented for review or approval to the Senior Loan Committee comprised of senior lending
personnel. Credits which exceed $1,000,000 in aggregate exposure must be presented for approval to the Executive Loan Committee, a committee of First Federals Board of Directors. 
Residential mortgage applications are accepted by retail lenders or branch managers, who utilize an automated
underwriting system to review the loan request. First Federal also receives mortgage applications via an online residential mortgage origination system. A final approval of all residential mortgage applications is made by a member of a centralized
underwriting staff within their designated lending limits. Loan requests in excess or outside an individual underwriters limit are approved by the Senior Loan Committee and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee. 
Retail lenders and branch managers are authorized to originate and approve direct consumer loan requests that are within
policy guidelines and within the lenders approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the lenders approved lending limit may be approved by retail lending managers up to their approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the retail lending
managers authorized lending limit or outside of policy must be approved by Senior Loan Committee and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee. Indirect consumer loans originated by auto dealers are underwritten and approved by a
designated underwriter in accordance with company policy and lending limits.  First Defiance offers
adjustable-rate loans in order to decrease the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. The demand for adjustable-rate loans in First Defiances primary market area has been a function of several factors, including customer
preference, the level of interest rates, the 
  -9-



Table of Contents

expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the interest rates offered for fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate residential loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment.  Adjustable-rate loans represented 5.4% of First Defiances total originations of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in 2011 compared to 6.6% and 1.4% during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates, but involve other risks,
primarily because as interest rates rise, the payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, thereby increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be
adversely affected by higher interest rates.  The following table shows total loans originated, loan
reductions, and the net increase in First Defiances total loans and loans held for sale during the periods indicated:

 Asset Quality  First Defiances credit policy establishes guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality. These guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to ensure sound credit
decisions. First Defiances credit policies and review procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending. In following the policies and procedures, management must rely on estimates, appraisals and evaluations of

 Overall, the level of delinquencies at December 31, 2011 has decreased from the
levels at December 31, 2010, when First Defiance reported that 3.41% of its outstanding loans were at least 30 days delinquent. The level of total loans 90 or more days delinquent has decreased to 2.66% at December 31, 2011 from 2.68% at
December 31, 2010. The level of total loans 60-89 days delinquent has decreased to 0.09% at December 31, 2011 from 0.36% at December 31, 2010. Overall, the level of loans that were 30 to 59 days past due past due increased from 0.37%
at December 31, 2010 to 0.51% at December 31, 2011. Management has assessed the collectability of all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent as part of its procedures in establishing the allowance for loan losses. 
Nonperforming Assets  All loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are
placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collectability of additional interest is deemed insufficient to warrant further accrual. Generally, First Defiance places all loans more than 90 days past due on non-accrual
status. First Defiance also places loans on non-accrual when the loan is paying as agreed but the Company believes the financial condition of the borrower is such that this classification is warranted. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status,
total unpaid interest accrued to date is reversed. Subsequent payments are generally applied to the outstanding principal balance but may be recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan. First
Defiance considers that a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. First
Defiance measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. If
the estimated recoverability of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment, First Defiance will recognize impairment by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses. 
Impaired loans acquired in the ComBanc, Genoa and Pavilion acquisitions have been accounted for under the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Such loans were recorded at their fair value, which was estimated based on the expected cash flow of the acquired loan. In the Genoa
acquisition, 10 loan relationships with a stated value of $1.5 million were recorded at $721,000. In the ComBanc acquisition, 12 loan relationships with a stated value of $3.4 million were recorded at $2.0 million. In the Pavilion acquisition, 12
loan relationships with a stated value of $6.4 million were recorded at $4.4 million. Of all these impaired loans that were acquired in an acquisition, as of December 31, 2011, 11 loan relationships remained with

  -11-

a contractual balance of $2.2 million and were recorded at $1.2 million. If managements expectations about the cash flow of those loans changes over time, the difference will be recognized
as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the respective loan. In 2011, $33,000 of impairment was recognized as a yield adjustment. There were no significant changes in the expected cash flows of the remaining loan relationships in 2011.
 Loans originated by First Federal having principal balances of $47.9 million, $70.9 million and $58.8 million
were considered impaired as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts exclude large groups of small-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as residential mortgage, consumer
installment and credit card loans. There was $1.6 million of interest received and recorded in income during 2011 related to impaired loans. There was $2.0 million and $913,000 recorded in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Unrecorded interest income
based on the loans contractual terms on these impaired loans and all non-performing loans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2.3 million, $2.0 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2011,
2010 and 2009 (excluding loans accounted for under Topic 310 Subtopic 30) was $61.0 million, $64.4 million and $38.9 million, respectively. The total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was $7.2 million, $16.6 million, and $12.2 million
at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Real estate acquired by foreclosure is classified as
real estate owned until such time as it is sold. First Defiance also repossesses other assets securing loans, consisting primarily of automobiles. When such property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less cost to sell. Costs relating to
development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management and a write-down of the value is recorded with a corresponding charge to
operations if it is determined that the carrying value of property exceeds its estimated net realizable value. During 2011, First Defiance recognized $1.0 million of expense related to write-downs in value of real estate acquired by foreclosure. The
balance of real estate owned at December 31, 2011 was $3.6 million.  As of December 31, 2011, First
Defiances total non-performing loans amounted to $42.7 million or 2.87% of total loans (net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs), compared to $47.0 million or 3.10% of total loans, at December 31, 2010. Non-performing
loans are loans which are more than 90 days past due or on nonaccrual or loans which have been restructured and identified as troubled debt restructurings. The nonperforming loan balance includes $32.4 million of loans originated by First Federal
also considered impaired or acquired loans accounted for under Topic 310 Subtopic 30.  The following table
sets forth the amounts and categories of First Defiances non-performing assets (excluding impaired loans not considered non-performing) and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.

 Total loans are net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs. 
In addition to the $42.7 million of non-performing loans reported above and $15.5 million of loans considered impaired
(including loans accounted for under Topic 310 Subtopic 30), which are not included in the non-performing loans reported above, there are approximately $67.9 million of performing nonresidential real estate and commercial loans where known
information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in the inclusion of such loans in non-performing
loans at some future date. In analyzing these loans for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management has determined that these loans generally have significant collateral, strong guarantors, or both.
 Allowance for Loan Losses  First Defiance maintains an
allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan loss is made up of two components. The first is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous
loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors are primarily the historical loss experience of the portfolio for the most recent weighted two years.
Qualitative factors that may lead the Company to add additional general reserves on the non-impaired loan portfolio include such things as: changes in international, national and local economic business conditions, changes in the value of underlying
collateral for collateral dependent loans, changes in the political and regulatory environment and changes in the trends of the loan portfolio.  The second component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits. In evaluating the adequacy of its
allowance each quarter, management grades all loans in the commercial portfolio. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes

  -13-



Table of Contents

judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. The Company also considers the impacts of any
Small Business Association or Farm Service Agency guarantees. An internal loan review of all loan relationships between $250,000 and $750,000 is performed annually. Management also engages a third-party to do an annual review of all loan
relationships in excess of $750,000. Both of these loan reviews, among other things, independently assess managements loan grades.  Loans charged-off are charged against the allowance when such loans meet the Companys established policy on loan charge-offs and the allowance itself is adjusted quarterly by recording a provision
for loan losses. As such, actual losses and losses provided for should be approximately the same if the overall quality, composition and size of the portfolio remained static. To the extent that the portfolio grows at a rapid rate or overall quality
deteriorates, the provision generally will exceed charge-offs, as happened in 2008 through 2010. However, in certain circumstances, as happened in 2011, net charge-offs may exceed the provision for loan losses when management determines that loans
previously provided for in the allowance for loan losses are uncollectible and should be charged off. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations, future adjustments to the allowances may be
necessary, and net earnings could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
At December 31, 2011, First Defiances allowance for loan losses amounted to $33.3 million compared to $41.1
million at December 31, 2010. The following table sets forth the activity in First Defiances allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated.

Table of Contents
The provision for credit losses, as well as charge-offs, has increased
significantly from 2008 through 2011 due mainly to continued deteriorating national and local economic conditions and the declining values of the underlying collateral of collateral dependent loans. The increase is due to some large relationships in
the commercial real estate and commercial portfolios that were charged off due to the effect of the slowing economy. Management anticipates a lower level of net charge-offs in 2012 compared to 2011 and feels that the level of the allowance for loan
losses at December 31, 2011 is sufficient to cover the estimated losses incurred but not yet recognized in the loan portfolio.  The following table sets forth information concerning the allocation of First Defiances allowance for loan losses by loan categories at the dates indicated. For information about the percent of
total loans in each category to total loans, see Lending Activities-Loan Portfolio Composition.

 Sources of Funds  General  Deposits are the primary source of First Defiances funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, First Defiance
derives funds from loan principal repayments. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB
may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. During 2007, First Defiance issued $15.0 million of trust
preferred securities through an unconsolidated affiliated trust. Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including funding of dividends and stock buybacks as well as bolstering regulatory capital at the First Federal
level. First Defiance also issued $20.0 million of similar trust preferred securities in 2005. 
Deposits  First Defiances deposits are attracted principally from
within First Defiances primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms
vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate.  To supplement its funding needs, First Defiance also utilizes the national market for Certificates of Deposit. Such deposits have maturities ranging from one to thirty-five months. These deposits are
issued at the current rates available to customers in our market areas. The total balance of national certificates of deposit was $10.6 million and $41.8 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 First Defiance borrows funds under a variety of programs at the FHLB. As of
December 31, 2011, there was $81.8 million outstanding under various long-term FHLB advance programs. First Defiance utilizes short-term advances from the FHLB to meet cash flow needs and for short-term

investment purposes. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, no outstanding balances existed under First Defiances Cash Management Advance Line of Credit. The total available
under this line is $15.0 million. Additionally, First Defiance has $100.0 million available under a REPO line of credit. Amounts are generally borrowed under these lines on an overnight basis. First Federals total borrowing capacity at the
FHLB is limited by various collateral requirements. Eligible collateral includes mortgage loans, home equity loans, non-mortgage loans, cash, and investment securities. At December 31, 2011, other than amounts available on the REPO and Cash
Management line, First Federal had additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $147.9 million as a result of these collateral requirements.  As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, First Federal must maintain a minimum investment in the capital stock of that FHLB in an amount defined in the FHLBs regulations. First Federal is permitted to
own stock in excess of the minimum requirement and is in compliance with the minimum requirement with an investment in stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati of $19.3 million at December 31, 2011. First Federal also acquired $2.0 million in stock of
the FHLB of Indianapolis from the Pavilion acquisition, which had a balance of $1.3 million at December 31, 2011. This stock is required to be held for a minimum of five years from the date the stock was acquired by First Federal,
March 14, 2008.  Each FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its
members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a members performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and its record of lending to first-time homebuyers. 
For additional information regarding First Defiances FHLB advances and other debt see Notes 13 and 15 to the
financial statements.  Subordinated Debentures  In March 2007, the Company
sponsored an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust II (Trust Affiliate II) that issued $15 million of Guaranteed Capital Trust Securities (Trust Preferred Securities). In connection with the transaction, the Company issued
$15.5 million of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (Subordinated Debentures) to Trust Affiliate II. Trust Affiliate II was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the
proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate II are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by
Trust Affiliate II are payable quarterly at a fixed rate equal to 6.441% for the first five years and a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.50%, repricing quarterly, thereafter. 
The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the
Subordinated Debentures. The Company has entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on
June 15, 2037, but may be redeemed at the Companys option at any time on or after June 15, 2012, or at any time upon certain events.  In October 2005, the Company formed an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust I (Trust Affiliate I) that issued $20 million of Trust Preferred Securities. In connection with the
transaction, the Company issued $20.6 million of Subordinated Debentures to Trust Affiliate I. Trust Affiliate I was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of
these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate I are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are
payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.38%, or 1.73% as of December 31, 2011. The rate was 1.67% at December 31, 2010.

Table of Contents
The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are subject to
mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company has entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The
Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed by the issuer at par after October 28, 2010. The Subordinated Debentures mature on December 15, 2035. 
Due to the Companys participation in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program, permission must be obtained
from the U.S. Treasury in order to call these securities.  Participation in the Capital Purchase Program 
In December 2008, First Defiance participated in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program (CPP).
Under the CPP, First Defiance issued $37.0 million of First Defiance non-voting preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 550,595 shares of First Defiances common stock at an exercise price of $10.08 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution
and other adjustments. The $37.0 million of preferred stock issued by First Defiance under the CPP qualifies as Tier 1 capital. The cash received from the preferred stock issuance is reflected in the financing activities section of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The general purpose of the funds was to maintain and create lending opportunities in our market area.  Employees  First Defiance had 581 employees at
December 31, 2011. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agent, and First Defiance believes that it maintains good relationships with its personnel.  Competition  Competition in originating non-residential
mortgage and commercial loans comes mainly from commercial banks with banking center offices in the Companys market area. Competition for the origination of mortgage loans arises mainly from savings associations, commercial banks, and mortgage
companies. The distinction among market participants is based on a combination of price, the quality of customer service and name recognition. The Company competes for loans by offering competitive interest rates and product types and by seeking to
provide a higher level of personal service to borrowers than is furnished by competitors. First Federal has a significant market share of the lending markets in which it conducts operations. 
Management believes that First Federals most direct competition for deposits comes from local financial
institutions. The distinction among market participants is based on price and the quality of customer service and name recognition. First Federals cost of funds fluctuates with general market interest rates. During certain interest rate
environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected from corporate and governmental debt securities, as well as from money market mutual funds. First Federal competes for conventional deposits by emphasizing quality of
service, extensive product lines and competitive pricing.

Regulation  General  Provisions of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protections Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) required the transfer of Office of Thrift Supervision functions to the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection on July 21, 2011. As a result, First Defiance and First Federal are
subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. Because the FDIC insures First Federals deposits, First Federal is also subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC. First Defiance and
First Federal must file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and examinations are conducted periodically by the Federal Reserve, OCC and the FDIC to determine whether First Defiance and First Federal are in compliance with various
regulatory requirements and are operating in a safe and sound manner. First Federal is subject to various consumer protection and fair lending laws. These laws govern, among other things, truth-in-lending disclosure, equal credit opportunity, and,
in the case of First Federal, fair credit reporting and community reinvestment. Failure to abide by federal laws and regulations governing community reinvestment could limit the ability of First Federal to open a new branch or engage in a merger
transaction. Community reinvestment regulations evaluate how well and to what extent First Federal lends and invests in its designated service area, with particular emphasis on low-to-moderate income communities and borrowers in such areas.
 First Defiance is also subject to various Ohio laws which restrict takeover bids, tender offers and
control-share acquisitions involving public companies which have significant ties to Ohio.  Regulatory
Capital Requirements  First Federal Bank is required by regulations to meet certain minimum capital requirements. Current capital requirements call for core capital of 4.0% of adjusted total assets, except for associations with the
highest examination rating and acceptable levels of risk, and risk-based capital of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets.  The following table sets forth the amount and percentage level of regulatory capital of First Federal Bank at December 31, 2011, and the amount by which it exceeds the minimum capital requirements.
Tier 1 capital is reflected as a percentage of adjusted total assets. Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total (or risk-based) capital, which consists of core and supplementary capital, is reflected as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.
Assets are weighted at percentage levels ranging from 0% to 100% depending on their relative risk.

Table of Contents
To be categorized as a well-capitalized institution, institutions need to
maintain a tier 1 (core) capital ratio of 5%, a tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, and a risk-based capital ratio of 10%. First Federal Banks capital at December 31, 2011 meets the standards for a well-capitalized
institution. There are no conditions or events since the most recent notification from any of the regulatory agencies regarding those capital standards that management believes have changed any of the well-capitalized categorizations of First
Federal Bank.  Dividends  First Defiances payment of dividends to its shareholders is
generally funded by the payment of dividends by the Subsidiaries. Dividends paid by First Federal to First Defiance are subject to various regulatory restrictions. First Federal can initiate dividend payments equal to its net profits (as defined by
statute) for the current year plus the preceding two calendar years. First Federal is required to receive prior approval from its primary regulator, the OCC, before it can pay any dividends to First Defiance, its parent company. First Federal did
not pay any dividends in 2011 and 2010. As a result of its participation in the CPP, First Defiance is prohibited, without prior approval from the U.S. Treasury, from paying a quarterly cash dividend of more than $0.26 per share until the U.S.
Treasurys preferred stock is redeemed or transferred to an unaffiliated third party.  Transactions
with Insiders and Affiliates  Loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests must conform to the lending limits. Most loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be
approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of board of directors of the association with any interested director not participating. All loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders
must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with the general public or as offered to all employees in a company-wide benefit program. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions. In
addition, all related party transactions must be approved by the Companys audit committee pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5630, including loans made by financial institutions in the ordinary course of business. All transactions between savings
associations and their affiliates must comport with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and the Federal Reserve Boards (FRB) Regulation W. An affiliate of a savings association is any company or entity that controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with the savings association. First Defiance and First Insurance are affiliates of First Federal.  Holding Company Regulation  First Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company and is subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Federal
law generally prohibits a thrift holding company from controlling any other savings association or thrift holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, or from acquiring or retaining more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings
association or holding company thereof, which is not a subsidiary.  Deposit Insurance  First
Federal is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts at First Federal are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000. Further, from December 31, 2010 through
December 31, 2012, deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts will be fully insured by the FDIC regardless of the amount in the account. The Bank has opted to participate in the FDICs Transaction Account Guarantee Program.
See Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program below.  During 2008, there were higher levels of bank
failures which dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, on December 16, 2008, the FDIC issued a final rule that raised the
then current 
  -21-



Table of Contents

assessment rates of insured institutions uniformly by 7 basis points (7 cents for every $100 of deposits), beginning with the first quarter of 2009. Further, beginning April 1, 2009, the
FDIC required higher risk institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposed a special assessment
for the second quarter of 2009 of 5 basis points on each insured depositary institutions assets minus its Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009, which was collected on September 30, 2009 in the amount of $906,000 for First Federal. On
November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The prepaid assessments for
these periods were collected on December 30, 2009, along with the regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, the prepaid assessment rate was based
on each institutions total base assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect for the institution on September 30, 2009, was in effect for the entire third quarter of 2009. As
of December 31, 2011, $2.4 million in prepaid deposit insurance assessments is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the new restoration
plan, the FDIC will maintain the current schedule of assessment rates for all depository institutions. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment
rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.  Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the
FDIC upon finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management
does not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the deposit insurance.  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program  On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced a new program, the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. This program has two components  The Debt
Guarantee Program and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program. The Debt Guarantee Program guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of a participating organization, up to certain limits established for each institution, issued between
October 14, 2008 and June 30, 2009. The FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured failure of the participating entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest in
accordance with the terms of the instrument. The guarantee will remain in effect until June 30, 2012. In return for the FDICs guarantee, participating institutions will pay the FDIC a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. The
Company opted to participate in the Debt Guarantee Program.  The Transaction Account Guarantee Program
provides full deposit insurance coverage for non-interest bearing transaction deposit accounts, regardless of dollar amount, until December 31, 2012, which was extended twice from December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2010, respectively. An
annualized 25 basis point assessment (increased from 10 basis points) on balances in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000 will be assessed on a quarterly basis to insured depository
institutions that have not opted out of this component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Company has opted to participate in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program.

Risk Factors  An investment in the Companys common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Companys business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described
below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties
described below are the not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Companys business operations.
 If any of the following risks actually occur, the Companys financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Companys common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
Economic conditions may adversely affect First Defiances operations and financial condition. 
Local Economic Conditions  First Defiance conducts its banking and insurance business primarily in
northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan. Unemployment rates for most of the counties within our geographic market area are above the median rate for the United States and above the median rates for the States of Ohio, Indiana, and
Michigan. As reported for December 2011, the 14 counties in which our offices are located had unemployment rates between 7.2% and 13.3%, and all experienced an improvement in their unemployment rate in 2011 compared to 2010. In addition, real estate
values in First Defiances markets have declined and may continue to decline. High unemployment and declining real estate values have a negative impact on the Companys earnings and financial condition because: 
 


 

 
 more borrowers are unable to make payments on their loans; 
 


 

 
 the value of collateral securing loans has declined; and 
 


 

 
 the overall quality of the loan portfolio has declined. 
General Economic Conditions  Dramatic declines in real estate values, along with high unemployment,
have disrupted the national credit and capital markets over the last several years. As a result, many financial institutions have had to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions, to seek government assistance or
bankruptcy protection and, in some cases; they have been forced into a sale or closed by the bank regulatory agencies. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including to
other financial institutions, because of concern about the stability of the financial markets and the strength of counterparties. It is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will exist, which of our markets, products or other
businesses will ultimately be affected, and whether managements actions will effectively mitigate these external factors. The reduced availability of credit, the lack of confidence in the financial sector, decreased consumer confidence,
increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
As a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions, First Defiance faces the following risks: 
 


 

 
 inability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, or decreases in value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans
resulting in significant credit losses, which could result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results; 
  -23-



Table of Contents


 

 
 increased regulation of the financial services industry, including heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements or expectations;
compliance with such regulation will likely increase costs and may limit the Companys ability to pursue business opportunities;   


 

 
 further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, may result
in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions;   


 

 
 increased competition among financial services companies due to the consolidation of financial institutions, which may adversely affect our ability
to market the Companys products and services; and   


 

 
 further increases in FDIC insurance premiums due to the market developments which have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and
reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.  Declining Real Estate Values 
Approximately 75.5% of the loans in First Federals portfolio are secured in whole or in part by real estate. As residential real estate prices have declined in the last three years, defaults and foreclosures have increased. Commercial real
estate values have also declined, and the owners of many income-producing properties are experiencing declines in their revenue, which may adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Foreclosures and resolutions of nonperforming loans
require significant personnel resources and involve other costs that may increase our operating expenses. Properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are taking longer to sell in the current economy, which increases the
Companys expenses for managing, maintaining and insuring real estate owned. If First Federal is unable to sell properties at a price that will cover its expenses as well as the unpaid principal and interest on the loan, the resulting
write-downs and losses will adversely affect First Defiances net income.  Volatile Capital Markets
 The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on credit availability for certain issuers. Continuing market disruption and
volatility could have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access capital and on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  First Defiances stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the underlying performance of First Defiance. General market price declines and
overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of its common stock, and the current market price of the stock may not be indicative of future market prices. 
First Defiances stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate
substantially in the future. These factors include:   


 

 
 Actions by government regulators;   


 

 
 First Defiances announcements of developments related to its business; 
 


 

 
 Fluctuation in our results of operation;   


 

 
 Sales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace; 
 


 

 
 New reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry.

First Defiances loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate
loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses.  At December 31, 2011, First Federals portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $776.0 million, or approximately 51.7% of total loans. First Federals commercial real estate loans
typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose First Defiance to greater
risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside
of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.  At December 31, 2011, First Federals portfolio of commercial loans totaled $349.1 million, or approximately 23.2% of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose First Defiance to a greater
risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. First Federals commercial loans are primarily
made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the
availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to
appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a
personal guarantee, if any exists.  First Defiance targets its business lending towards small and medium-sized
businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, First Defiances results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.  Increases to the allowance for loan losses may cause First Defiances earnings to
decrease.  First Defiance makes a number of assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan
portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, First Defiance relies on loan
quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If its assumptions prove to be incorrect, First Defiances allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting
in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance and any loan losses that exceed First Defiances reserves would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
Changes in interest rates can adversely affect First Defiances profitability 
First Defiances earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is
the difference, or spread, between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including: 
  -25-



Table of Contents


 

 
 the rate of inflation;   


 

 
 economic conditions;   


 

 
 federal monetary policies; and   


 

 
 stability of domestic and foreign markets.  Because First Defiances interest-bearing liabilities may reprice or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates could result in a decrease in First
Defiances net interest income.  First Federal originates a significant amount of residential mortgage
loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale
and consequently fee income, which First Defiance reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage
servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, First Defiance may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower
earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying.  Laws and regulations may affect First Defiances results of operations.  The earnings of financial institutions are affected by the regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply, and the
Federal Reserve which regulates the Company and OCC which regulates First Federal, and the FDIC, which regulates First Federal. The Federal Reserve has extensive supervisory authority over the Company, affecting a comprehensive range of matters
relating to ownership and control of First Defiances shares, First Defiances acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for the Company to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of
operations. These supervisory and regulatory powers are intended primarily for the protection for First Defiances depositors and customers and the deposit insurance fund, rather than First Defiances shareholders. 
In connection with its supervision of First Defiance, its former primary regulator, the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS), which was eliminated and replaced by the Federal Reserve, and the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which is a tool employed by bank regulatory agencies to address areas of concern
to the regulator. The memorandum for the Company requires that it submit to the Federal Reserve specific strategies for increasing and maintaining capital at targets, to be established by First Defiances board of directors that are
commensurate with First Defiances risk profile. At December 31, 2011, The Company and First Federals capital ratios exceed all the regulatory thresholds to be considered well-capitalized. The memorandum also requires
that First Defiance obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before it pays any dividends, including dividends on common shares, or incur, issue, renew, or rollover any debt. First Federal also agreed to a memorandum of understanding with the OTS,
which was eliminated and replaced by the OCC, the principal terms of which relate to First Federals risk profile and asset quality. Compliance with the First Federal memorandum may restrict First Defiances operations and adversely affect
its financial results.

First Defiance issued $37.0 million of our Series A Preferred Shares to the
U.S. Treasury pursuant to the CPP. The rules and policies applicable to CPP participants continue to evolve and their scope, timing and effect cannot be predicted. Current restrictions include limits on First Defiances ability to pay retention
awards, bonuses and other incentive compensation during the period in which it has any outstanding securities held by the U.S. Treasury that were issued under the CPP. These limitations may adversely affect First Defiances ability to recruit
and retain key personnel, especially if it is competing for talent against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions.  The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. As a result of ongoing challenges facing the U.S. economy in particular, the potential exists for new laws and
regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase First Defiances cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent
that they limit the manner in which First Defiance may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest
spreads.  First Defiances ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income.
 First Defiances principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as
FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. Also, First Defiance maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary
source of liquidity. First Defiances access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect First Defiance directly or the financial
services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. 
Other possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional
collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank. First Defiance does
not currently have any borrowings from a commercial bank, but it has used them in the past. Pursuant to the MOU, First Defiance must obtain Federal Reserve approval before incurring or issuing any debt. 
Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our
expenses, pay dividends to First Defiances shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying First Defiances borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity,
business, results of operations and financial condition.  Competition affects First Defiances earnings. 
First Defiances continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate
loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The type of
institutions First Defiance competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a
result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of First Defiances competitors can offer a 
  -27-



Table of Contents

broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. To stay competitive in its market area, First Defiance may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of
its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin.  The increasing complexity of First
Defiances operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition 
First Defiance processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks
related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction
processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. First Defiance could also experience additional loss as a result of potential
legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.  First Defiance has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational
standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. Losses from
operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors.  First
Defiances operations are also dependent on its existing infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure as a result of fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failures, computer
hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic response to such activity, or other events outside of the control of management could have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
First Defiance has a business recovery plan, but there are no assurances that such a plan will work as intended or that it will prevent significant interruptions to operations. 
Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of the Companys
computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business.  In the normal course of business, First Defiance
collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of First Defiance and other third parties. Despite the security measures the Company has in place, First Defiances facilities and systems, and
those of the Companys third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, act of vandalism, computer viruses, lost or misplace data, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the unauthorized disclosure or loss
of confidential customer information, whether by First Defiance or by the Companys third party vendors, could severely damage First Defiances reputation, expose the Company to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt First
Defiances operations and have a material adverse effect on First Defiances business.

The issuance of Series A Preferred Shares and Warrants to the U. S. Government may
adversely affect the holders of First Defiances Common Shares.  First Defiance issued 37,000 Series
A Preferred Shares and warrants to purchase 550,595 shares of First Defiance common stock (the Common Shares) to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The dividends accrued and the accretion on discount
on the Series A Preferred Shares issued to the U.S. Treasury reduce the net income available to the holders of our Common Shares and our earnings per Common Share. Because the Series A Preferred Shares are cumulative, any dividends not declared or
paid will accumulate and will be payable when the payment of dividends is resumed. If the Series A Preferred Shares are not redeemed within five years after their original date of issuance, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Shares
will increase from 5.0% per annum to 9.0% per annum. If First Defiance is unable to redeem the Series A Preferred Shares by December 5, 2013, the increase in the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Shares could have a
material adverse effect on the Companys earnings and could also adversely affect its ability to declare and pay dividends on its Common Shares. Series A Preferred Shares will also receive preferential treatment in the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of First Defiance.  The Common Shares underlying the Warrant represent approximately
5.4% of the Common Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in our total outstanding Common Shares). If the Warrant is exercised, the interest of the existing holders of Common
Shares will be diluted. Although the Treasury Department has agreed not to vote any of the Common Shares acquired upon exercise of the Warrant, a transferee of the Warrant or of any Common Shares acquired upon exercise of the Warrant is not bound by
this restriction. Finally, the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares allow the U.S. Treasury to impose additional restrictions, including those on dividends and to unilaterally amend the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares to comply with changes
in applicable federal law.  If First Defiance fails to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for six
quarterly dividend periods (whether or not consecutive), the Treasury Department will have the right to appoint two directors to the Companys Board of Directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid. As long as the Series A
Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or our Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the Articles), the vote or consent of holders owning at least 66 2/3% of the Series
A Preferred Shares outstanding is required for:  


 

 
 any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the Series A shares; 
 


 

 
 any amendments to the rights of the Series A Preferred Shares that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of the
Series A shares; or   


 

 
 the consummation of any merger, share exchange or similar transaction unless the Series A shares remain outstanding, or if we are not the surviving
entity in such transaction, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity and the Series A shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities have the rights, preferences, privileges and voting power of
the Series A shares.  The holders of Series A Preferred Shares, including the U.S. Treasury,
may have different interests from the holders of the Common Shares, and could vote to block transactions that may be in the best interest of the present holders of the Common Shares. 
  -29-



Table of Contents
First Defiance may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may result in
significant dilution to holders of the Common Shares.  There can be no assurance that First Defiance will
not in the future determine that it is advisable, or that it will not encounter circumstances where the Company determines that it is necessary, to issue additional Common Shares, securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares or
common-equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital. In addition, if the Company decides to repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, it may elect or be
required by its regulators to increase the amount of our Tier 1 common equity through the sale of additional Common Shares. Further, there can be no assurance that the regulators will not require the Company to generate additional capital, including
Tier 1 common equity, in the future in the event of further negative economic circumstances, in order for First Defiance to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury under the CPP or otherwise. The market price of the Common
Shares could decline as a result of such exchange offerings, as well as other sales of a large block of the Common Shares or similar securities in the market thereafter, or the perception that such sales could occur. These factors could have a
material adverse effect on the Company.  The Company may not be permitted to repurchase the U.S. Treasurys CPP
investment if and when it requests approval to do so.  While it is the Companys plan to repurchase
the Series A Preferred Stock as soon as practicable, in order to repurchase such securities, in whole or in part, it must establish to its regulators satisfaction that all of the conditions to repurchase have been met and must obtain the
approval of its primary federal regulator and the U.S. Treasury. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to repurchase the U.S. Treasurys CPP investment in the Series A Preferred Stock subject to conditions that the Company
finds acceptable, or at all. In addition to limiting First Defiances ability to return capital to its shareholders, the U.S. Treasurys investment could limit the Companys ability to retain key executives and other key employees
because of the limits on compensation that may be paid to employees of CPP participants, and limit the Companys ability to develop business opportunities.  If the Company is unable to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock within five years from the issuance date, the cost of this capital will increase substantially. 
If the Company is unable to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to December 5, 2013, the cost of this capital
will increase substantially on that date, from 5.0% per annum (approximately $1.9 million annually) to 9.0% per annum (approximately $3.3 million annually). Depending on our financial condition at the time, this increase in the annual
dividend rate could have a material negative effect on the Companys liquidity.  Regulatory restriction
on dividends and First Defiances ability to repurchase shares may adversely affect its shareholders and the market price of the Common Shares. 
As long as the Series A shares are outstanding and held by the Treasury Department, the Company cannot increase the
quarterly dividend on the Common Shares above $.26 per share without prior approval from the Treasury Department. In addition to this restriction, the Federal Reserve has directed First Defiance to seek approval of the Federal Reserve before paying
any dividends on the Common Shares.  The Companys principal source of funds to pay dividends on the
Common Shares is distributions from First Federal, which require the prior approval of the OCC. The OCC has advised 
  -30-



Table of Contents

First Defiance that it is not likely to approve any distributions from First Federal for this purpose in the foreseeable future. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have also advised the Company that
it should not pay dividends utilizing borrowings or other sources of funds that it may have access to.  As
long as the Series A shares are outstanding and held by the Treasury Department, the Company cannot repurchase Common Shares without the consent of the Treasury Department (other than repurchases in connection with the administration of any employee
benefit plan in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice and certain other exemptions). Further, the Federal Reserve has directed First Defiance to seek approval of the Federal Reserve before repurchasing any Common Shares.

 First Defiances ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent
on the ability of the Subsidiaries to pay dividends to First Defiance. The OCC advised the Company that prior approval would be required to pay dividends utilizing borrowings or other sources of funds to which the Company may have access to. Capital
distributions include, without limitation, payments of cash dividends, repurchases and certain other acquisitions by an association of its shares and payments to stockholders of another association in an acquisition of such other association.
 Even if the OCC approves a distribution from First Federal to First Defiance, as a result of participating in
the CPP, First Defiance is prohibited, without prior approval of the U.S. Treasury, from paying a quarterly cash dividend of more than $0.26 per share as long as the Series A shares are outstanding and held by the Treasury Department. 
First Federal paid $4.8 million in dividends to First Defiance during 2010. First Insurance paid $1.0 million in
dividends to First Defiance during 2010. There were no dividends paid by First Federal or First Insurance in 2011.  The line graph below compares the yearly percentage change in cumulative total shareholder return on First Defiance common stock and the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index, the SNL
NASDAQ Bank Index and the SNL Midwest Thrift Index. An investment of $100 on December 31, 2006, and the reinvestment of all dividends are assumed. The performance graph represents past performance and should not be considered to be an
indication of future performance.

needs. First Federals Customer First philosophy and culture complements this need of its clients. First Federal believes this personal service model differentiates First Federal from its competitors, particularly the larger regional
institutions. First Federal offers a wide variety of products to support commercial clients including remote deposit capture and other cash management services. First Federal also believes that the small business customer is a strong market for
First Federal. First Federal participates in many of the Small Business Administration lending programs. Maintaining a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on monitoring industry concentrations and reacting to changes in the credit characteristics
of industries is an ongoing focus.  Consumer Banking  First Federal offers customers a full range
of deposit and investment products including demand, NOW, money market, certificates of deposits, CDARS and savings accounts. First Federal offers a full range of investment products through the wealth management department and a wide variety of
consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, installment loans and education loans. First Federal also offers online banking services, which include online bill pay along with debit cards. 
Fee Income Development  Generation of fee income and the diversification of revenue sources are accomplished
through the mortgage banking operation, insurance subsidiary and the wealth management department as First Defiance seeks to reduce reliance on retail transaction fee income. 
Deposit Growth  First Federals focus has been to grow core deposits with an emphasis on total
relationship banking with both our retail and commercial customers. First Federal has initiated a pricing strategy that considers the whole relationship of the customer. First Federal will continue to focus on increasing its market share in the
communities it serves by providing quality products with extraordinary customer service, business development strategies and branch expansion. First Federal will look to grow its footprint in areas believed to further compliment its overall market
share and compliment its strategy of being a high performing community bank.  Asset Quality 
Maintaining a strong credit culture is of the utmost importance to First Federal. First Federal has maintained a strong credit approval and review process that has allowed the Company to maintain a credit quality standard that balances the return
with the risks of industry concentrations and loan types. First Federal is primarily a collateral lender with an emphasis on cash flow performance, while obtaining additional support from personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment. First
Federal has directed its attention on loan types and markets that it knows well and in which its has historically been successful in. First Federal strives to have loan relationships that are well diversified in both size and industry, and monitor
the overall trends in the portfolio to maintain its industry and loan type concentration targets. First Federal maintains a problem loan remediation process that focuses on detection and resolution. First Federal maintains a strong process of
internal control that subjects the loan portfolio to periodic internal reviews as well as independent third party loan review.  Expansion Opportunities  First Defiance believes it is well positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities in its market areas, including FDIC-assisted
transactions.

First Defiance believes it has a track record of successfully accomplishing both acquisitions and de novo branching in its market area. This track record puts the Company in a solid position to
enter or expand its business. First Defiance has successfully integrated acquired institutions in the past with the most recent acquisition completed in 2008. First Defiance will continue to be disciplined as well as opportunistic in its approach to
future acquisitions and de novo branching with a focus on its primary geographic market area, which it knows well and has been competing in for a long period of time. First Defiance completed its acquisition of PDI, on July 1, 2011, which was
merged into First Insurance with offices located in Maumee and Oregon, Ohio.  Common Stock Offering 
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company completed an underwritten public common stock offering by issuing 1,600,800
shares of the Companys common stock, including 208,800 shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, at a price of $13.25 per share for gross proceeds of $21.2 million. The net proceeds to the Company
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $19.9 million.  Financial Condition 
Assets at December 31, 2011 totaled $2.07 billion compared to $2.04 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of
$32.7 million or 1.6%. Cash and equivalents increased $5.8 million to $174.9 million at December 31, 2011 from $169.2 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in assets was a result of the Companys continued strategy to increase
security purchases selectively deploying lower yielding overnight deposits into securities on the short to intermediate end of the yield curve until loan demand becomes consistent.  Securities  The securities portfolio increased $67.5
million to $233.6 million at December 31, 2011. The 2011 activity in the portfolio included $120.5 million of purchases, $25.8 million of amortization and maturities, $27.0 million of principal pay-downs and $8.5 million of securities being
sold. There was a net increase of $7.2 million in market value on available-for-sale securities. The Company also recorded $2,000 of other-than-temporary impairment on one collateralized debt obligation in 2011. See Note 6  Investment
Securities in the Notes to the financial statements for additional information.  Loans 
Gross loans receivable declined $32.4 million to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2011. For more details on the loan
balances, see Note 8  Loans Receivable in the Notes to the Financial Statements.  The majority of First
Defiances non-residential real estate and commercial loans are to small and mid-sized businesses. The combined commercial, non-residential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios totaled $1.13 billion and $1.14 billion at
December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively and accounted for approximately 75.0% and 74.3% of First Defiances loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods. First Defiance believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in
its market area in the commercial and commercial real estate lending area by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients. 
The one-to-four family residential portfolio totaled $203.4 million at December 31, 2011, compared with $205.9
million at the end of 2010. At the end of 2011, those loans comprised 13.6% of the total loan portfolio, down from 13.5% at December 31, 2010.  Construction loans, which include one to four family and commercial real estate properties, increased to $31.6 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2010. These
loans accounted for approximately 2.1% and 2.0% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Home equity and home improvement loans declined to $122.1 million at
December 31, 2011, from $133.6 million at the end of 2010. At the end of 2011, those loans comprised 8.1% of the total loan portfolio, down from 8.7% at December 31, 2010. 
Consumer finance and mobile home loans were just $18.9 million at December 31, 2011, down from $22.8 million at the
end of 2010. These loans comprised just 1.3% and 1.5% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  In order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The
Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans, and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the
Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. First Defiances loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account
officer in any way in making their determination of value.  First Federal generally does not require updated
appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower.  When a collateral
dependent loan is downgraded to classified status, First Federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if necessary, based on First Federals assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc, First Federal will discount this
amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by First Federals estimation of the carrying and selling costs. In some instances, we may require a new appraisal.
Finally, First Federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, considering guarantor support and determines if a reserve is necessary.  When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, First Federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and adjusts the reserve as necessary based upon the new appraisal and an estimate
of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined
based on appraised value less First Federals estimate of the liquidation costs.  First Federal does not
adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon First Federals experience with
liquidating similar properties.  All loans over 90 days past due and/or on non-accrual as well as all Troubled
Debt Restructured loans are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90 day delinquency occurs. For Troubled Debt Restructured loans, the loans are put into non-performing status in the
month in which the restructure occurs.  As stated above, once a collateral dependent loan is identified as
non-performing, First Federal generally gets an appraisal. Troubled Debt Restructure collateral dependent loans receive an appraisal as part of the restructure credit decision. 
Appraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The First Federal Loan Loss Reserve
Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary adjustment to the reserve at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter. 
  -41-



Table of Contents
Any partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered
non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before First Federal will consider an upgrade to
performing status. If the loan maintains a rate at restructuring that is lower than the market rate for similar credits, the loan will remain classified as Troubled Debt Restructuring until such time as it is paid off or restructured at prevailing
rates and terms. First Federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after six months of satisfactory payment performance.  For loans where First Federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary, other means are used to verify the value of the real estate, such as recent sales of similar properties on which First
Federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers, brokers, realtors and investors. First Federal monitors and tracks its reserves quarterly to determine accuracy. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used. The most recent
analysis indicates that our actual charge-offs are on average within 10% of the specific reserves previously established for these loans.  Loan modifications constitute a Troubled Debt Restructuring if First Federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it
would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered Troubled Debt Restructurings, First Federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loans effective interest rate or, as a practical
expedient, it may measure impairment based on the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral even though Troubled Debt Restructurings are not expected to be deemed collateral dependent. The difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the loan is recorded as a valuation allowance.  Allowance for Loan Losses 
The allowance for loan losses represents managements assessment of the estimated probable credit losses in the loan
portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such
changes on collateral values and borrowers ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to
significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on managements evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an
outside party to conduct an independent loan review of all commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships that exceed $750,000 of aggregate exposure over a twelve month period. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan
review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans. 
The provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses
after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which, in managements best estimate, is necessary to absorb probable credit losses within the existing loan portfolio in the normal course of business. The allowance
for loan loss is made up of two basic components. The first component is the specific allowance in which the company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits. The second component is the general reserve. The general reserve is
used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolios based on quantitative and qualitative factors. Due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio, the
Companys judgment on the amount of the allowance necessary to absorb loans losses is approximate  In
establishing specific reserves, First Federal analyzes all loans on its classified and special mention lists at least quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the
financial strength of any guarantor in determining the amount of impairment of individual loans and the specific reserve to be recorded. 
  -42-



Table of Contents
For purpose of the general reserve analysis, the loan portfolio is
stratified into nine different loan pools based on loan type and by market area to allocate historic loss experience. The loss experience factor applied to the non-impaired loan portfolio was based upon historical losses of the most recent weighted
rolling eight quarters ending December 31, 2011.  The stratification of the loan portfolio resulted in a
quantitative general allowance of $19.5 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $18.3 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in the quantitative allowance was due to the increase in the historical loss factors relating to commercial,
commercial real estate, residential and credit card loans.  In addition to the quantitative analysis, a
qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non-impaired loan portfolio for various factors that have a bearing on its loss content, including but not limited to the following: 
 


 

 
 Changes in international, national and local economic and business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments
  


 

 
 Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 
 


 

 
 Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans; and changes in trends in the volume of non-accrual loans,
troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications   


 

 
 The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
 


 

 
 Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
 


 

 
 Changes in the political and regulatory environment 
 


 

 
 Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices
  


 

 
 Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff 
 


 

 
 Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process 
The qualitative analysis at December 31, 2011 indicated a general reserve of $6.5 million compared with $6.2 million
at December 31, 2010. All 14 counties that represent the footprint of the Company have seen improvements in their unemployment rates in 2011, with six falling below the national average of 8.3%. The unemployment rates in December 2011 range
from a low of 7.4% to a high of 13.3% compared to the unemployment rates in 2010 ranging from a low of 8.1% to a high of 16.3%. First Defiances general reserve percentages for main loan segments not otherwise classified ranged from 0.20% for
construction loans to 2.04% for nonresidential real estate loans.  As a result of the quantitative and
qualitative analyses, along with the change in specific reserves, the Companys provision for loan losses for 2011 was $12.4 million compared to $23.2 million for 2010. The allowance for loan losses was $33.3 million at December 31, 2011
and $41.1 million at December 31, 2010 and represented 2.24% and 2.70% of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, respectively. That decrease was mainly the result of higher charge off activity and improvement in
overall credit risk profile. The pace of the decline in real estate values has slowed and in some markets has stabilized. While some collateral dependent loans no longer have enough collateral value to support the outstanding balance Management
believes it has processes in place to identify and assess market values. Management has expanded its credit monitoring functions even further beyond its traditionally strong focus. Additional asset review functions and more delinquent loan reporting
requirements have been added to assist in this monitoring. Management will continually review credit concentrations by industry and has placed lower limits on lending within certain types of loan

categories. Management has also segmented the commercial real estate portfolio to track the general performance of these segments to further refine the predictive process of identifying potential
problem loans. The provision was offset by charge offs of $15.5 million against specific reserves and $5.9 million against general reserves and recoveries of $1.2 million resulting in a decrease to the overall allowance for loan loss of $7.8
million. In managements opinion, the overall allowance for loan losses of $33.3 million as of December 31, 2011 is adequate.  Management also assesses the value of real estate owned as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate.
In 2011, First Defiance recorded OREO write-downs that totaled $1.0 million. These amounts were included in other non-interest expense. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2011 for real estate owned and repossessed
assets represent the realizable value of such assets.  Total classified loans decreased to $122.5 million at
December 31, 2011, compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, a total of $18.9 million of loans were classified as substandard for which a specific reserve is required. A total of $103.6 million in
additional credits were classified as substandard at December 31, 2011 for which no specific reserve is required because of factors such as the level of collateral or the strength of guarantors. First Defiance also classified $10,000 of loans
doubtful at December 31, 2011. By contrast, at December 31, 2010, a total of $47.5 million of loans were classified as substandard for which some level of specific reserve was required and $83.2 million were classified as substandard which
did not require any reserve. At December 31, 2010, $2.4 million of loans were classified as doubtful. 
First Defiances ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 77.9% at December 31, 2011
compared with 87.3% at December 31, 2010. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at December 31, 2011 are appropriate.
 At December 31, 2011, First Defiance had total non-performing assets of $46.3 million, compared to $56.6
million at December 31, 2010. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 days past due, troubled debt restructured loans and real estate owned and other assets held for sale. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 by
category were as follows:

 The decrease in non-performing loans between December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2011 is primarily in single family residential as well as in the commercial loans. The balance of single family residential loans and commercial loans was $3.3 million and $4.7 million higher at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31,
2011, respectively. Approximately $20.0 million of 2010 non-performing loans are still considered non-performing loans at December 31, 2011 and $2.8 million of real estate owned at December 31, 2011 was in real estate owned at
December 31, 2010. The commercial and non-residential real estate and multi-family real estate loans that are non-performing at December 31, 2011 are comprised of 82 relationships, with 9 relationships making up $20.8 million of the $35.0
million total. The allowance for loan losses includes $2.9 million for those 9 relationships. By comparison, at December 31, 2010, 8 relationships made up the $22.2 million of commercial and non-residential real estate and multi-family real
estate loans total of $33.3 million.  Non-performing loans in the single-family residential, non-residential
and multi-family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent 1.91%, 3.63% and 1.97% of the total loans in those categories respectively at December 31, 2011 compared to 3.48%, 2.83% and 3.12% respectively for the same
categories at December 31, 2010. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in 2011 is consistent with both charge-off experience and the risk inherent in the
overall credits in the portfolio.  Non-performing assets, which include non-accrual loans, accruing troubled
debt restructured loans and real estate owned, decreased to $46.3 million at December 31, 2011 from $56.6 million at December 31, 2010.  First Federals Asset Review Committee meets monthly to review the status of work-out strategies for all criticized relationships, which include all non-accrual loans. Based on such factors as
anticipated collateral values in liquidation scenarios, cash flow projections, assessment of net worth of guarantors and all other factors which may mitigate risk of loss, the Asset Review Committee makes recommendations regarding required
allowances and proposed charge-offs which are approved by the Senior Loan Committee (in the case of charge-offs) or the Loan Loss Reserve Committee (in the case of specific allowances).

Loans Acquired with Impairment 
Certain loans acquired in the ComBanc, Genoa, and Pavilion acquisitions had evidence that the credit quality of the loan
had deteriorated since its origination and in managements assessment at the acquisition date it was probable that First Defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic
30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, these loans were recorded based on managements estimate of the fair value of the loans. At the acquisition date of January 21, 2005, loans with a contractual
receivable of $3.4 million were acquired from ComBanc and were deemed impaired. Those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of $2.0 million. On April 8, 2005, loans with a contractual receivable of $1.5 million were acquired from Genoa
and were deemed impaired. Those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of $721,000. On March 14, 2008, loans with a contractual receivable of $6.4 million were acquired from Pavilion and were deemed impaired. Those loans were recorded at
a net realizable value of $4.4 million.  As of December 31, 2011, the total contractual receivable for
those loans was $2.2 million and the recorded value was $1.2 million.  High Loan-to-Value Mortgage Loans 
The majority of First Defiances mortgage loans are collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate,
have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. First Federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan-to-value is greater than 80% to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI).
Management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its PMI providers.  First Federal
originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 80% where PMI is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths. The loan-to-value ratios on these loans are generally
limited to 85% and exceptions must be approved by First Federals senior loan committee. Management monitors the balance of one-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan
to value standards (90% for owner occupied residences, 85% for non-owner occupied residences and one-to-four family construction loans, 75% for developed land and 65% for raw land). During 2011, management purchased two groups of single family loans
to medical professionals that had LTVs greater than 90%. These loans were primarily variable rate loans originated in Ohio in 2011. These purchases led to the growth in the high loan to value mortgage pool. Total loans that exceed those
standards described above at December 31, 2011 totaled $51.7 million, compared to $25.9 million at December 31, 2010. These loans are generally paying as agreed. 
First Defiance does not make interest-only first-mortgage residential loans, nor does it have residential mortgage loan
products or other consumer products that allow negative amortization.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill at December 31, 2011 was $61.5 million compared to $57.6 million at December 31, 2010. The change in
goodwill is due to the acquisition of PDI in July 2011 resulting in an addition to goodwill of $4.0 million. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2011 or 2010. Core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets remained relatively flat at
$6.2 million in 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, changes to the core deposit intangibles and other intangibles included the recognition of $1.4 million of amortization expense which was offset by the addition of $947,000 to the customer
relationship intangible asset and $518,000 to the non-compete intangible asset as a result of the July 2011 acquisition mentioned above.

Deposits  Total deposits at December 31, 2011 were $1.596 billion compared to $1.575 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $20.8 million or 1.3%. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $29.2
million or 13.5% while interest bearing deposits decreased $8.4 million or 0.6%. Non-interest bearing checking accounts grew by $29.2 million, money market and interest bearing checking accounts grew by $53.6 million, savings grew by $10.6 million
while retail certificates of deposit declined by $41.5 million. Management periodically utilizes the national market for certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs. The balance of national CDs decreased to $10.6 million at
December 31, 2011, from $41.8 million at December 31, 2010. For more details on the deposit balances in general see Note 12  Deposits.  Borrowings  FHLB advances totaled $81.8 million at
December 31, 2011 compared to $116.9 million at December 31, 2010. The balance at the end of 2011 includes $44.0 million of convertible advances with rates ranging from 2.35% to 5.44%. These advances are all callable by the FHLB, at which
point they would convert to a three-month LIBOR advance if not paid off. Those advances have final maturity dates ranging from 2013 to 2018. In addition, First Defiance has advances totaling $17.0 million that are callable by the FHLB only if the
three-month LIBOR rate exceeds a strike rate ranging from 7.5% to 8.0%. The rate on those advances ranges from 3.48% to 3.85%. Lastly, First Defiance has $20.8 million of fixed-rate advances with rates ranging from 2.60% to 4.10%. The change in FHLB
advances is the result of paying off a $10.0 million putable advance and a $10.0 million strike-rate advance in the first quarter of 2011 at maturity and a $15.0 million single maturity fixed rate advance at maturity in the third quarter of 2011.
 Fat December 31, 2011, First Defiance also had $60.4 million of securities that were sold with
agreements to repurchase, compared to $56.2 million of repurchase funding at December 31, 2010.  Capital Resources 
Total shareholders equity increased $37.8 million to $278.1 million at December 31, 2011. This increase is
primarily the result of the Companys underwritten public common stock offering in the first quarter of 2011 that increased equity a net $19.9 million, net income of $15.5 million and a $4.7 million unrealized gain on available-for-sale
securities. These increases were slightly offset by $1.9 million of preferred stock dividends at December 31, 2011. In 2003, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 640,000 shares, 93,124 of which remain available for
repurchase. During 2011, no shares were repurchased but a total of 850 stock options were exercised by four employees, resulting in a $11,000 increase in shareholders equity. During 2010, no shares were repurchased but a total of 250 stock options
were exercised by three employees, resulting in a $3,000 increase in shareholders equity. Participation in the CPP prohibits the Company from buying back any of its common shares during the period it has CPP funds outstanding.

Results of Operations  Summary  First Defiance reported net income of $15.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $8.1 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net income applicable to common shares was $13.5 million in 2011 compared with $6.1
million in 2010 and $5.2 million in 2009. On a diluted per common share basis, First Defiance earned $1.42 in 2011, $0.75 in 2010 and $0.63 in 2009.  First Defiances 2011 net income of $15.5 million included $234,000 of acquisition related costs resulting from the PDI acquisition in July 2011. The 2011 net income included $234,000 of acquisition
related costs resulting from the PDI acquisition. The 2010 net income included $63,000 of acquisition related costs resulting from the Andres ONeil & Lowe Insurance Agency (AOL) acquisition. The 2009 net income did not
include any acquisition related costs. Excluding these items, core earnings were $15.7 million, $8.1 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. On a diluted per share basis, core earnings
amounted to $1.43, $0.75 and $0.63 for those same three periods. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures assists when comparing results period-to-period in a meaningful and consistent manner and provides a better
measure of results for First Defiances ongoing operations. A reconciliation of GAAP earnings to core earnings is as follows:

 Net Interest Income  First Defiances net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread (i.e. the difference between the yields on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing
liabilities) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  As demand
for new lending opportunities remained soft in 2011, the Company invested some of its liquidity into investment securities. This may continue into 2012 as management deems it appropriate within its liquidity strategy and consideration of overall
loan demand.  Net interest income was $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to
$70.2 million and $67.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 respectively. The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.88%, 3.89% and 3.76% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. The margin
was relatively flat between 2010 and 2011. Interest-earning asset yields decreased 49 basis points (to 4.80% in 2011 from 5.29% in 2010) and the cost of interest bearing liabilities between the two periods decreased 49 basis points (to 1.12% in 2011
from 1.61% in 2010). 
  -50-



Table of Contents
The increase in margin between 2009 and 2010 is due to a widening of the
interest rate spread, which increased to 3.68% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 3.50% for 2009. The increase in spread between 2009 and 2010 occurred due to interest-earning asset yields decreasing by 29 basis points (to 5.29%
in 2010 from 5.58% in 2009) which was more than offset by the cost of interest bearing liabilities between the two periods decreasing by 47 basis points (to 1.61% in 2010 from 2.08% in 2009). 
Total interest income decreased by $8.8 million or 9.2% to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from
$95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest income was due to a decline in asset yields, mainly as a result of a drop in yields on loans receivable which declined 28 basis points to 5.49% at December 31,
2011. Interest income from loans decreased to $78.6 million for 2011 compared to $88.6 million in 2010 which represents a decline of 11.3%.  During the same period the average balance of investment securities increased to $205.6 million for 2011 from $154.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest income from the investment
portfolio increased $1.0 million from 2010 to 2011. The tax-equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 4.19% in 2011 compared to 4.71% in 2010. The investment portfolio yield decreased coupled by a narrowing of the overall duration of
investments to 3.7 years at December 31, 2011 from 3.9 years at December 31, 2010.  Interest expense
decreased by $8.5 million in 2011 compared to 2010, to $17.2 million from $25.7 million. This decrease was due to a 49 basis point decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2011. Interest expense related to interest-bearing
deposits was $12.2 million in 2011 and $19.2 million in 2010. Expenses on FHLB advances and other interest bearing funding sources were $3.2 million and $530,000 respectively in 2011 and $4.7 million and $455,000 respectively in 2010. Interest
expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $1.3 million in 2011 and 2010.  Total
interest income decreased by $4.7 million or 4.7% to $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest income was due to a decline in asset yields, mainly
as a result of a drop in yields on loans receivable which declined 9 basis points to 5.77% at December 31, 2010. Interest income from loans decreased to $88.6 million for 2010 compared to $93.7 million in 2009 which represents a decline of
5.4%.  During the same period the average balance of investment securities increased to $154.6 million for
2010 from $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest income from the investment portfolio increased $282,000 from 2009 to 2010. The tax-equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 4.71% in 2010 compared to 5.23% in 2009.
The investment portfolio yield decreased coupled by a narrowing of the overall duration of investments to 3.9 years at December 31, 2010 from 4.3 years at December 31, 2009. 
Interest expense decreased by $7.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009, to $25.7 million from $33.3 million. This decrease
was due to a 47 basis point decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2010 which more than offset the $1.6 million increase in the average balance of those liabilities in 2010. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits
increased by $18.5 million at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $19.2 million in 2010 and $26.1 million in 2009. Expenses on FHLB advances and other interest bearing
funding sources were $4.7 million and $455,000 respectively in 2010 and $5.1 million and $570,000 respectively in 2009. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $1.3 million in 2010 compared to $1.5 million
in 2009.

 Interest on certain tax exempt loans (amounting to $231,000, $274,000 and $275,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively) and tax-exempt securities
($2.5 million, $2.0 million and $1.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009) is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes. The average balance of such loans was $5.5 million, $6.1 million and $6.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 while the average balance
of such securities was $60.5 million, $47.0 million and $41.9 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. In order to compare the tax-exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields, the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre-tax
equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 35%.   


(2)
 At December 31, 2011, the yields earned and rates paid were as follows: loans receivable, 5.14%; securities, 3.60%; FHLB stock, 3.90%; total
interest-earning assets, 4.80%; deposits, 0.47%; FHLB advances, 3.68%; other borrowings, 0.90%, subordinated debentures, 3.75%; total interest-bearing liabilities, 0.70%; and interest rate spread, 4.10%. 
 


(3)
 Interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
  


(4)
 Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

Table of Contents
The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates
and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected First Defiances tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) change in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume), and (iii) total change in
rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.  Table 7  Changes in Interest Rates and Volumes

 Provision for Loan Losses  First Defiances provision for
loan losses was $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $23.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  Provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio.
Factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios, historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by First Defiance, the amount of non-performing assets (including loans which meet the FASB ASC Topic 310
definition of impaired), the amount of assets graded by management as substandard, doubtful, or loss, general economic conditions (particularly as they relate to First Defiances market areas); and other factors related to the collectability of
First Defiances loan portfolio. See also Allowance for Loan Losses in Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 8 to the audited financial statements. 
Noninterest Income  Noninterest income decreased by $74,000 or 0.3% in 2011 to $27.5 million
from $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. That followed an increase of $1.3 million or 4.9% in 2010 from $26.3 million in 2009.  Service fees and other charges decreased to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $12.7 million for 2010 and $13.5 million for 2009. The decline in income in 2011 and 2010 mainly
related to a new rule issued by the Federal Reserve Board that became effective in the third quarter of 2010 as well as changes in customer patterns. This rule prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on
automated teller machines and one-time debit card transactions, 
  -53-



Table of Contents

unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Consumers must be provided a notice that explains the financial institutions overdraft
services, including the fees associated with the service, and the consumers choices.  First
Federals overdraft privilege program generally provides for the automatic payment of modest overdraft limits on all accounts deemed to be in good standing when the account is accessed using paper-based check processing, a teller withdrawal, a
point-of-sale terminal, an ACH transaction, an online banking or voice-response transfer, or an ATM. To be in good standing, an account must be brought to a positive balance within a 30-day period and have not excessively used the overdraft
privilege program. Overdraft limits are established for all customers without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification. The approach includes a systematic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made
to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal, expected and reoccurring deposits. The risk assessment by portfolio approach assumes a minimal degree of
undetermined credit risk associated with unidentified individual accounts that are overdrawn for 30 or more days. Consumer accounts overdrawn for more than 60 days are automatically charged off. Fees are charged as a one-time fee per occurrence, up
to five charges per day, and the fee charged for an item that is paid is equal to the fee charged for a non-sufficient fund item that is returned.  Overdrawn balances, net of allowance for losses, are reflected as loans on First Defiances balance sheet. The fees charged for this service are established based both on the return of processing
costs plus a profit, and on the level of fees charged by competitors in the Companys market area for similar services. These fees are considered to be compensation for providing a service to the customer and therefore deemed to be noninterest
income rather than interest income. Fee income recorded for the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010 related to the overdraft privilege product, net of adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts, were $5.4 million and $7.3
million, respectively. Accounts charged off are included in noninterest expense. The allowance for uncollectible overdrafts was $67,000 at December 31, 2011 and $83,000 at December 31, 2010. 
Noninterest income also includes gains, losses and impairment on investment securities. In 2011, First Defiance realized
a $216,000 net gain on securities compared to a $339,000 net loss in 2010 and a $3.7 million net loss in 2009. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, First Defiance recognized other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges for certain impaired
investment securities, where in managements opinion, the value of the investment will not be recovered. The total OTTI charges in 2011 were $2,000 and gains on sale or call of securities were $218,000. Management recorded $2,000 of OTTI on its
investment of one trust preferred collateralized debt obligation (CDOs) as a result of managements analysis of the securities. The Company held nine CDOs at December 31, 2011. Four of those CDOs were written down in full prior
to January 1, 2010. The remaining five CDOs have a total amortized cost of $3.8 million at December 31, 2011. Of these five, three, with a total amortized cost of $1.8 million, were identified as OTTI in prior periods. The final two CDOs,
with a total amortized cost of $2.0 million, continue to pay principal and interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the securities and no credit loss impairment has been identified in managements analysis. Therefore, these
two CDO investments have not been deemed by management to be OTTI. In 2010, there were 30 securities called or matured and four securities sold, resulting in a net loss of $8,000. The total OTTI charges in 2010 were $331,000 and losses on sale or
call of securities were $8,000. Management recorded $214,000 of OTTI on its investments of three trust preferred collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and a $117,000 write-down of its perpetual preferred securities issued by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac as a result of managements analysis of the securities. The total OTTI charges in 2009 were $3.9 million and gains on sale or call of securities were $284,000. Management recorded $3.9 million of OTTI on its investment of nine
CDOs as a result of managements analysis of the securities. In 2009, there were 21 securities called or matured and 13 securities sold, resulting in a net gain of $284,000. 
Mortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans, fees for servicing mortgage loans for others an
offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights, and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income totaled $6.4 million, 
  -54-



Table of Contents

$7.8 million and $9.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $1.4 million decrease in 2011 from 2010 is attributable to a $1.4 million decrease in the gain on sale of loans and a
$757,000 negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights which were partially offset by an increase of $284,000 in servicing revenue and a decrease of $473,000 in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights expense. The
negative change of $757,000 in servicing rights valuation adjustments was due to an impairment charge of $404,000 in 2011 compared with a recapture of $353,000 in 2010. The impairment charge is a reflection of the decline in the fair value of
certain sectors of the Companys portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. First Defiance originated $262.8 million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2011 compared with $388.1 million in 2010. The $1.9 million
decrease mortgage banking income in 2010 from 2009 is attributable to a $1.7 million decrease in the gain on sale of loans and a $961,000 negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights which were partially offset by an
increase of $259,000 in servicing revenue and a decrease of $530,000 in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights expense. The negative change of $961,000 in servicing rights valuation adjustments was due to a recapture of $353,000 in 2010
compared with a recapture of $1.3 million in 2009. This was driven by a steady increase in market mortgage rates during 2009. This increase in rates decreased the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing rights. First Defiance originated
$388.1 million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2010 compared with $513.6 million in 2009. The primary reason for the decrease was the low interest rate environment in the first half of 2009 which led to higher
refinance activity. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance stands at $1.5 million at the end of 2011. See Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Insurance and investment commission income increased $2.0 million or 38.3% in 2011 primarily due to the acquisition of
PDI, a full insurance agency which closed on July 1, 2011, coupled with an increase in contingent income of $226,000. The PDI acquisition added approximately $1.2 million in revenue in 2011. Contingent commissions are bonus payments received by
First Defiances insurance subsidiary for effective underwriting. Insurance and investment commission income increased $119,000 or 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to an increase in employee benefits premiums of $469,000 mostly offset by a decline in
contingent income of $328,000. In May 2010, First Insurance acquired a group medical benefits business line from Andres ONeil & Lowe Insurance Agency. 
Noninterest Expense  Total noninterest expense for 2011 was $62.8 million compared to $63.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2011 total includes $234,000 of acquisition related charges and the 2010 total includes $63,000 of acquisition related charges.
Noninterest expense, excluding the acquisition related charges in 2011 and 2010 was $62.5 million and $63.4 million, respectively.  Compensation and benefits increased $4.2 million or 15.2% in 2011 to $31.6 million from $27.4 million in 2010. The increase in compensation and benefits is due to the Company freezing pay in 2010, an
increase in health care costs of $813,000 due to an increase in claims, the acquisition of PDI which added approximately $797,000 in compensation and benefits expense and an increase in incentive expense of $1.5 million as a direct reflection of the
improved financial performance of the Company. FDIC insurance costs decreased $844,000 or 22.4% to $2.9 million from $3.8 million in 2010. The decrease reflects the change in the assessment rate calculation per the Dodd-Frank regulations. Data
processing decreased $652,000 or 13.3% in 2011 to $4.3 million from $4.9 million in 2010 as the Company gained efficiencies from switching to a new core systems provider in late 2010. The other noninterest expense category (including acquisition
related charges in 2011 and 2010) decreased $3.5 million due to credit, collection and OREO charges decreasing $2.1 million and $1.3 million of core conversion related costs recorded in 2010. 
Compensation and benefits decreased $495,000 or 1.8% in 2010 to $27.4 million from $27.9 million in 2009. Compensation
declined $813,000 due to the reduction of approximately 17 full time equivalent positions during the year. Throughout 2009 and 2010, the Company focused on staffing levels and worked to reduce levels without negatively impacting our level of
customer service. Work patterns and volumes did change in 2009 due in large part to the economy and lower levels of commercial

lending. This decline was partially offset by an increase of $319,000 in benefits and other associated costs. Occupancy cost decreased $804,000 or 10.2% in 2010 to $7.0 million from $7.9 million
in 2009. The Company made the decision to close two branch facilities and relocate a third during the fourth quarter of 2009. The closures were completed in January 2010. The costs associated with these closures were reflected in the fourth quarter
of 2009 and recorded in other operating expense. FDIC insurance costs increased $416,000 or 12.4% to $3.8 million from $3.4 million in 2009. The increase reflects a general increase in premium rates. Data processing increased $368,000 or 8.1% in
2010 to $4.9 million from $4.5 million in 2009. The other noninterest expense category (including acquisition related charges in 2010) increased $3.4 million due to credit, collection and OREO charges increasing $2.1 million, legal and consulting
increasing $284,000, and $1.3 million of core conversion related costs which were partially offset by a reduction on the loss on the sale of fixed assets of $549,000. 
Income Taxes  Income taxes amounted to $6.7 million in 2011 compared to $3.0 million in 2010
and $2.7 million in 2009. The effective tax rates for those years were 30.0%, 27.0%, and 27.0%, respectively. The tax rate is lower than the statutory 35% tax rate for the Company mainly because of investments in tax-exempt securities. The earnings
on tax-exempt securities are not subject to federal income tax. See Note 19  Income Taxes in the Notes to the financial statements for further details.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial institutions such
as First Defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the
terms of the loan or investment agreement. This possibility is known as credit risk.  Lending or investing
activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the Company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk. Diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a
financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk. Examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution.
Management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels. First Defiances loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest Ohio,
northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has also identified lending for income-generating rental properties as an industry concentration. Total loans for income generating property totaled $373.6 million at
December 31, 2011, which represents 25.7% of the Companys loan portfolio. Management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending. Loans in this category are generally paying as agreed
without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency. The delinquency rate in this category, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, was 5.42% at December 31, 2011. There are no other industry concentrations that exceed 10% of the
Companys loan portfolio.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The Companys primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base, raised through First Federals branch
network, along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base. These funds, along with investment securities, provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments. 
Cash generated from operating activities was $38.5 million, $32.2 million and $23.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans (less the origination of loans held for sale), the provision for loan
losses, depreciation expense, the origination, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities.

The primary investing activity of First Defiance is lending, which is
funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities, as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities. On July 1, 2011, First Defiance completed the acquisition of a full
insurance agency from Payak-Dubbs Insurance Agency, Inc. for $4.0 million in cash. Also in 2011, the Company purchased $25.8 million in portfolio residential home loans. On May 10, 2010, First Defiance completed the acquisition of a line of
business from Andres ONeil & Lowe for $1.5 million in cash.  In considering the more typical
investing activities, during 2011, $52.1 million and $8.7 million was generated from the combination of maturity, pay-downs, calls or sale of available-for-sale investment securities and $31.1 million was provided by a decline in loan growth while
$120.5 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities. During 2010, $46.8 million and $448,000 was generated from the maturity, pay-downs, calls or sale of available-for-sale investment securities and $53.8 million was
provided by a decline in loan growth while $76.4 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities. During 2009, $25.8 million and $6.4 million was generated from the maturity or sale of available-for-sale investment securities,
while $35.6 million was used to fund loan growth and $52.6 million was used to purchase available-for-sale investment securities.  Principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits, the utilization of FHLB advances, and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other
banks. For 2011, total deposits increased by $21.3 million. The amount of deposits acquired from out of market sources decreased in 2011 by $31.1 million. For 2010, total deposits decreased by $4.5 million. The amount of deposits acquired from out
of market sources decreased in 2010 by $5.6 million. For 2009, total deposits increased by $110.6 million, including $101.4 million of growth in retail deposits. The amount of deposits acquired from out of market sources increased in 2009 by $8.9
million. In 2011, securities sold under repurchase arrangements increased by $4.1 million and the Company completed its common stock offering that increased the financing activities by $19.9 million. Also in 2010, securities sold under repurchase
arrangements increased by $7.8 million. In 2009, short-term advances from the FHLB decreased by $9.1 million and there were no borrowings on lines of credit from other banks. Also securities sold under repurchase arrangements decreased by $1.1
million. For additional information about cash flows from First Defiances operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 In addition to the above commitments, at December 31, 2011 First Defiance had
commitments to sell $34.5 million of loans to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHLB of Cincinnati or BB&T Mortgage. 
To meet its obligations management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest
rate environments; it can sell or securitize mortgage and non-mortgage loans; and it can turn to other sources of financing including FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Bank, and brokered certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2011, First
Defiance had $147.9 million capacity under its agreements with the FHLB.  First Federal is subject to various
capital requirements of the OCC. At December 31, 2011, First Federal had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized. For additional information about First Defiance and First Federals capital
requirements, see Note 18  Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated December 31, 2011 Financial Statements.  Critical Accounting
Policies  First Defiance has established various accounting policies that govern the application of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of its financial statements. The significant accounting policies of First Defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain
accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies.
The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual
results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of First Defiance. 
Allowance for Loan Losses  First Defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting
policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. In determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses, management considers a number of factors
relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro-economic factors relative to the economy of the United States as a whole and the economy of the northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan regions in which the Company
does business. 
  -58-



Table of Contents
Factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a
customers payment history, a customers recent financial performance, an assessment of the value of collateral held, knowledge of the customers character, the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors, the existence of any
customer or industry concentrations, changes in a customers competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customers ability to meet his obligations. 
Economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation, specific plant or business closings in
the Companys market area, the impact of strikes or other work stoppages, the impact of weather or environmental conditions, especially relative to agricultural borrowers, and other matters that may have an impact on the economy as a whole.
 In addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems, management
considers its historical losses, the results of independent loan reviews, an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards, the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the Companys market area, and
other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified. Management believes that the level of its allowance for loan loss is sufficient to cover the estimates loss incurred but not yet recognized on the loan portfolio.
Refer to the section titled Allowance for Loan Losses and Note 2, Statement of Accounting Policies for a further description of the Companys estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses. 
Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights  First Defiance believes the valuation of mortgage servicing rights
is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. First Defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights, which are acquired through loan
origination activities. First Defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights.  Key assumptions made
by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing, assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages, the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or
ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream. In assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio, management utilizes a third party
that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios. That third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation. Prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for 15 and 30 year mortgage
backed securities. Those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan. The discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date. The value of
mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment. Refer also to the section entitled Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 2Statement of Accounting Policies, and Note 9Mortgage Banking, for a further
description of First Defiances valuation process, methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses.  Valuation of Securities  First Defiance believes the valuation of certain securities is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated
financial statements. This is pertaining to the Companys investment in certain trust preferred debt obligations securities (CDOs). As required by FASB ASC Topic 320, declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary, are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of other-than-temporary impairment that does
not relate to the credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair values of these CDOs, which are backed by trust preferred securities issued by banks, thrifts and insurance companies, have a fair value of $1.3 million. The
market for these securities at December 31, 2011 is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active. The inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid-ask spread in the brokered markets in which CDOs
trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels. The new issue market is also inactive as no new CDOs have been issued since 2007. There are currently very few market participants who are willing and/or
able to transact for these securities. 
  -59-



Table of Contents
The market values for these securities (and any securities other than those
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury) are very depressed relative to historical levels. Thus in todays market, a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general versus being an
indicator of credit problems with a particular issue.  Given the conditions in the debt markets today and the
absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets, management has determined: 1) The few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of determining fair value at
December 31, 2011; 2) An income valuation approach technique (present value technique) that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than the
market approach valuation used at the prior measurement dates and 3) The Companys CDOs will be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair
value at the measurement date.  The Companys CDO valuations were supported by an analysis prepared by an
independent third party. Their approach to determining fair value involved several steps: 1) Detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the CDO; 2) Collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the
CDO (default, recovery and prepayment/amortization probabilities) and 3) Discounted cash flow modeling.

Item 7a.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Asset/Liability Management  A significant portion of the
Companys revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and, accordingly, the Company strives to manage its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income.
Asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the Companys performance due to changes in interest rates. The Company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive
liabilities. First Defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management.  First Defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income. The simulation technique
analyzes the effect of a presumed 100 basis point shift in interest rates (which is consistent with managements estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations) and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial
instruments, loan and deposit volumes and rates, non-maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements. The results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise 100 basis points over a 24 month period, First
Defiances net interest income would increase by 8.55% over the base case scenario. It should be noted that other areas of First Defiances income statement, such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing
rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income.  The majority of First Defiances lending activities are in non-residential real estate and commercial loan areas. While such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending, they
tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans. The balance of First Defiances non-residential and multi-family real estate loan portfolio was $776.0 million, which was split between $136.7 million of fixed-rate loans and
$639.3 million of adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2011. The commercial loan portfolio decreased to $349.1 million, which is split between $106.0 million of fixed-rate loans and $243.1 million of adjustable-rate loans at December 31,
2011. Certain loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years. The maturities on fixed-rate loans are generally less than seven years. First Defiance also has significant balances of home equity
and improvement loans ($122.1 million at December 31, 2011) of which $74.9 million fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate. Approximately $47.2 million of home equity and improvement loans have fixed rates but the maturities on those
loans range from three to five years. First Defiance also has consumer loans ($18.9 million at December 31, 2011) which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans. Also, to limit its interest rate risk, as well as to
provide liquidity, First Federal sells a majority of its fixed-rate mortgage originations into the secondary market.  In addition to the simulation analysis, First Federal also prepares an economic value of equity (EVE) analysis. For 2011, this analysis calculates the net present value of First
Federals assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from 400 basis points to +400 basis points. The likelihood of a decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2011 was considered to be remote given the current
interest rate levels and therefore was not included in this analysis. The results of this analysis are reflected in the following table.

 The dollar and percentage change in the EVE analysis for 2011 is due to using bank
specific decay speeds on non maturity deposits beginning in September 2011 as opposed to using the OTS default speeds. This extended the duration on the funding base resulting in a higher valuation of capital in todays rate environment as well
as when term interest rates shift higher.  Based on the above analysis, in the event of a 200 basis point
increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2011, First Federal would experience a 9.89% increase in its economic value of equity. During periods of rising rates, the value of monetary assets declines. Conversely, during periods of falling
rates, the value of monetary assets increases. It should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment. Based on
the EVE analysis, the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is relatively low because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations. The average duration of its assets at
December 31, 2011 was 1.38 years while the average duration of its liabilities was 3.24 years.  In
evaluating First Federals exposure to interest rate risk, certain shortcomings inherent in each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or
periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other
types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates. Furthermore, in the event of changes in rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the
results therefore may differ from those presented.

Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The
management of First Defiance Financial Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.  Crowe Horwath LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, is included below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of First Defiance Financial Corp. (the
Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. We also have audited First
Defiance Financial Corp.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First Defiance Financial Corp. as of December 31, 2011 and
2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, First
Defiance Financial Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. Basis of Presentation 
First Defiance Financial Corp. (First Defiance or the Company) is a unitary thrift holding company that conducts
business through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, First Federal Bank of the Midwest (First Federal) and First Insurance Group of the Midwest, Inc., formerly First Insurance and Investments, Inc. (First Insurance). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.  First Federal is primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the
general public through its offices and using those and other available sources of funds to originate loans primarily in the counties in which its offices are located. First Federals traditional banking activities include originating and
servicing residential, commercial and consumer loans and providing a broad range of depository, trust and wealth management services. First Insurance is an insurance agency that does business in the Defiance, Archbold, Bryan, Bowling Green, Maumee
and Oregon, Ohio areas, offering property and casualty, and group health and life insurance products. On July 1, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of Payak-Dubbs Insurance Agency, Inc. (PDI), an independent property and casualty
insurance agency with two office locations based in Maumee, Ohio and Oregon, Ohio for a cash price of $4.8 million. PDI was merged into First Insurance. 
2. Statement of Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas where First Defiance uses estimates are the valuation of certain investment securities,
the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill, the determination of unrecognized income tax benefits, and the determination of post-retirement benefits. 
Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares (net income less dividend requirements for
preferred stock and accretion of preferred stock discount) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends
are considered participating securities for the calculation. Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under stock options, warrants, restricted stock awards and stock grants. Also
see Notes 5 and 20.  Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and the net
unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the Companys Defined Benefit Postretirement Medical Plan. All items included in other comprehensive income are reported net of tax. See also Notes 3, 6 and 17.

  -72-



Table of Contents
Cash Flows  Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks and overnight investments with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). Cash and amounts due from depository
institutions include required balances on hand or on deposit at the FHLB and Federal Reserve of approximately $1,649,000 and $2,279,000, respectively, at December 31, 2011 to meet regulatory reserve and clearing requirements. Net cash flows are
reported for customer loan and deposit transactions, interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and repurchase agreements. 
Investment Securities 
Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when First Defiance has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity and are reported at cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in
interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.  Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses
are included in gains (losses) on securities or other-than-temporary impairment losses on securities. Realized gains and losses on securities sold are recognized on the trade date based on the specific identification method. 
Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized on the level-yield method
without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are expected. Securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly to determine if value impairment is otherthan-temporary. In performing this review
management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition of the issuer, the impact of changes in market interest rates on market value and whether the Company intends to sell or it would be
more than likely required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment
through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and 2)
other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the
amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings.  FHLB Stock 
As a member of the FHLB System, First Federal is required to own stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati in an amount principally equal to 0.15%
of total assets plus an amount of at least 2% but no more than 4% of its non-grandfathered mission asset activity (as defined in the FHLBs regulations). First Federal is permitted to own stock in excess of the minimum requirement. FHLB stock
is a restricted equity security that does not have a readily determinable fair value and is carried at cost. It is evaluated for impairment based upon the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. At
December 31, 2011, the balance at FHLB of Cincinnati was $19.3 million. First Federal acquired $2.0 million of stock from the Pavilion acquisition which is held at the FHLB of Indianapolis and is required to be held for five years from the date
of acquisition of March 14, 2008. The balance of this stock was $1.3 million at December 31, 2011.

Table of Contents
Loans Receivable  Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs,
purchase premiums and discounts and the allowance for loan losses. Deferred fees net of deferred incremental loan origination costs, are amortized to interest income generally over the contractual life of the loan using the interest method without
anticipating prepayments. The recorded investment in loans includes accrued interest receivable and net deferred fees and costs and undisbursed loan amounts.  Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are classified as loans held for sale and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding
commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is
reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold. 
During 2011 and 2010, the Company realized losses totaling $413,000 and $477,000 pertaining to loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
but was returned due to underwriting issues. Repurchase losses are recognized when the Company determines they are probable and estimable. No amount was accrued at December 31, 2011 and 2010 for such losses. 
Interest receivable is accrued on loans and credited to income as earned. The accrual of interest on loans 90 days delinquent or impaired
is discontinued when, in managements opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. For these loans, interest accrual is only to the extent cash payments are received. The accrual of interest on these loans is
generally resumed after a pattern of repayment has been established and the collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. 
Acquired Loans 
Valuation allowances for all acquired loans subject to FASB ASC Topic 310 reflect only those losses incurred after acquisitionthat
is, the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition that are not expected to be collected.  The Company acquires loans
individually and in groups or portfolios. At acquisition, the Company reviews each loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the loans contractual terms. If both conditions exist, the Company determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into pools of loans based on common risk
characteristics (credit score, loan type and date of origination). The Company considers expected prepayments, and estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (expected at acquisition) for each
loan and subsequently aggregated pool of loans.  The Company determines the excess of the loans or pools scheduled
contractual principal and contractual interest payments over all cash flows expected at acquisition as an amount that should not be accreted (nonaccretable difference). The remaining amountrepresenting the excess of the loans cash flows
expected to be collected over the amount paidis accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). 
  -74-



Table of Contents
Over the life of the loan or pool, the Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to
be collected, and evaluates whether the present value of its loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased and, if so, recognizes a loss. The present value of any subsequent increase in the loans or pools actual cash
flows or cash flows expected to be collected is used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool. For any remaining increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company adjusts the amount of accretable yield
recognized on a prospective basis over the loans or pools remaining life.  Allowance for Loan Losses 
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan
portfolio and is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, an assessment of individual problem loans, actual loss experience, current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas and other pertinent
factors, including general economic conditions. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools
of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available
for any loan that, in managements judgment, should be charged off.  Loan losses are charged off against the allowance
when in managements estimation it is unlikely that the loan will be collected, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan loss is charged to operations based on managements
periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed adequate by management. The determination of whether a loan is considered past due or
delinquent is based on the contractual payment terms.  The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific
component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired.  A loan is impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loans agreement. Loans, for which terms have been modified and for which the borrower is experiencing
financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Generally, loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring are reviewed and an allowance for loan loss is established for any collateral shortfall. In
some cases where there is an interest rate reduction, a cash flow analysis of the net present value is performed and an allowance may be established based on the outcome of that analysis. All modifications are reviewed by the Banks senior loan
committee to determine whether or not the modification constitutes a troubled debt restructure. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are individually evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so
that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loans existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous
loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. 
The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical
loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent two years. Loss experience is adjusted for other economic factors based on the identified risks, credit
related or trends present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in 
  -75-

delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards;
other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit
concentrations. The following portfolio segments have been identified: commercial real estate (consisting of multi-family residential and non-residential), commercial, consumer, residential real estate, construction, consumer, and home equity and
improvement.  Servicing Rights  Servicing rights are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans. Servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales
of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation
model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and
default rates and losses. The Company compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization
method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. 
Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is
determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair
value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation
allowances are reported with mortgage banking income on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
 Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement with mortgage banking income, is recorded for fees earned for
servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee
income. Servicing fees, net of amortization of mortgage servicing rights (excluding valuation adjustments) totaled $1.2 million, $477,000 and $(311,000) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Late fees and ancillary fees related
to loan servicing are not material. See Note 9.  Bank Owned Life Insurance 
The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key employees. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can
be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.

Premises and Equipment and Long Lived Assets 
Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization computed principally by
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:   








 Buildings and improvements
  
 
20 to 50 years
  

 Furniture, fixtures and equipment
  
 
3 to 15 years
  
 Long-lived assets to be held and those to be disposed of and certain intangibles are periodically
evaluated for impairment. See Note 10.  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any
noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an
indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.  Other intangible assets consist of core deposit and acquired customer relationship intangible assets arising from whole bank, insurance and branch acquisitions. They are initially recorded at fair value
and then amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated lives, which range from five years for non-compete agreements to 10 to 20 years for core deposit and customer relationship intangibles. See Note 11. 
Real Estate and Other Assets Held for Sale  Other assets held for sale are comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These assets are initially recorded at fair value less costs
to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Losses arising from the acquisition of such property are charged against the allowance for loan losses at the time of acquisition. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value,
less estimated costs to dispose. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, the property is written down against expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed.  Stock Compensation Plans  Compensation cost is recognized for stock options
and restricted share awards issued to employees and directors, based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. Compensation cost is recognized over the
required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. See Note 21. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the
estimates.

Transfers of Financial Assets 
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred
assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and the
Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. 
Mortgage Banking Derivatives  Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as free standing
derivatives. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest on the loan is locked. The Company enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans
when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking income. 
Operating Segments 
Management considers the following factors in determining the need to disclose separate operating segments: 1) The nature of products and
services, which are all financial in nature; 2) The type and class of customer for the products and services; in First Defiances case retail customers for retail bank and insurance products and commercial customers for commercial loan,
deposit, life, health and property and casualty insurance needs; 3) The methods used to distribute products or provide services; such services are delivered through banking and insurance offices and through bank and insurance customer contact
representatives. Retail and commercial customers are frequently targets for both banking and insurance products; 4) The nature of the regulatory environment; both banking and insurance entities are subject to various regulatory bodies and a number
of specific regulations.  Quantitative thresholds as stated in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting are monitored. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the reported revenue for First Insurance was 7.1% of total revenue for First Defiance. Total revenue
includes net interest income (before provision for loan losses) plus non-interest income. Net income for First Insurance for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 2.9% of consolidated net income. Total assets of First Insurance at
December 31, 2011 were 0.7% of total assets. First Insurance does not meet any of the quantitative thresholds of FASB ASC Topic 280. Accordingly, all of the financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one
reportable segment.  Dividend Restriction  Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the savings bank to the holding company. See Note 18 for further details on restrictions. 
Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments  Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these
items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. 
  -78-



Table of Contents
Loss Contingencies  Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be
reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Income Taxes  Income tax
expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying
amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income and recoverable taxes paid in prior years. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
 An effective tax rate of 35% is used to determine after-tax components of other comprehensive income (loss) included in the
statements of stockholders equity. See Note 19.  A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on
examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.  The Company recognizes
interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  Retirement Plans 
Pension expense is the net of service and interest cost, return on plan assets and amortization of gains and losses not immediately
recognized. Employee 401(k) plan expense is the amount of matching contributions. Deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plan expense allocates the benefits over years of service.  Reclassifications  Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to
conform to the current presentation.  Accounting Standards Updates 
In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-02, A Creditors Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt
Restructuring, updated to amend previous guidance with respect to troubled debt restructurings. This updated guidance is designed to assist creditors with determining whether or not a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt
restructuring. In particular, additional guidance has been added to help creditors determine whether a concession has been granted and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. Both of these conditions are required to be met for
a restructuring to 
  -79-



Table of Contents

constitute a troubled debt restructuring. The amendments in the update are effective for the first interim period beginning on or after June 15, 2011, and should be applied
retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. The provisions of this update did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in
U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The amendments in this ASU generally represent clarifications of Topic 820, but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value
measurements has changed. This ASU results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The amendments in this ASU are to be
applied prospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application by public entities is not permitted. The amendments of this update are not expected
to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2011, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Amendments to Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. Under the amendments in this ASU, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of
other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income,
each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. This ASU eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the
statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments in this ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The
amendments of this ASU should be applied retrospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted because
compliance with the amendments is already permitted. The amendments do not require any transition disclosures. The provisions of this update are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.  In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The
provisions of ASU No. 2011-08 permits an entity an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity believes,
as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required.
ASU No. 2011-08 includes examples of events and circumstances that may indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. The provisions of ASU No. 2011-08 are effective for annual and interim goodwill
impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test for goodwill. The provisions of this update are not expected to
have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2011, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update
No. 2011-05. ASU 2011-12 defers changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments to allow the FASB time to re-deliberate whether to require presentation of such adjustments on the face of the
financial statements to show the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive

income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-12 allows entities to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent
with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU 2011-05. All other requirements in ASU 2011-05 are not affected by ASU 2011-12. ASU 2011-12 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

4. Acquisitions 
On July 1, 2011, First Defiance acquired PDI, an insurance agency headquartered in Maumee and Oregon, Ohio for a
cash purchase price $4.8 million and future consideration to be paid in cash in 2012 and 2013. As of December 31, 2011, management has reported goodwill of approximately $4.0 million and identifiable intangible assets of $1.5 million consisting
of customer relationship intangible of $947,000 and a non-compete intangible of $518,000. A contingent payable of $626,000 was also recorded in the transaction. The Company accounted for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting
which requires purchased assets and assumed liabilities to be recorded at their respective acquisition date fair value. Disclosure of pro forma results of this acquisition is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
 On May 10, 2010, First Defiance acquired a group medical benefits line of business from Andres ONeil &
Lowe Insurance Agency (AOL) for a cash purchase price of $1.5 million and future consideration to be paid in cash in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $971,200 and identifiable intangible assets of $735,800
consisting of a customer relationship intangible of $597,800 and a non-compete intangible of $138,000 and a recorded contingent payable of $207,000. Disclosure of pro forma results of this acquisition is not material to the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

First Defiance has the ability and intent to hold these investments for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost without impacting its liquidity position and it is not more than likely that
the Company will be required to sell the investments before anticipated recovery.  Realized gains from the sales and calls of
investment securities totaled $218,000 ($142,000 after tax) in 2011 while there were realized losses of $(8,000) and gains of $284,000 ($(5,000) and $185,000 after tax) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequent
when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments. Investment securities classified as available for sale or held-to-maturity are
generally evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC Topic 320. Certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC Topic 325, Investment  Other. 
When OTTI occurs under either model, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the
security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before
recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an
entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI shall be separated into the
amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected compared to the book value of the security
and is recognized in earnings. The amount of OTTI related to other factors shall be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings shall become the new
amortized cost basis of the investment.  In 2011, management determined that one CDO had OTTI resulting in a write-down of
$2,200 ($1,400 after tax). In 2010, management determined OTTI on three CDOs resulting in a write-down of $214,000 ($139,000 after tax). Also in 2010, management deemed it necessary based on the current economic conditions, to further write-down the
perpetual preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which resulted in a permanent write-down of $117,000 ($76,000 after tax). In 2009, management determined OTTI on nine CDOs resulting in a write-down of $3.9 million. 
The Company held nine CDOs at December 31, 2011. Four of those CDOs were written down in full prior to January 1, 2010. The
remaining five CDOs have a total amortized cost of $3.8 million at December 31, 2011. Of these, three, with a total amortized cost of $1.8 million, were identified as OTTI in prior periods. The final two CDOs, with a total amortized cost of
$2.0 million, continue to pay principal and interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the securities and no credit loss impairment has been identified in managements analysis. Therefore, these two CDO investments have not
been deemed by management to be OTTI.  Given the conditions in the debt markets today and the absence of observable
transactions in the secondary and new issue markets, the Companys CDOs will be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the
measurement date.

As required under FASB ASC Topic 320, declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. 
The Companys CDO valuations were supported by analysis prepared by an independent third party. Their approach to determining fair
value involved several steps: 1) detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the CDO; 2) collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the CDO (default, recovery and prepayment/amortization
probabilities) and 3) discounted cash flow modeling.  Trust Preferred CDOs Discount Rate Methodology 
First Defiance uses market-based yield indicators as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates, and then adjusts the resulting
discount rates on the basis of its credit and structural analysis of specific CDO instruments. The primary focus is on the returns a fixed income investor would require in order to allocate capital on a risk adjusted basis. There is currently no
active market for trust preferred CDOs, however, First Defiance looks principally to market yields for stand-alone trust preferred securities issued by banks, thrifts and insurance companies for which there is an active and liquid market. The next
step is to make a series of adjustments to reflect the differences that nevertheless exist between these products (both credit and structural) and, most importantly, to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences (both actual and projected)
between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific CDOs. Importantly, as part of the analysis described above, First Defiance considers the fact that structured instruments frequently exhibit leverage not present in stand-alone
instruments, and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect this additional risk.  Fundamental to this evaluation is an
assessment of the likelihood of CDO coverage test failures that would have the effect of diverting cash flow away from the relevant CDO bond for some period of time. Generally speaking, the Company adjusts indicative credit spreads upwards in the
case of CDOs that have relatively weaker collateral and/or less cushion with respect to overcollateralization and interest coverage test ratios and downwards if the reverse is true. This aspect of the Companys discount rate methodology is
important because there is frequently a great difference in the risks present in CDO instruments that are otherwise very similar (i.e. CDOs with the same basic type of collateral, the same manager, the same vintage, etc., may exhibit vastly
different performance characteristics). With respect to this last point, First Defiance notes that given todays credit environment, characterized by high default and deferral rates, it is typically the case that deal-specific credit
performance (determined on the basis of the credit characteristics of remaining collateral) is the best indicator of what a willing market participant would pay for an instrument. 
The Company uses the same methodology for all of its CDOs and believes its valuation methodology is appropriate for all of its CDOs in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320 as well as other related guidance.  The default and recovery probabilities for each piece
of collateral were formed based on the evaluation of the collateral credit and a review of historical industry default data and current/near-term operating conditions. For collateral that has already deferred, the Company assumed a recovery of 10%
of par for banks, thrifts or other depository institutions, and 15% for insurance companies. Although there is a possibility that the deferring collateral will become current at some point in the future, First Defiance has conservatively assumed
that it will continue to defer and gradually will default.

 The increase in OTTI in 2011 was the result of a slight deterioration in the performance of the
underlying collateral. Specifically, depreciation was driven by both realized credit events (i.e. defaults and deferrals) and weakening credit fundamentals in some of the performing collateral, which led to an increased probability of default going
forward. Excluding the Preferred Term VI, the Companys assumed average lifetime default rate declined to 28.3% at the end of 2011 from 36.1% at the end of 2010.  The table below presents a roll-forward of the credit losses relating to debt securities recognized in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):

7. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
Loan Commitments  Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of First Federals customers; however, there are no long-term, fixed-rate loan commitments that result in market risk. Standby letters of
credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. They primarily are issued to facilitate customers trade transactions. 
Both arrangements have credit risk, essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers, and are subject to the
Companys normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory and equipment) is obtained based on managements credit assessment of the customer. 
The Companys maximum obligation to extend credit for loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused lines of credit) and standby
letters of credit outstanding on December 31 was as follows (in thousands):

 Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 60 days or less. The fixed rate loan
commitments have interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 13.00% and maturities ranging from less than 1 year to 30 years.  In
addition to the above commitments, at December 31, 2011 First Defiance had commitments to sell $34.5 million of loans to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati or BB&T Mortgage.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
The Company has allocated $1.8 million and $2.3 million of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled
debt restructurings as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The Company has committed to lend additional amounts totaling up to $64,000 and $33,000 as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 to customers with
outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings.  During the twelve month period ending
December 31, 2011, the terms of certain loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings. The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an
extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan; or some other modification deeming the loan a troubled debt
restructuring.  Modifications involving a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan were for two loans. One loan was
for the remaining maturity of the loan, which is in 14 years, and the other was for 6 years, after which it will convert to a market rate for the remainder of the term. There were 7 modifications involving an extension of the maturity date and those
were for periods ranging from 4 months to 15 years.  The following table presents loans by class modified as troubled debt
restructurings that occurred during the period ending December 31, 2011:

 The troubled debt restructurings described above decreased the allowance for loan losses by $479,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2011, after $2.1 million of charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2011.  There
were 6 loans that defaulted during 2011 which had been modified within one year of the default date. Two of these loans totaling $967,000 were charged off in full prior to December 2011. The remaining 4 include two residential owner occupied loans
totaling $206,000, a commercial loan totaling $53,000, and an owner occupied CRE loan totaling $1.5 million. The $1.5 million owner occupied CRE loan is a golf course in which the borrower has negotiated a sale and is expected to payoff in the first
quarter of 2012. A default for purposes of this disclosure is a troubled debt restructured loan in which the borrower is 90 days past due.  In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the
foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed in an internal loan committee meeting.

Table of Contents
Credit Quality Indicators  Loans are categorized into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit
documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes all non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real
estate loans and certain homogenous mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. First Defiance uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves managements
close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institutions credit position at some future date. 
Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying
capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will
sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have
all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and
improbable.

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the
above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. As of December 31, 2011, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows: (In Thousands)

Certain loans acquired in the Pavilion Bancorp, ComBanc and Genoa acquisitions had evidence
that the credit quality of the loan had deteriorated since its origination and in managements assessment at the acquisition date it was probable that the First Defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due. In
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, these loans have been recorded based on managements estimate of the fair value of the loans. Details of these loans are

 Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with serviced loans were $9,057,000 and $8,509,000 at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Significant assumptions at December 31, 2011 used in determining the
value of MSRs include a weighted average prepayment rate of 329 PSA and a weighted average discount rate of 9.03%. Significant assumptions at December 31, 2010 used in determining the value of MSRs include a weighted average prepayment rate of
283 PSA and a weighted average discount rate of 9.00%.  A sensitivity analysis of the current fair value to immediate 10% and
20% adverse changes in those assumptions as of December 31, 2011 is presented below. These sensitivities are hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSR is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the discount rates), which might magnify or counteract the
sensitivities.

First Federal has the ability to borrow funds from the FHLB. First Federal pledges its single-family residential
mortgage loan portfolio, certain investment securities, certain first mortgage home equity loans, certain multi-family or non-residential real estate loans, and certain agriculture real estate loans as security for these advances. Advances secured
by investment securities must have collateral of at least 105% of the borrowing. Advances secured by residential mortgages must have collateral of at least 125% of the borrowings. Advances secured by multi-family or non-residential real estate
loans, and agriculture real estate loans must have 300% collateral coverage. The total level of borrowing is also limited to 50% of total assets and at least 50% of the borrowings must be secured by either one-to-four family residential mortgages or
investment securities. Total loans pledged to the FHLB at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were $640.2 million and $632.9 million, respectively. First Federal may obtain advances of up to approximately $147.9 million from

 Putable advances are callable at the option of the FHLB on a quarterly basis. Strike rate advances are
callable at the option of the FHLB only when three-month LIBOR rates exceed the agreed upon strike rate in the advance contract. Such strike rates range from 7.5% to 8.0%. When called, First Defiance has the option of paying off these advances or
converting them to variable rate advances at the three month LIBOR rate.  Estimated future minimum payments by fiscal year
based on maturity date and current interest rates are as follows (in thousands):

First Defiance also utilizes short-term advances from the FHLB to meet cash flow needs and
for short-term investment purposes. First Defiance borrows short-term advances under a variety of programs at FHLB. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under First Defiances Cash Management
Advance line of credit. The total available under this line is $15.0 million. In addition, First Defiance has a $100.0 million REPO Advance line of credit available. There were no borrowings against this line at December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2010. Amounts are generally borrowed under the Cash Management and REPO lines on an overnight basis. 
14. Junior Subordinated Debentures Owed to Unconsolidated Subsidiary Trust 
In March 2007, the Company sponsored an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust II (Trust Affiliate II) that
issued $15 million of Guaranteed Capital Trust Securities (Trust Preferred Securities). In connection with the transaction, the Company issued $15.5 million of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (Subordinated Debentures) to Trust
Affiliate II. The Company formed Trust Affiliate II for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company.
The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate II are the sole assets of that trust. The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of this Trust (variable interest entity), therefore the trust is not consolidated in the Companys
financial statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate II are payable quarterly at a fixed rate equal to 6.441% for the first five years and a
floating interest rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.5%, repricing quarterly, thereafter.  The Trust Preferred Securities
issued by Trust Affiliate II are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company has entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities
subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on June 15, 2037, but may be redeemed at the Companys option at any time on or after June 15, 2012, or at any time upon certain
events.  The Company also sponsors an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust I (Trust Affiliate I), that issued $20
million of Trust Preferred Securities in 2005. In connection with this transaction, the Company issued $20.6 million of Subordinated Debentures to Trust Affiliate I. Trust Affiliate I was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities
to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Junior Debentures held by Trust Affiliate I are the sole assets of the trust. The Company is not
considered the primary beneficiary of this Trust (variable interest entity), therefore the trust is not consolidated in the Companys financial statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability. Distributions on the
Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.38%. The Coupon rate payable on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I was 1.73% and 1.67%
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively.  The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are subject to
mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company has entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The
Trust Preferred Securities and Junior Debentures mature December 15, 2035 but may be redeemed by the issuer at par after October 28, 2010.  Due to the Companys participation in the U.S. Treasurys CPP, permission must be obtained from the U.S. Treasury in order to call these securities.

 As of December 31, 2011, First Federal Bank had the following lines of credit facilities available
for short-term borrowing purposes:  A $10 million line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window
at an interest rate of 50 basis points over the fed funds rate. The fed funds rate as of December, 31, 2011 was 0.25%.  A $15 million line of credit with the Bank of America. The rate on this line of credit is Bank of Americas fed funds rate, which floats daily. 
As of December 31, 2010, First Defiance had no line of credit facilities available for short-term borrowing purposes. 
Further, the Company has agreed with its primary regulator not to incur, issue, renew or roll-over any debt, increase any current lines
of credit, or guarantee the debt of any entity without the Federal Reserves prior approval.

17. Postretirement Benefits 
First Defiance sponsors a defined benefit postretirement plan that is intended to supplement Medicare coverage for
certain retirees who meet minimum age requirements. First Federal employees who retired prior to April 1, 1997 who completed 20 years of service after age 40 receive full medical coverage at no cost. Such coverage continues for surviving
spouses of those participants for one year, after which coverage may be continued provided the spouse pays 50% of the average cost. First Federal employees retiring after April 1, 1997 are provided medical benefits at a cost based on their
combined age and years of service at retirement. Surviving spouses are also eligible for continued coverage after the retiree is deceased at a subsidy level that is 10% less than what the retiree is eligible for. First Federal employees retiring
before July 1, 1997 receive dental and vision care in addition to medical coverage. First Federal employees who retire after July 1, 1997 are not eligible for dental or vision care, but those retirees and their spouses each receive up to
$200 annually in a medical spending account. Funds in that account may be used for payment of uninsured medical expenses. 
First Federal employees who were born after December 31, 1950 are not eligible for the medical coverage described above at
retirement. Rather, a medical spending account of up to $10,000 (based on the participants age and years of service) will be established to reimburse medical expenses for those individuals. First Insurance employees who were born before
December 31, 1950 can continue coverage until they reach age 65, or in lieu of continuing coverage, can elect the medical spending account option, subject to eligibility requirements. Employees hired or acquired after January 1, 2003 are
eligible only for the medical spending account option.

18. Regulatory Matters 
First Federal is subject to minimum capital adequacy guidelines as set forth in regulations previously adopted by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) which are now enforced by the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators, which could have a
material impact on First Federals financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, First Federal must maintain capital amounts in excess of specified minimum ratios based
on quantitative measures of First Federals assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. 
  -117-



Table of Contents
Quantitative measures previously established by the OTS to ensure capital adequacy require
First Federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (as set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets. 
The following schedule presents First Federal Banks regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2011 and December 31,

 Core capital is computed as a percentage of adjusted total assets of $1.98 billion for the bank. Risk-based capital is computed as a percentage of
total risk-weighted assets of $1.66 billion for the Bank.  Management believes that, as of December, 31,
2011, First Federal Bank was well capitalized based on the ratios presented above.  First Federal Bank is subject
to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Regulatory authorities can initiate certain mandatory actions if First Federal Bank fails to meet the
minimum capital requirements, which could have a direct material effect on the Corporations financial statements. Management believes, as of December 31, 2011, that First Federal Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which they
are subject.

First Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company and is regulated by the Federal Reserve.
At the present time, capital requirements for Savings and Loan Holding Companys have not been completed yet and therefore, First Defiance is not yet subject to regulatory capital requirements under the Federal Reserve. 
Dividend Restrictions  Dividends paid by First Federal to First Defiance are subject to various regulatory restrictions.
First Federal did not pay dividends in 2011 and paid $4.8 million in dividends in 2010. First Federal can initiate dividend payments equal to its net profits (as defined by statute) for 2010 and 2011 plus 2012 net profits. During 2012, First Federal
could declare dividends of approximately $20.6 million plus 2012 net profits to First Defiance. First Federal must receive approval from the OCC prior to the payment of any such dividend, and it may apply to the OCC to pay total dividends that
exceed an amount equal to its 2010 to 2012 net profits. First Insurance did not pay dividends to First Defiance in 2011 and paid $1.0 million in dividends in 2010.  As a result of its participation in the CPP, First Defiance is prohibited without prior approval of the U.S. Treasury, from paying a quarterly cash dividend of more than $0.26 per share until the U.S.
Treasurys preferred stock is redeemed or transferred to an unaffiliated third party. Further, First Defiance has agreed to obtain OCC approval prior to the declaration of dividends. First Defiance declared and paid a $0.05 per share common
stock dividend in December of 2011.

 The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Companys ability to
generate taxable income in future periods and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the same period. The Company has evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of its deferred tax assets and determined it is more likely
than not that the assets will be realized and thus no valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2011.  At
December 31, 2011, the Company had capital loss carry-forwards of $1.8 million which will expire on December 31, 2014. No valuation allowance has been recorded as management has evaluated evidence supporting the realization of this asset
and determined it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.  Retained earnings at December 31, 2011
include approximately $11.0 million for which no tax provision for federal income taxes has been made. This amount represents the tax bad debt reserve at December 31, 1987, which is the end of the Companys base year for purposes of
calculating the bad debt deduction for tax purposes. If this portion of retained earnings is used in the future for any purpose other than to absorb bad debts, the amount used will be added to future taxable income. The unrecorded deferred tax
liability on the above amount at December 31, 2011 was approximately $3.85 million.

 The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or
decrease in the next twelve months.  The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the income statement, net of the
related federal tax benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $14,000, and the amount accrued for interest and penalties (net of the related federal tax benefit) at December 31, 2011 was $73,000. 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in the state of Indiana. The Company is no
longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2007. The Company currently operates primarily in the states of Ohio and Michigan, which tax financial institutions based on their equity rather than their income. 
20. Employee Benefit Plans 
401(k) Plan  Employees of First Defiance are eligible to participate in the First Defiance Financial Corp. 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (First Defiance 401(k)) if they meet certain age and service requirements.
Beginning in 2009, under the First Defiance 401(k), First Defiance matches 100% of the participants contributions up to 3% of compensation and then 50% of the participants contributions for the next 2% of compensation. Previously,
matching contributions were 50% of the first 3% of participants contributions. The First Defiance 401(k) also provides for a discretionary First Defiance contribution in addition to the First Defiance matching contribution. First Defiance matching
contributions totaled $717,000, $660,000 and $719,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no discretionary contributions in any of those years.

Group Life Plan  On June 30, 2010, First Federal adopted the First Federal Bank of the Midwest Executive Group Life Plan  Post Separation (the Group Life Plan) in which various employees, including
the Companys named executive officers, may participate. Under the terms of the Group Life Plan, First Federal will purchase and own life insurance policies covering the lives of employees selected by the board of directors of First Federal as
participants. There was $137,000 and $547,000 of expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, with a liability of $683,000 and $547,000 for future benefits recorded at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. 
21. Stock Option Plans 
First Defiance has established incentive stock option plans for its directors and employees. On March 15, 2010,
the Board adopted, and the shareholders approved at the 2010 Annual Shareholders Meeting, the First Defiance Financial Corp. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2010 Equity Plan). The 2010 Equity Plan replaces all existing plans. All awards
currently outstanding under the prior plans will remain in effect in accordance with their respective terms. Any new awards will be made under the 2010 Equity Plan. The 2010 Equity Plan allows for issuance of up to 350,000 option or restricted share
awards.  As of December 31, 2011, 317,800 options have been granted and remain outstanding at option prices based on the
market value of the underlying shares on the date the options were granted. Options granted under all plans vest 20% per year except for the 2009 grant to the Companys executive officers, which vest 40% in 2011 and then 20%
annually, subject to certain other limitations required by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. All options expire ten years from date of grant. Vested options of retirees expire on the earlier of the scheduled expiration date or three
months after the retirement date.  On August 15, 2011, the Company approved a Short-Term and a Long-Term Equity Incentive
Plan for selected members of management. The Plans are effective January 1, 2011 and provide for cash and/or equity benefits if certain performance targets are achieved. Awards issued under these Plans will reduce the amount of awards available
to be issued under the 2010 Equity Plan.  The Short-Term Equity Incentive Plan includes nine members of management. These
participants may earn up to 25% to 45% of their 2011 salary for potential payout under the Short-Term Equity Incentive Plan. The final amount of benefit was determined at December 31, 2011 based on the achievement of certain targets which each
contribute from 10% to 25% of the total potential benefit earned. The targets include diluted earnings per share, net charge offs to average loans, non-performing assets to total assets, classified assets to total assets, return on average equity
and return on average assets. Two of the Participants in the Plan are high-compensated employees (HCEs) who are not eligible to receive cash payments and therefore their total potential benefit will be paid out as restricted share
awards. These participants earned a total of 13,554 awards as a result of targets being achieved. The expense associated with payment of these awards was considered an equity arrangement for accounting purposes and was accounted for as a component
of equity. For the year ended December 31, 2011 total expense of $162,000 has been recorded through equity associated with the estimated benefits to these participants. The remaining participants have the option to receive their potential
benefits in cash, restricted share awards, or a combination thereof. Accordingly any expense associated with payment of these benefits is considered a liability award for accounting purposes and will be accounted for as an accrued liability. For the
year ended December 31, 2011 total expense of $220,000 was recorded and is included within other liabilities. The benefits earned under this plan will be paid out as follows 50% in the first quarter of 2012, 25% in the first quarter of 2013,
and 25% in the first quarter of 2014. The participants are required to be employed on the day of payout in order to receive such payment.

Table of Contents
The Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan includes nine members of management. These participants
may earn up to 25% to 45% of their 2011 salary for potential payout under the Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan. The final amount of benefit will be determined at December 31, 2012 based on the achievement of certain targets which each contribute
from 33% to 34% of the total potential benefit earned. The targets include a peer comparison of return on average equity, earnings per share growth and revenue growth. Two of the Participants in the Plan are high-compensated employees
(HCEs) who are not eligible to receive cash payments and therefore their total potential benefit will be paid out as restricted share awards. These participants may earn up to a maximum of 13,554 awards if all targets are achieved.
Any estimated expense associated with payment of these awards is considered an equity arrangement for accounting purposes and will be accounted for as a component of equity. For the year ended December 31, 2011 total expense of $49,000 has been
recorded through equity associated with the estimated benefits to these participants. The remaining participants have the option to receive their potential benefits in cash, restricted share awards, or a combination thereof. Accordingly any expense
associated with payment of these benefits is considered a liability award for accounting purposes and will be accounted for as an accrued liability. For the year ended December 31, 2011 total expense of $60,000 was recorded and is included
within other liabilities. The benefits earned under this plan will be paid out in full in the first quarter of 2013. The participants are required to be employed on the day of payout in order to receive such payment. 
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model using the assumptions noted in the
table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Companys common stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is
based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.  The fair value of options granted was determined using the following
weighted-average assumptions as of grant date.

 As of December 31, 2011, there was $122,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options granted under the Company Stock Option Plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.  In March 2011, First Defiance granted restricted stock awards (RSA) under the 2010 Equity Plan, which provides for the issuance of shares to directors, officers and employees. Compensation
expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at issue date. The fair value of the stock was determined using the closing price of First Defiance common stock on the date of the grant. The
restricted stock shares fully vest on the second anniversary of the grant date.

23. Fair Value 
FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a
principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly
transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced
transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact. 
FASB ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the
cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as
cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). Valuation techniques should be
consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available. In that regard, FASB ASC Topic 820 established a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:   


 

 
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access
at the measurement date. 
  -126-



Table of Contents


 

 
 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other that quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability (such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by a correlation or other means. 
 


 

 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for determining fair value of assets and liabilities that reflect an entitys own assumptions about the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  A description of the
valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 
Available for sale securities - Securities classified as available for sale are generally reported at fair value utilizing Level 2
inputs where the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service which uses matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted
prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads,
cash flows and the bonds terms and conditions, among other things. Securities in Level 1 include preferred stock securities. Securities in Level 2 include U.S. Government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and municipal
securities. The Company classifies its pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations as Level 3. The portfolio consists of collateralized debt obligations backed by pools of trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and
insurance companies. Based on the lack of observable market data, the Company estimated fair values based on the observable data available and reasonable unobservable market data. The Company estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow
model which used appropriately adjusted discount rates reflecting credit and liquidity risks. The Company used an independent third party which is described further in Note 6.  Impaired loans - The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan loss is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single
valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data
available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in impaired loans being valued using Level 3 inputs. 
Mortgage servicing rights - Mortgage servicing rights are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. MSRs are valued by a
third party consultant using a proprietary cash flow valuation model.

Mortgage banking derivative - The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives are
based on derivative valuation models using market data inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2).  Real estate held for
sale - Real estate held for sale is determined using Level 3 inputs which include current and prior appraisals and estimated costs to sell.

value:  Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis

 Impaired loans, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral
dependent loans, had a fair value of $10.9 million, with a valuation allowance of $7.2 million at December 31, 2011. A provision expense of $5.4 million for year ended December 31, 2011 was included in earnings. 
Mortgage servicing rights which are carried at lower of cost or fair value had a fair value of $8,690,000 at December 31, 2011,
resulting in a valuation allowance of $1,529,000. A charge of $404,000 was included in the earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Real estate held for sale is determined using Level 3 inputs which include current and prior appraisals and estimated costs to sell. The change in fair value of real estate held for sale was $1,047,000
for the year ended December 31, 2011 was recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings through non-interest expense.  Impaired loans, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a fair value of $27.6 million, with a valuation allowance of $16.6 million at
December 31, 2010. A provision expense of $18.0 million for year ended December 31, 2010 was included in earnings.

Table of Contents
Mortgage servicing rights which are carried at lower of cost or fair value had a fair value
of $9,477,000 at December 31, 2010, resulting in a valuation allowance of $1,125,000. A recovery of $353,000 was included in the earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010. 
Real estate held for sale is determined using Level 3 inputs which include current and prior appraisals and estimated costs to sell. The
change in fair value of real estate held for sale was $3,196,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 was recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings through non-interest expense. 
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825, the following table is a comparative condensed consolidated statement of financial condition based
on carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of First Defiance.
 Much of the information used to arrive at fair value is highly subjective and judgmental in nature and therefore
the results may not be precise. Subjective factors include, among other things, estimated cash flows, risk characteristics and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. With the exception of investment securities, the Companys
financial instruments are not readily marketable and market prices do not exist. Since negotiated prices for the instruments, which are not readily marketable depend greatly on the motivation of the buyer and seller, the amounts that will actually
be realized or paid per settlement or maturity of these instruments could be significantly different.  The carrying amount of
cash and cash equivalents, warehouse and term notes payable, and advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance, and accrued interest receivable and payable as a result of their short-term nature, is considered to be equal to fair value.
 As disclosed in more detail in Note 6, investment securities fair value has been based on current market quotations. If
market prices are not available, fair value has been estimated based upon the quoted price of similar instruments or based on observable and unobservable data. It was not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions
placed on its transferability.  The fair value of loans which reprice within 90 days is equal to their carrying amount. For
other loans, the estimated fair value is calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms. The allowance for loan losses is considered to be a reasonable adjustment for
credit risk.  FASB ASC Topic 825 requires that the fair value of demand, savings, NOW and certain money market accounts be
equal to their carrying amount. The Company believes that the fair value of these deposits may be greater or less than that prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 825. 
  -131-



Table of Contents
The carrying value of Subordinated Debentures and deposits with fixed maturities is
estimated based on interest rates currently being offered on instruments with similar characteristics and maturities. FHLB advances with maturities greater than 90 days are valued based on discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates
currently being quoted for similar characteristics and maturities. The cost or value of any call or put options is based on the estimated cost to settle the option at December 31, 2011.

24. Derivative Financial Instruments 
Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward
commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives. It is the Companys practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate
lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated in hedge relationships. First Federal
had approximately $21.7 million and $24.9 million of interest rate lock commitments at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were $34.4 million and $34.7 million of forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage
loans at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are reflected by
a derivative asset or a derivative liability. The table below provides data about the carrying values of these derivative instruments:

 The above amounts are included in mortgage banking income with gain on sale of mortgage loans. During the
first quarter of 2011, management determined that a group of loans, previously classified as held for sale, were no longer sellable and were transferred back into the portfolio. As a result, a $90,000 loss related to a fair value adjustment on those
loans was recorded in the first quarter of 2011.

26. Preferred Stock 
On December 5, 2008, as part of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the Company entered into a Letter
Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Purchase Agreement) with the U.S. Treasury, pursuant to which the Company sold $37.0 million shares of newly authorized Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share and liquidation value $1,000 per share (Senior Preferred Shares) and also issued warrants (the Warrants) to the U.S. Treasury to acquire an additional 550,595 of common shares having an exercise price of
$10.08 per share. The Warrants have a term of 10 years.  The Senior Preferred Shares qualify as Tier 1 capital and will pay
cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter. The Senior Preferred Shares may be redeemed by the Company after three years. The Senior Preferred Shares are not subject to any
contractual restrictions on transfer, except that the U.S. Treasury or any its transferees may affect any transfer that, as a result of such transfer, would require the Company to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the ability
of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, its common shares will be subject to restrictions, including a restriction against increasing dividends from the last
quarterly cash dividend per share of $0.26 declared on the common stock prior to October 14, 2008. The redemption, purchase or other acquisition of trust preferred securities of the Company or its affiliates also will be restricted. These
restrictions will terminate on the earlier of (a) the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the Senior Preferred Shares and (b) the date on which the Senior Preferred Shares have been redeemed in whole or the U.S. Treasury has
transferred all of the Senior Preferred Shares to third parties, except that, after the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the Senior Preferred Shares, if the Senior Preferred Shares remain outstanding at such time, the Company may not
increase its common dividends per share without obtaining consent of the U.S. Treasury. 
  -135-



Table of Contents
The Purchase Agreement also subjects the Company to certain of the executive compensation
limitations included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA). As a condition to the closing of the transaction, the Companys Senior Executive Officers (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (the Senior
Executive Officers), (i) voluntarily waived any claim against the U.S. Treasury or the Company for any changes to such officers compensation or benefits that are required to comply with the regulation issued by the U.S. Treasury
under the CPP and acknowledged that the regulation may require modification of the compensation, bonus, incentive and other benefit plans, arrangements and policies and agreements as they relate to the period the U.S. Treasury owns the Senior
Preferred Shares of the Company; and (ii) entered into a letter agreement with the Company amending the Benefit Plans with respect to such Senior Executive Officers as may be necessary, during the period that the U.S. Treasury owns the Senior
Preferred Shares, as necessary to comply with Section 111(b) of the EESA.  The Company intends to redeem the Senior
Preferred Shares and the Warrants as soon as it is prudent to do so. However, there are three factors the Company will continue to consider when evaluating redemption: (a) evidence of a sustained economic recovery, (b) the Companys
sustained profitable performance with growth in earnings, and (c) additional clarity of any new regulatory capital thresholds. The Company anticipates that it will redeem the Senior Preferred Shares and the Warrants within five years from
the date of issuance, December 5, 2013, utilizing existing funds at that time. The companies earnings and capital levels have steadily improved over the past several quarters and the Company has seen improvement in the economic
environment it operates. While the Company still believes that more clarity of any new capital level requirements is necessary, the Company feels that its overall financial position has improved to a level that would indicate a higher likelihood
that the company would request approval for the repayment of TARP in the near term. 
27. Common Stock Offering 
In March 2011, the Company completed its previously announced underwritten public common stock offering by issuing
1,600,800 shares of the Companys common stock, including 208,800 shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, at a price of $13.25 per share for gross proceeds of $21.2 million. The net proceeds to
the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $19.9 million.
