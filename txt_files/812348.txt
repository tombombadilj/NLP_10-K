ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 The Company 
Century Bancorp, Inc. (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the Company) is a
Massachusetts state-chartered bank holding company headquartered in Medford, Massachusetts. The Company is a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1972 and has one banking subsidiary (the Bank): Century Bank and Trust Company formed
in 1969. At December 31, 2011, the Company had total assets of $2.7 billion. Currently, the Company operates 24 banking offices in 17 cities and towns in Massachusetts, ranging from Braintree in the south to Beverly in the north. The
Banks customers consist primarily of small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in these communities and surrounding areas, as well as local governments and institutions throughout Massachusetts. 
The Companys results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned
on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The results of operations are also affected by the level of income/fees from loans and deposits, as well as operating expenses, the provision for loan losses, the impact of
federal and state income taxes and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity.  The Company offers a wide
range of services to commercial enterprises, state and local governments and agencies, nonprofit organizations and individuals. It emphasizes service to small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in its market area. The Company makes
commercial loans, real estate and construction loans, and consumer loans and accepts savings, time and demand deposits. In addition, the Company offers to its corporate and institutional customers automated lockbox collection services, cash
management services and account reconciliation services, and it actively promotes the marketing of these services to the municipal market. Also, the Company provides full-service securities brokerage services through a program called Investment
Services at Century Bank, which is supported by LPL Financial, a full-service securities brokerage business.  The Company is
also a provider of financial services, including cash management, transaction processing and short-term financing, to municipalities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Company has deposit relationships with 188 (54%) of the 351 cities
and towns in Massachusetts.  Availability of Company Filings  Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 13 and 15(d), periodic and current reports must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The public may read and
copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0030.
The Company electronically files with the SEC its periodic and current reports, as well as other filings it makes with the SEC from time to time. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports and other information regarding issuers,
including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC, at www.sec.gov, in which all forms filed electronically may be accessed. Additionally, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports
on Form 8-K and additional shareholder information are available free of charge on the Companys website: www.centurybank.com. 
Employees  As of
December 31, 2011, the Company had 317 full-time and 88 part-time employees. The Companys employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that its employee relations are good. 
Financial Services Modernization  On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Gramm-Leach) which significantly altered banking laws in the United States. Gramm Leach enables
combinations among banks, securities firms and insurance companies beginning March 11, 2000. As a result of Gramm Leach, many of the 
  1 


Table of Contents

depression-era laws that restricted these affiliations and other activities that may be engaged in by banks and bank holding companies were repealed. Under Gramm-Leach, bank holding companies are
permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. 
In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board as a
financial holding company by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the
CRA). The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach.  These financial
activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment and
development and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a financial holding company. In order for the new financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach requires each of the parent bank
(and any bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that banks financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or
$50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if the bank is one of the 100 largest banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements. The Company does not currently conduct activities
through a financial subsidiary.  Gramm-Leach establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking
agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies and banks financial subsidiaries, the SEC will regulate their securities activities, and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities.
Gramm-Leach also provides new protections against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumers nonpublic, personal information.  Holding Company Regulation  The Company is a bank holding company as
defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Holding Company Act), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB), which is responsible for administration of
the Holding Company Act. Although the Company may meet the qualifications for electing to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach, the Company has elected to retain its pre-Gramm-Leach status for the present time under the Holding
Company Act. As required by the Holding Company Act, the Company files with the FRB an annual report regarding its financial condition and operations, management and intercompany relationships of the Company and the Bank. It is also subject to
examination by the FRB and must obtain FRB approval before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank, unless it already owns or controls a majority of the voting stock of that bank,
(ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, except through a subsidiary which is a bank, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. A bank holding company must also give the FRB prior
written notice before purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding
12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net worth.  The Holding Company Act prohibits a bank
holding company, with certain exceptions, from (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company which is not a bank or a bank holding company, or (ii) engaging in any
activity other than managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company may own, however, shares of a company engaged in activities which the FRB has determined are so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  The Company and its subsidiaries are
examined by federal and state regulators. The FRB has responsibility for holding company activities and performed a review of the Company and its subsidiaries as of September 2010.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
On December 19, 1991, the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (the 1991 Act) was enacted. This legislation provides for, among
other things: enhanced federal supervision of depository institutions, including greater authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for undercapitalized institutions; the establishment of risk-based deposit insurance premiums; a
requirement that the federal banking agencies amend their risk-based capital requirements to include components for interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities; expanded authority for cross-industry
mergers and acquisitions; mandated consumer protection disclosures with respect to deposit accounts; and imposed restrictions on the activities of state-chartered banks, including the Bank. 
Provisions of the 1991 Act relating to the activities of state-chartered banks significantly impact the way the Company conducts its
business. In this regard, the 1991 Act provides that insured state banks, such as the Bank, may not engage as principal in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank, unless the FDIC has determined that the activity would pose no
significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the state bank is in compliance with applicable capital standards. Activities of subsidiaries of insured state banks are similarly restricted to those activities permissible for
subsidiaries of national banks, unless the FDIC has determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the BIF and the state bank is in compliance with applicable capital standards. 
Interstate Banking  The
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the Interstate Banking Act), generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by
a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate
branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition; and operated de novo interstate branches whenever the host state opts-in to de
novo branching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and managed.  USA PATRIOT Act  Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, also known as
the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, all financial institutions are required in general to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or
prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. Additional information-sharing among financial
institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities is encouraged by the presence of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach Act for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the
Secretary of the Treasurer to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information-sharing. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by
the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed into law July 30, 2002, addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditor independence and
accounting standards, executive compensation, insider loans, whistleblower protection and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The SEC has adopted a substantial number of implementing rules and the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) has adopted corporate governance rules that have been approved by the SEC and are applicable to the Company. The changes are intended to allow stockholders to monitor more effectively the performance of companies and management. As
directed by Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are each required to certify that the Companys quarterly and annual reports do not contain any

  3 


Table of Contents

untrue statement of a material fact. This requirement has several parts, including certification that these officers are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; that they have made certain disclosures to the Companys auditors and the Board of Directors about the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and that they have included information in the Companys quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and whether there have been significant changes in the Companys internal disclosure controls and procedures or in other factors that could significantly affect such controls and
procedures subsequent to the evaluation and whether there have been any significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, and compliance with certain other disclosure objectives. Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an additional certification that each periodic report containing financial statements fully
complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial conditions and results of operations of the
Company.  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law. The Act was intended to address many
issues arising in the recent financial crisis and is exceedingly broad in scope affecting many aspects of bank and financial market regulation. The Act requires, or permits by implementing regulation, enhanced prudential standards for banks and bank
holding companies inclusive of capital, leverage, liquidity, concentration and exposure measures. In addition, traditional bank regulatory principles such as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders were enhanced. The Act also
contains reforms of consumer mortgage lending practices and creates a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection which is granted broad authority over consumer financial practices of banks and others. It is expected as the specific new or incremental
requirements applicable to the company become effective that the costs and difficulties of remaining compliant with all such requirements will increase. The Act broadens the base for FDIC assessments to average consolidated assets less tangible
equity of financial institutions and also permanently raises the current standard maximum FDIC deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The Act extends unlimited deposit insurance on non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31,
2012.  Deposit Insurance Premiums  The Banks deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the
risk category of an institution and the amount of assets that it holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis.  The Bank was also a participant in the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program as discussed within the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition under Recent
Market Developments.  On May 22, 2009, the FDIC announced a special assessment on insured institutions as part of its
efforts to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund and help maintain public confidence in the banking system. The special assessment is five basis points of each FDIC-insured depository institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital, as of
June 30, 2009. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2009 in connection with the special assessment.  On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter
of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The FDIC Board voted to adopt a uniform three-basis point increase in assessment rates effective on January 1, 2011, and extend the restoration period from seven to eight years. This rule was
finalized on November 2, 2009. As a result, the Company is carrying a prepaid asset of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2011. The Companys quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments will be paid from this amount until the
amount is exhausted or until December 30, 2014, when any amount remaining would be returned to the Company. 
  4 


Table of Contents
In February 2011, the FDIC approved a rule to change the assessment base from adjusted
domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The rule should keep the overall amount collected from the industry very close to the amount collected prior to the new calculation. 
Competition  The Company
experiences substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans from commercial banks, thrift institutions and other enterprises such as insurance companies and mutual funds. These competitors include several major commercial banks whose
greater resources may afford them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices and mount extensive advertising campaigns. A number of these competitors are not subject to the regulatory oversight that the Company is
subject to, which increases these competitors flexibility.  Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain statements contained herein are not based on historical facts and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements, which are based on various assumptions (some of which are beyond the Companys control), may be identified by a reference to a estimate,
anticipate continue or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of these terms. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors,
including, but not limited to, those related to the economic environment, particularly in the market areas in which the Company operates, competitive products and pricing, fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. Government, changes in
government regulations affecting financial institutions, including regulatory fees and capital requirements, changes in prevailing interest rates, acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, credit risk management, asset/liability
management, the financial and securities market and the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity.  The
Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or
circumstances after the date of such statements.   


ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS 
The risk factors that may affect the Companys performance and results of operations include the following: 
(i)  the Companys business is dependent upon general economic conditions in Massachusetts. The national
and local economies may adversely affect the Companys performance and results of operations; 
(ii)  the Companys earnings depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income generated by
the Company, and therefore the Companys results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve; 
(iii)  the banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the Company depends upon the
Companys ability to attract loans and deposits in Massachusetts, where the Company competes with a variety of traditional banking companies, some of which have vastly greater resources, and nontraditional institutions such as credit unions and
finance companies;  (iv)  at December 31, 2011, approximately 57.9% of the Companys loan
portfolio was comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible
factors, which are considered in making commercial loans;  (v)  at December 31, 2011,
approximately 35.6% of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk and the value of underlying collateral. Accordingly,
the Companys profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses, by loan defaults and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions; 
  5 


Table of Contents
(vi)  economic conditions and interest rate risk could adversely
impact the fair value and the ultimate collectability of the Companys investments. Should an investment be deemed other than temporarily impaired, the Company would be required to writedown the carrying value of the investment
through earnings. Such writedown(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations;  (vii)  writedown of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the purchase price which is
allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At December 31, 2011, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $2.8 million; 
(viii)  acts or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the United States or other governments as a result of
such acts or threats, including possible military action, could further adversely affect business and economic conditions in the United States of America generally and in the Companys markets, which could adversely affect the Companys
financial performance and that of the Companys borrowers and on the financial markets and the price of the Companys Class A common stock;  (ix)  changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing bank holding companies and their subsidiaries could alter the Companys business environment or affect the
Companys operations; and  (x) the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information
technology systems, on which the Company is highly dependent to secure bank and customer financial information, could present operational issues, require significant capital spending or impact the Companys reputation. 
These factors, as well as general economic and market conditions in the United States of America, may materially and adversely affect the
Companys performance, results of operations and the market price of shares of the Companys Class A common stock.   


ITEM 1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  No written comments received by the Company from the SEC regarding the Companys periodic or current reports remain unresolved. 
 


ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES 
The Company owns its main banking office, headquarters, and operations center in Medford, Massachusetts, which were expanded in 2004, and
11 of the 23 other facilities in which its branch offices are located. The remaining offices are occupied under leases expiring on various dates from 2012 to 2026. The Company believes that its banking offices are in good condition. 
During August 2009, the Company entered into a lease agreement to open a branch located at Coolidge Corner in Brookline, Massachusetts.
The branch opened on April 27, 2010.  During July 2010, the Company entered into a lease agreement to open a branch
located at Newton Centre in Newton, Massachusetts. The branch opened on June 20, 2011.  During September 2010, the Company
entered into a lease agreement to open a branch located in Andover, Massachusetts. The branch is scheduled to open during the first half of 2012.   


ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various claims and lawsuits arising in the course of their normal business activities. Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at
this time, it is the opinion of management that none of these matters, even if it resolved adversely to the Company, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position.

placed no deadline on the repurchase program. There were no shares purchased other than through a publicly announced plan or program.  The shares of Class A Common Stock are generally not entitled to vote on any matter, including in the election of Company Directors, but, in limited circumstances, may be entitled to vote as a class
on certain extraordinary transactions, including any merger or consolidation (other than one in which the Company is the surviving corporation or one which by law may be approved by the directors without any stockholder vote) or the sale, lease, or
exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company. Since the vote of a majority of the shares of the Companys Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, is required to approve certain extraordinary
corporate transactions, the holders of Class B Common Stock have the power to prevent any takeover of the Company not approved by them.  (b) Approximate number of equity security holders as of December 31, 2011:

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Certain statements contained herein are not based on historical facts and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements, which are based on various assumptions (some of which are beyond the Companys control), may be identified by reference to a future period or periods, or by
the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may, will, believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, continue or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the
negative of these terms. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the economic environment, particularly in the market
areas in which the Company operates, competitive products and pricing, fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. Government, changes in government regulations affecting financial institutions, including regulatory fees and capital requirements,
changes in prevailing interest rates, acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, credit risk management, asset/liability management, the financial and securities markets, and the availability of and costs associated with sources of
liquidity.  The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any
revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  RECENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  The financial services industry continues to
face unprecedented challenges in the aftermath of the recent national and global economic crisis. Since June 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most severe recession and financial crisis since the Great Depression. There have been
some improvements in private-sector employment, industrial production and U.S. exports; nevertheless, the pace of economic recovery has been extremely slow. The housing markets continue to be depressed. Financial markets have improved since the
depths of the crisis but are still unsettled and volatile. Investors have pulled back from risky assets. Lower equity prices and wider spreads on corporate bonds and other debt instruments and greater pressures on financial institutions have
resulted. At the same time, heightened demand for safe assets has put downward pressure on yields. There is continued concern about the U.S. economic outlook and the potential effects of the continued crisis in the European financial markets.
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law. The Act was intended to
address many issues arising in the recent financial crisis and is exceedingly broad in scope, affecting many aspects of bank and financial market regulation. The Act requires, or permits by implementing regulation, enhanced prudential standards for
banks and bank holding companies inclusive of capital, leverage, liquidity, concentration and exposure measures. In addition, traditional bank regulatory principles such as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders were enhanced. The
Act also contains reforms of consumer mortgage lending practices and creates a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is granted broad authority over consumer financial practices of banks and others. It is expected as the specific new or
incremental requirements applicable to the company become effective that the costs and difficulties of remaining compliant with all such requirements will increase. The Act broadens the base for FDIC assessments to average consolidated assets less
tangible equity of financial institutions and also permanently raises the current standard maximum FDIC deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The Act extends unlimited deposit insurance on non-interest bearing transaction accounts through
December 31, 2012.  On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would require
insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The FDIC Board voted to adopt a uniform three-basis point increase in assessment rates effective on
January 1, 2011, and extend the restoration period from seven to eight years. This rule was finalized on November 2, 2009. As a result, the Company is carrying a prepaid asset of $4.3 million as

  11 


Table of Contents

of December 31, 2011. The Companys quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments will be paid from this amount until the amount is exhausted or until December 30, 2014, when
any amount remaining would be returned to the Company.  On September 30, 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue
issued a draft directive prohibiting a corporation from pledging more than 50 percent of security corporation stock it owns to secure a borrowing, effective for tax years beginning on or after October 2012. Century Bank currently utilizes the stock
of two of its security corporations to secure Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB) advances. Should this draft directive become effective, Century Bank would have fewer assets available to secure FHLBB advances, or would have a
higher tax rate if it chose to utilize security corporations to a lesser extent.  OVERVIEW 
Century Bancorp, Inc. (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the Company) is a
Massachusetts state-chartered bank holding company headquartered in Medford, Massachusetts. The Company is a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1972 and has one banking subsidiary (the Bank): Century Bank and Trust Company formed in
1969. At December 31, 2011, the Company had total assets of $2.7 billion. Currently, the Company operates 24 banking offices in 17 cities and towns in Massachusetts, ranging from Braintree in the south to Beverly in the north. The Banks
customers consist primarily of small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in these communities and surrounding areas, as well as local governments and institutions throughout Massachusetts. 
The Companys results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned
on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The results of operations are also affected by the level of income/fees from loans and deposits, as well as operating expenses, the provision for loan losses, the impact of
federal and state income taxes and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity.  The Company offers a wide
range of services to commercial enterprises, state and local governments and agencies, nonprofit organizations and individuals. It emphasizes service to small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in its market area. The Company makes
commercial loans, real estate and construction loans, and consumer loans and accepts savings, time and demand deposits. In addition, the Company offers to its corporate and institutional customers automated lockbox collection services, cash
management services and account reconciliation services, and it actively promotes the marketing of these services to the municipal market. Also, the Company provides full-service securities brokerage services through a program called Investment
Services at Century Bank, which is supported by LPL Financial, a full-service securities brokerage business.  The Company is
also a provider of financial services, including cash management, transaction processing and short-term financing, to municipalities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Company has deposit relationships with 188 (54%) of the 351 cities and
towns in Massachusetts.  The Company had net income of $16,693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with net
income of $13,574,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, and net income of $10,160,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $3.01 in 2011, compared to $2.45 in 2010 and $1.84 in 2009. 
The trends in the net interest margin are illustrated in the graph below: 
Net Interest Margin   



  12 


Table of Contents
The primary factor accounting for the general increase in the net interest margin for 2009
was pricing discipline. The primary factor accounting for the general decrease in the net interest margin for 2010 was a large influx of deposits, primarily from municipalities, and a corresponding increase in short-term investments. The net
interest margin fell somewhat during the second quarter of 2011 mainly as a result of increased deposits and corresponding lower-yield short-term investments. During the third quarter, management stabilized the net interest margin by continuing to
lower cost of funds and by deploying excess liquidity through expansion of the investment portfolio.  While management will
continue its efforts to improve the net interest margin, there can be no assurance that certain factors beyond its control, such as the prepayment of loans and changes in market interest rates, will continue to positively impact the net interest
margin.  Historical U.S. Treasury Yield Curve 
  

 A yield curve is a line that typically plots the interest rates of U.S. Treasury Debt, which have
different maturity dates but the same credit quality, at a specific point in time. The three main types of yield curve shapes are normal, inverted and flat. Over the past three years, the U.S. economy has experienced low short-term rates. Since
December 31, 2009, longer-term rates have declined resulting in a flatter yield curve.  During 2011, the Companys
earnings were positively impacted primarily by an increase in net interest income. This increase was primarily due to an increase in earning assets. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a lower short-term rate environment. The
lower short-term rates negatively impacted the net interest margin for 2011, 2010 and 2009 as the rate at which short-term deposits could be invested declined more than the rates offered on those deposits. 
Total assets were $2,743,225,000 at December 31, 2011, an increase of 12.3% from total assets of $2,441,684,000 on December 31,
2010.  On December 31, 2011, stockholders equity totaled $160,649,000, compared with $145,025,000 on

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact income, are considered
critical accounting policies.  The Company considers impairment of investment securities and allowance for loan losses to be
its critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in the accounting policies that require material estimates and assumptions.  Impaired Investment Securities  If a decline in fair value below the
amortized cost basis of an investment security is judged to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of the writedown is included as a charge to earnings. The amount of the
impairment charge is recognized in earnings with an offset for the noncredit component which is recognized through other comprehensive income. Some factors considered for other-than-temporary impairment related to a debt security include an analysis
of yield which results in a decrease in expected cash flows, whether an unrealized loss is issuer specific, whether the issuer has defaulted on scheduled interest and principal payments, whether the issuers current financial condition hinders
its ability to make future scheduled interest and principal payments on a timely basis or whether there was a downgrade in ratings by rating agencies.  The Company does not intend to sell any of its debt securities with an unrealized loss, and it is not likely that it will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of their
remaining amortized cost, which may be maturity.  Allowance for Loan Losses 
Arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management maintains an
allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Managements methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the
allowance consists of several key elements, which include the formula allowance and specific allowances for identified problem loans.  The formula allowance evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment. Specific allowances for loan losses entail the assignment of allowance amounts to
individual loans on the basis of loan impairment. The formula allowance and specific allowances also include managements evaluation of various conditions, including business and economic conditions, delinquency trends, charge-off experience
and other quality factors. Further information regarding the Companys methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is contained within Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as part of the examination
process, periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
Investment Securities 
The Companys securities portfolio consists of securities available-for-sale (AFS) and securities held-to-maturity
(HTM). 
  14 


Table of Contents
Securities available-for-sale consist of certain U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Sponsored
Enterprise mortgage-backed securities; state, county and municipal securities; privately issued mortgage-backed securities; foreign debt securities; and other marketable equities. 
These securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are recognized as a separate
component of stockholders equity. The fair value of securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2011 totaled $1,258,676,000 and included gross unrealized gains of $16,842,000 and gross unrealized losses of $3,138,000. A year earlier,
securities available-for-sale were $909,391,000 including gross unrealized gains of $12,450,000 and gross unrealized losses of $6,615,000. In 2011, the Company recognized gains of $1,940,000 on the sale of available-for-sale securities. In 2010 and
2009, the Company recognized gains of $1,851,000 and $2,734,000, respectively.  Securities which management intends to hold
until maturity consist of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and mortgage-backed securities. Securities held-to-maturity as of December 31, 2011 are carried at their amortized cost of $179,368,000 and exclude gross unrealized gains of
$5,471,000 and gross unrealized losses of $17,000. A year earlier, securities held-to-maturity totaled $230,116,000, excluding gross unrealized gains of $5,394,000 and gross unrealized losses of $1,986,000. 
The following table sets forth the fair value and percentage distribution of securities available-for-sale at the dates indicated.

 Included in Obligations Issued by States and Political Subdivisions as of December 31, 2011, is
$3,724,000 of an auction rate municipal obligation (ARS) with an unrealized loss of $957,000. This debt security was issued by a governmental entity but is not a debt obligation of the issuing entity. This ARS is the obligation of a
large nonprofit entity. This obligation is a variable rate security with long-term maturity whose interest rate is set periodically through an auction process for ARS. As the auctions have not attracted sufficient bidders, the interest rate adjusts
to the default rate defined in the obligations underlying documents. Although many of these issuers have bond insurance, the Company purchased the security based on the creditworthiness of the underlying obligor. 
  15 


Table of Contents
In the case of a failed auction, the Company may not have access to funds as only a limited
market exists for the failed ARS. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys ARS was purchased subsequent to its failure with a fair value of $3,724,000 and an amortized cost of $4,681,000. 
As of December 31, 2011, the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on this security was 0.31%. 
The majority of the Companys securities AFS are classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The fair values of these securities are obtained from a pricing service, which provides the Company with a description of the inputs generally utilized for each type of security. These inputs include benchmark yields,
reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. Managements understanding of a pricing services pricing methodologies includes obtaining an understanding
the valuation risks, assessing its qualification, verification of sources of information and processes used to develop prices and identifying, documenting, and testing controls. Managements validation of a vendors pricing methodology
include establishing internal controls to determine that the pricing information received by a pricing service and used by management in the valuation process is relevant and reliable. Market indicators and industry and economic events are also
monitored. The decline in fair value from amortized cost for individual available-for-sale securities that are temporarily impaired is not attributable to changes in credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell any of its debt
securities and it is not likely that it will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
December 31, 2011.  Securities available-for-sale totaling $18,914,000, or 0.69% of assets, are classified as Level 3, as
defined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These securities are generally equity investments or municipal securities with no readily determinable fair value. The securities are carried at fair value with
periodic review of underlying financial statements and credit ratings to assess the appropriateness of these valuations.  Debt
securities of Government Sponsored Enterprises refer primarily to debt securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Control of these enterprises was directly taken over by the U.S. Government in the third quarter of 2008. 
The following table sets forth the amortized cost and percentage distribution of securities held-to-maturity at the dates indicated.

 At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bank had no investments in obligations of individual states,
counties, municipalities or nongovernment corporate entities which exceeded 10% of stockholders equity. In 2011, sales of securities totaling $75,615,000 in gross proceeds resulted in a net realized gain of $1,940,000. There were no sales of
state, county or municipal securities during 2011 and 2010. In 2010, sales of securities totaling $41,251,000 in gross proceeds resulted in net realized gains of $1,851,000. In 2009, sales of securities totaling $94,142,000 in gross proceeds
resulted in net realized gains of $2,734.000.  Management reviews the investment portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment
of individual securities on a regular basis. The results of such analysis are dependent upon general market conditions and specific conditions related to the issuers of our securities.  Loans  The Companys lending activities are conducted principally in
Massachusetts. The Company grants single and multi-family residential loans, commercial and commercial real estate loans, and a variety of consumer loans. To a lesser extent, the Company grants loans for the construction of residential homes,
multi-family properties, commercial real estate properties and land development. Most loans granted by the Company are secured by real estate collateral. The ability and willingness of commercial real estate, commercial, construction, residential
and consumer loan borrowers to honor their repayment commitments are generally dependent on the health of the real estate market in the borrowers geographic areas and of the general economy. 
The following summary shows the composition of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated.

 The Companys commercial and industrial (C&I) loan customers represent various small
and middle-market established businesses involved in manufacturing, distribution, retailing and services. Most clients are privately owned with markets that range from local to national in scope. Many of the loans to this segment are secured by
liens on corporate assets and the personal guarantees of the principals. The regional economic strength or weakness impacts the relative risks in this loan category. There is little concentration in any one business sector, and loan risks are
generally diversified among many borrowers.  Commercial real estate loans are extended to finance various manufacturing,
warehouse, light industrial, office, retail and residential properties in the Banks market area, which generally includes Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. Also included are loans to educational institutions, hospitals and
other non-profit organizations. Loans are normally extended in amounts up to a maximum of 80% of appraised value and normally for terms between three and ten years. Amortization schedules are long term and thus a balloon payment is generally due at
maturity. Under most circumstances, the Bank will offer to rewrite or otherwise extend the loan at prevailing interest rates. During recent years, the Bank has emphasized nonresidential-type owner-occupied properties. This complements our C&I
emphasis placed on the operating business entities and will continue. The regional economic environment affects the risk of both nonresidential and residential mortgages.  Residential real estate (14 family) includes two categories of loans. Included in residential real estate are approximately $12,269,000 of C&I type loans secured by 14 family real estate.
Primarily, these are small businesses with modest capital or shorter operating histories where the collateral mitigates some risk. This category of loans shares similar risk characteristics with the C&I loans, notwithstanding the collateral
position.

The other category of residential real estate loans is mostly 14 family residential
properties located in the Banks market area. General underwriting criteria are largely the same as those used by Fannie Mae. The Bank utilizes mortgage insurance to provide lower down payment products and has provided a First Time
Homebuyer product to encourage new home ownership. Residential real estate loan volume has increased and remains a core consumer product. The economic environment impacts the risks associated with this category. 
Home equity loans are extended as both first and second mortgages on owner-occupied residential properties in the Banks market area.
Loans are underwritten to a maximum loan to property value of 75%.  Bank officers evaluate the feasibility of construction
projects based on independent appraisals of the project, architects or engineers evaluations of the cost of construction and other relevant data. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was obligated to advance a total of $16,819,000
to complete projects under construction.  The composition of nonperforming assets is as follows:

 At December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, impaired loans had specific reserves of $741,000,
$317,000, $745,000, $600,000 and $75,000 respectively.  The Company was servicing mortgage loans sold to others without
recourse of approximately $18,220,000, $983,000, $1,127,000, $768,000 and $559,000 at December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, the Company services mortgage loans sold to others with limited recourse. The
outstanding balance of these loans with limited recourse was approximately $24,000, $36,000, $47,000, $56,000 and $65,000 at December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company had $3,389,000 of loans held for sale at
December 31, 2011.  Servicing assets are recorded at fair value and recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired
through sale of loans with servicing rights retained. Mortgage servicing assets are amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. Upon sale, the mortgage servicing asset
(MSA) is established, which represents the then-current estimated fair value based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present
value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model 
  20 


Table of Contents

incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income,
prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing rights are recorded in other assets and are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of estimated net servicing income and are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each
reporting date. MSAs are reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. MSAs totaled $123,000 at December 31, 2011 and $0 for December 31, 2007, through December 31, 2010. 
Directors and officers of the Company and their associates are customers of, and have other transactions with, the Company in the normal
course of business. All loans and commitments included in such transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not
involve more than normal risk of collection or present other unfavorable features.  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when
any payment of principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the collateral is sufficient to cover both principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. The Company monitors closely the performance of its loan
portfolio. In addition to internal loan review, the Company has contracted with an independent organization to review the Companys commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. This independent review was performed in each of the past
five years. The status of delinquent loans, as well as situations identified as potential problems, is reviewed on a regular basis by senior management and monthly by the Board of Directors of the Bank. 
Nonaccrual loans decreased during 2011, primarily as a result of $1,200,000 in charge-offs from two construction loans as well as the
subsequent foreclosure of $1,300,000 of one of the construction loans.  Nonaccrual loans decreased during 2010, primarily as a
result of resolution of a $2,479,000 commercial real estate loan as well as $900,000 in charge-offs from two construction loans during 2010. Nonaccrual loans increased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of three loan relationships, one
primarily commercial real estate and two construction totaling $7,379,000. Nonaccrual loans increased from 2007 to 2008, primarily as a result of eight consumer mortgages totaling $1,649,000. 
The Company continues to monitor closely $20,906,000 and $32,905,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of loans for which
management has concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to perform. The majority of the loans are secured by real estate and are considered to have adequate collateral value to cover the loan balances at December 31, 2011, although such
values may fluctuate with changes in the economy and the real estate market.  Allowance for Loan Losses 
The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount determined by management on the basis of the character of the loans, loan
performance, the financial condition of borrowers, the value of collateral

 The amount of the allowance for loan losses results from managements evaluation of the quality of
the loan portfolio considering such factors as loan status, specific reserves on impaired loans, collateral values, financial condition of the borrower, the state of the economy and other relevant information. The pace of the charge-offs depends on
many factors, including the national and regional economy. Cyclical lagging factors may result in charge-offs being higher than historical levels. Charge-offs increased during 2007 through 2009 due to an increase in commercial loan charge-offs and
construction loan charge-offs for 2009 as a result of the weakening of the overall economy and real estate market. Charge-offs declined in 2010 and 2011 as a result of the overall decrease in the level of nonaccrual loans. The dollar amount of the
allowance for loan losses and the level of the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased primarily as a result of an increase in the historical loss factor on construction loans, increases in specific reserves associated with impaired loans
as well as an increase in commercial real estate loans.

In evaluating the allowance for loan losses, the Company considered the following categories
to be higher risk:  Construction loans  The outstanding loan balance of construction loans at
December 31, 2011 is $56,819,000. A major factor in nonaccrual loans is one construction loan. Based on this fact, and the general local construction conditions, the management closely monitors all construction loans and considers this type of
loan to be higher risk.  Higher-balance loans  Loans greater than $1.0 million are considered
high-balance loans. The balance of these loans is $489,114,000 at December 31, 2011, as compared to $434,829,000 at December 31, 2010. These loans are considered higher risk due to the concentration in individual loans.
Additional allowance allocations are made based upon the level of high-balance loans. Included in high-balance loans are loans greater than $10.0 million. The balance of these loans is $189,222,000 at December 31, 2011, as compared to
$124,685,000 at December 31, 2010. Additional allowance allocations are made based upon the level of this type of high balance loans that is separate and greater than the $1.0 million allocation. 
Small business loans  The outstanding loan balances of small business loans is $44,020,000 at
December 31, 2011. These are considered higher risk loans because small businesses have been negatively impacted by the current economic conditions. In a liquidation scenario, the collateral, if any, is often not sufficient to fully recover the
outstanding balance of the loan. As a result, the Company often seeks additional collateral prior to renewing maturing small business loans. In addition, the payment status of the loans is monitored closely in order to initiate collection efforts in
a timely fashion.  The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed for an adequate reserve to absorb losses
in the existing loan portfolio. This amount is determined by an evaluation of the loan portfolio, including input from an independent organization engaged to review selected larger loans, a review of loan experience and current economic conditions.
Although the allowance is allocated between categories, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses attributable to all loan categories. At December 31 of each year listed below, the allowance is comprised of the following:

 Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. In addition, various regulatory
agencies, as part of the examination process, periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to
them at the time of their examination. Further information regarding the allocation of the allowance is contained within Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Borrowings  The Banks borrowings consisted primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB) borrowings collateralized by a blanket pledge agreement on the Banks FHLBB stock, certain
qualified investment securities, deposits at the FHLBB and residential mortgages held in the Banks portfolios. The Banks borrowings from the FHLBB totaled $244,000,000, an increase of $23,000,000 from the prior year. The Banks
remaining term borrowing capacity at the FHLBB at December 31, 2011, was approximately $197,505,000. In addition, the Bank has a $14,500,000 line of credit with the FHLBB. See Note 12, Other Borrowed Funds and Subordinated
Debentures, for a schedule, their interest rates and other information.  Subordinated Debentures 
In May 1998, the Company consummated the sale of a Trust Preferred Securities offering, in which it issued $29,639,000 of subordinated
debt securities due 2029 to its newly formed unconsolidated subsidiary, Century Bancorp Capital Trust. 
  24 


Table of Contents
Century Bancorp Capital Trust then issued 2,875,000 shares of Cumulative Trust Preferred
Securities with a liquidation value of $10 per share. These securities pay dividends at an annualized rate of 8.30%. The Company redeemed through its subsidiary, Century Bancorp Capital Trust, its 8.30% Trust Preferred Securities on January 10,
2005.  In December 2004, the Company consummated the sale of a Trust Preferred Securities offering, in which it issued
$36,083,000 of subordinated debt securities due 2034 to its newly formed unconsolidated subsidiary, Century Bancorp Capital Trust II.  Century Bancorp Capital Trust II then issued 35,000 shares of Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share. These securities pay dividends at an annualized rate of
6.65% for the first ten years and then convert to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.87% for the remaining 20 years. The Company is using the proceeds primarily for general business purposes.  Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase  The Banks remaining
borrowings consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $143,320,000, an increase of $34,770,000 from the prior year. See Note 11, Securities Sold Under Agreements
to Repurchase, for a schedule, including their interest rates and other information.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Net Interest Income  The
Companys operating results depend primarily on net interest income and fees received for providing services. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased 9.1% in 2011 to $62,081,000, compared with $56,893,000 in 2010. The
increase in net interest income for 2011 was mainly due to a 10.7% increase in the average balances of earning assets, combined with a similar increase in deposits. The increased volume was partially offset by a decrease of four basis points in the
net interest margin. The level of interest rates, the ability of the Companys earning assets and liabilities to adjust to changes in interest rates and the mix of the Companys earning assets and liabilities affect net interest income.
The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to 2.48% in 2011 from 2.52% in 2010 and decreased from 2.69% in 2009.  Additional information about the decreased net interest margin is contained in the Overview section of this report. Also, there can be no assurance that certain factors beyond its control,
such as the prepayment of loans and changes in market interest rates, will continue to positively impact the net interest margin. Management believes that the current yield curve environment will continue to present challenges as deposit and
borrowing costs may have the potential to increase at a faster rate than corresponding asset categories.

Table of Contents
The following table summarizes the year-to-year changes in the Companys net interest
income resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and volume changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes due to rate are computed by multiplying the change in rate by the prior years volume. Changes due to volume are
computed by multiplying the change in volume by the prior years rate. Changes in volume and rate that cannot be separately identified have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of each change.

 Average earning assets were $2,503,054,000 in 2011, an increase of $242,426,000 or 10.7% from the average
in 2010, which was 18.8% higher than the average in 2009. Total average securities, including securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, were $1,277,758,000, an increase of 26.4% from the average in 2010. The increase in
securities volume was mainly attributable to an increase in taxable securities. An increase in securities balances offset, somewhat, by lower securities returns resulted in higher securities income, which increased 8.4% to $28,965,000 on a fully tax
equivalent basis. Total average loans increased 8.1% to $948,883,000 after increasing $24,436,000 in 2010. The primary reason for the increase in loans was due in large 
  27

part to an increase in tax-exempt commercial real estate lending as well as residential first mortgage lending. The increase in loan volume offset, somewhat, by a decrease in loan rates resulted
in higher loan income, which increased by 2.6% or $1,412,000 to $54,768,000. Total loan income was $51,174,000 in 2009.  The
Companys sources of funds include deposits and borrowed funds. On average, deposits increased 12.4%, or $234,379,000, in 2011 after increasing by 21.7%, or $338,101,000, in 2010. Deposits increased in 2011, primarily as a result of increases
in demand deposits, money market, NOW and time deposit accounts. Deposits increased in 2010, primarily as a result of increases in demand deposits, savings, money market, NOW and time deposit accounts. Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures
decreased by 0.9% in 2011, following an increase of 5.0% in 2010. The majority of the Companys borrowed funds are borrowings from the FHLBB and retail repurchase agreements. Average borrowings from the FHLBB increased by approximately
$936,000, and average retail repurchase agreements decreased by $3,943,000 in 2011. Interest expense totaled $22,766,000 in 2011, a decrease of $2,051,000, or 8.26%, from 2010 when interest expense decreased 21.8% from 2009. The decrease in interest
expense is primarily due to market decreases in deposit rates and continued deposit pricing discipline.  Provision for Loan Losses
 The provision for loan losses was $4,550,000 in 2011, compared with $5,575,000 in 2010 and $6,625,000 in 2009. These
provisions are the result of managements evaluation of the amounts and quality of the loan portfolio considering such factors as loan status, collateral values, financial condition of the borrower, the state of the economy and other relevant
information. The provision for loan losses decreased during 2011 and 2010, primarily as a result of decreased provisions related to nonaccrual loans as well as managements quantitative analysis of the loan portfolio. 
The allowance for loan losses was $16,574,000 at December 31, 2011, compared with $14,053,000 at December 31, 2010. Expressed as
a percentage of outstanding loans at year-end, the allowance was 1.68% in 2011 and 1.55% in 2010. This ratio increased primarily as a result of decreased levels of charge-offs, an increase in the historical loss factor on construction loans, and an
increase in required specific reserves associated with impaired loans.  Nonperforming loans, which include all nonaccruing
loans, totaled $5,827,000 on December 31, 2011, compared with $8,068,000 on December 31, 2010. Nonperforming loans decreased primarily as a result of $1,200,000 in charge-offs from two construction loans as well as the subsequent
foreclosure of $1,300,000 of one of the construction loans.  Other Operating Income 
During 2011, the Company continued to experience positive results in its fee-based services, including fees derived from traditional
banking activities such as deposit-related services, its automated lockbox collection system and full-service securities brokerage supported by LPL Financial, a full-service securities brokerage business. 
Under the lockbox program, which is not tied to extensions of credit by the Company, the Companys customers arrange for payments of
their accounts receivable to be made directly to the Company. The Company records the amounts paid to its customers, deposits the funds to the customers account and provides automated records of the transactions to customers. Typical customers
for the lockbox service are municipalities that use it to automate tax collections, cable TV companies and other commercial enterprises.  Through a program called Investment Services at Century Bank, the Bank provides full-service securities brokerage services supported by LPL Financial, a full-service securities brokerage business.
Registered representatives employed by Century Bank offer limited investment advice, execute transactions and assist customers in financial and retirement planning. LPL Financial provides research to the Banks representatives. The Bank
receives a share in the commission revenues.

Total other operating income in 2011 was $16,240,000, an increase of $241,000, or 1.5%,
compared to 2010. This increase followed a decrease of $471,000 or 2.9% in 2010, compared to 2009. Included in other operating income are net gains on sales of securities of $1,940,000, $1,851,000 and $2,734,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Service charge income, which continues to be a major area of other operating income, totaling $7,885,000 in 2011, increased $9,000 compared to 2010. This followed a decrease of $127,000 compared to 2009. Service charges on deposit accounts increased
during 2011, mainly because of increases in fees collected. The increase in fees collected was mainly attributable to an increase in overdraft fees and debit card fees, which was offset, somewhat, by a decrease in fees collected from processing
activities. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased during 2010 mainly because of decreases in fees collected. The decrease in fees collected was mainly attributable to a reduction in processing activity as well as a decrease in money service
business activity. Lockbox revenues totaled $2,770,000, down $141,000 in 2011 following an increase of $97,000 in 2010. Other income totaled $3,204,000, up $73,000 in 2011 following an increase of $352,000 in 2010. The increase in 2011 was mainly
attributable to net gains on sales of loans of $660,000. This was offset, somewhat, by a decrease of $514,000 in the growth of cash surrender values on life insurance policies, which was attributable to lower returns on life insurance policies. The
increase in 2010 was mainly attributable to an increase of $378,000 in the growth of cash surrender values on life insurance policies, which was attributable to additional earnings as a result of certain policies reaching their 20-year anniversary
during the first quarter of 2010.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses were $48,742,000 in 2011, compared to $47,372,000 in 2010 and $46,379,000 in 2009.  Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased by $1,232,000 or 4.3% in 2011, after increasing by 5.5% in 2010. The increase in 2011 was mainly attributable to increases in staff levels, merit
increases in salaries and increases in health insurance costs. The increase in 2010 was mainly attributable to $916,000 due to Jonathan G. Sloane, former Co-CEO, in accordance with his separation agreement as previously announced as well as an
increase in staff levels and merit increases in salaries and increases in health insurance costs.  Occupancy expense increased
by $374,000, or 9.3%, in 2011, following a decrease of $67,000, or 1.6%, in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in rent expense, depreciation expense and building maintenance costs associated with branch expansion.
The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributable to a decrease in utility and building maintenance costs offset somewhat by an increase in rent expense and real estate taxes.  Equipment expense increased by $103,000, or 4.8%, in 2011, following a decrease of $240,000, or 10.1%, in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in service contracts and
depreciation expense. The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation expense. Other operating expenses increased by $601,000 in 2011, which followed a $192,000 increase in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily
attributable to an increase in customer expenses, other real estate owned expense and contributions offset somewhat by decreases in marketing expense. The increase in 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing expense and software
maintenance offset somewhat by decreases in legal expense.  FDIC assessments decreased by $940,000, or 31.7%, in 2011,
following a decrease of $371,000, or 11.1%, in 2010. FDIC assessments decreased in 2011 mainly as a result of a decrease in the assessment rate. FDIC assessments decreased in 2010 mainly as a result of a special assessment $1,000,000 during 2009,
offset somewhat by an increase in the deposit base. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC announced a special assessment on insured institutions as part of its efforts to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund and help maintain public confidence in the banking
system. The special assessment was five basis points of each FDIC-insured depository institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital, as of June 30, 2009. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $1,000,000 in the second quarter of
2009 in connection with the special assessment.

Provision for Income Taxes  Income tax expense was $1,554,000 in 2011, $1,244,000 in 2010 and $1,183,000 in 2009. The effective tax rate was 8.5% in 2011, 8.4% in 2010 and 10.4% in 2009. The decreases in the effective tax rate for
2011 and 2010 were mainly attributable to an increase in tax-exempt interest income and tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. The federal tax rate was 34% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
On July 3, 2008, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted a law that included reducing the tax rates on net income applicable to
financial institutions. The rate drops from 10.5% to 10% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, to 9.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, and to 9% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2012,
and thereafter.  Market Risk and Asset Liability Management  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit-taking
activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  The Companys
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the Companys earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at
the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools. One measure of the Companys exposure to differential changes in interest
rates between assets and liabilities is an interest rate risk management test.  This test measures the impact on net interest
income of an immediate change in interest rates in 100-basis point increments as set forth in the following table:

The percentage change in this column represents net interest income for 12 months in various rate scenarios versus the net interest income in a stable interest rate
environment.  The Companys primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse
impact of changes in interest rates on the Companys net interest income and capital, while structuring the Companys asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its
asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Liquidity is provided by maintaining an adequate level of liquid assets that include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other
temporary investments. Liquid assets totaled $226,117,000 on December 31, 2011, compared with $302,470,000 on December 31, 2010. In each of these two years, deposit and borrowing activity has generally been adequate to support asset
activity.  The sources of funds for dividends paid by the Company are dividends received from the Bank and liquid funds held by
the Company. The Company and the Bank are regulated enterprises and their abilities to pay dividends are subject to regulatory review and restriction. Certain regulatory and statutory restrictions exist regarding dividends, loans and advances from
the Bank to the Company. Generally, the Bank has the ability to pay dividends to the Company subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements.

Capital Adequacy  Total stockholders equity was $160,649,000 at December 31, 2011, compared with $145,025,000 at December 31, 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily the result of earnings and a decrease
in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, offset by dividends paid. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was mainly attributable to an increase of $4,726,000 in the net unrealized gains on the Companys
available-for-sale portfolio, net of taxes, offset by an increase of $3,667,000 in the additional pension liability, net of taxes  Federal banking regulators have issued risk-based capital guidelines, which assign risk factors to asset categories and off-balance-sheet items. The current guidelines require a Tier 1 capital-to-risk
assets ratio of at least 4.00% and a total capital-to-risk assets ratio of at least 8.00%. The Company and the Bank exceeded these requirements with a Tier 1 capital-to-risk assets ratio of 14.73% and 12.84%, respectively, and total capital-to-risk
assets ratio of 15.98% and 14.09%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Additionally, federal banking regulators have issued leverage ratio guidelines, which supplement the risk-based capital guidelines. The minimum leverage ratio requirement
applicable to the Company is 4.00%; and at December 31, 2011, the Company and the Bank exceeded this requirement with leverage ratios of 7.12% and 6.20%, respectively.  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies  The Company has
entered into contractual obligations and commitments. The following tables summarize the Companys contractual cash obligations and other commitments at December 31, 2011.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments by Maturity (dollars in thousands)

 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk 
The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of
its customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to originate and sell loans, standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these particular classes of
financial instruments.  The Companys exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
financial instrument for loan commitments, standby letters of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in

 Commitments to originate loans, unadvanced portions of construction loans and unused letters of credit are
generally agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of
the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on managements credit evaluation of the borrower.  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The fair value of standby letters of credit was $39,000 and $68,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Recent Accounting Developments  In July 2010, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. This Update
requires an entity to provide disclosures that facilitate financial statement users evaluation of (1) the nature of credit risk inherent in the entitys loan portfolio (2) how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at
the allowance for loan and lease losses and (3) the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period were effective for interim and annual reporting periods
ending on or after December 15, 2010. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company has provided the
required disclosures in Note 6.  In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805),
Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations to address diversity in practice in interpreting the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations. This ASU specifies that if a
public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current year business combination(s) had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual
reporting period. This update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this
update did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  In April 2011, the
FASB issued ASU 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310), A Creditors Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring. This Update provides additional guidance and clarification to help creditors in determining whether
a creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties for purposes of determining whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). This Update is effective for the first
interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011, with retrospective application to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. The measurement of impairment should be done prospectively in the period of adoption for loans that
are newly identified as TDRs upon adoption of this Update. In addition, the TDR disclosures required by ASU 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses are
required beginning in the period of adoption of this Update. The Company adopted this Update in the second quarter of 2011. The Company has provided the disclosures required in Note 6.

Table of Contents
In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860),
Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. This update revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or
redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset.
This update removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee,
and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. The amendments in this update will be effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The amendments will be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date and early adoption is permitted. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The guidance
clarifies and expands the disclosures pertaining to unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, including the disclosure of quantitative information related to (1) the valuation processes used, (2) the sensitivity of the
fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs, and (3) use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the assets highest and best use. The guidance also
requires, for public entities, disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is disclosed. The amendments in this
Update are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220),
Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU amends the disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) as part of
the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. Under the amended guidance, all changes in OCI are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial
statements. The changes are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, ending after December 15, 2011, with retrospective application required. Early application is permitted. There will be no impact on the
Companys consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation. In December 2011, the FASB elected to defer the effective date of those changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate only to the
presentation of reclassification adjustments in the statement of income by issuing ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.  In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU
2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This ASU is intended to reduce the complexity and cost of performing an evaluation of impairment of goodwill. Under the new guidance, an
entity will have the option of first assessing qualitative factors (events and circumstances) to determine whether it is more likely than not (meaning a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test
will be unnecessary. The amendments will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU
2011-08 as of January 1, 2012.  In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits  Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic 715-80), Disclosures about an Employers Participation in a Multiemployer Plan. This ASU requires new and expanded disclosures for individually material multiemployer pension plans.
The changes are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. Early application is permitted. There will be no impact to the consolidated financial results as the Company does not participate in any multiemployer retirement plans.

CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Century Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Century Bank and Trust Company (the Bank). The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of the Banks wholly owned subsidiaries, Century Subsidiary Investments, Inc. (CSII), Century
Subsidiary Investments, Inc. II (CSII II), Century Subsidiary Investments, Inc. III (CSII III) and Century Financial Services Inc. (CFSI). CSII, CSII II, and CSII III are engaged in buying, selling and holding
investment securities. CFSI has the power to engage in financial agency, securities brokerage, and investment and financial advisory services and related securities credit. The Company also owns 100% of Century Bancorp Capital Trust II (CBCT
II). The entity is an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company provides a full range of banking services to individual, business and municipal customers in Massachusetts. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the
Federal Reserve Board. The Bank, a state chartered financial institution, is subject to supervision and regulation by applicable state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
FDIC) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions
on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations
also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to
influence the economy. All aspects of the Companys business are highly competitive. The Company faces aggressive competition from other lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The Company has one
reportable operating segment.  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and general practices within the banking industry. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Material estimates that are susceptible to change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan losses. Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses is adequate based on independent appraisals and review of other factors, including historical charge-off rates with additional allocations based on risk factors for each category and general economic factors. While
management uses available information to recognize loan losses, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies periodically review the Companys
allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
Certain reclassifications are made to prior-year amounts whenever necessary to conform with the current-year presentation. 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  In determining fair values a hierarchal disclosure framework is used associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The three broad levels
defined by the FASB ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:  Level I  Quoted prices are available in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I are highly liquid cash instruments with 
  38 


Table of Contents
CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 

quoted prices, such as G-7 government, agency securities, listed equities and money market securities, as well as listed derivative instruments. 
Level II  Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments includes cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments whose fair value has been derived using a model where
inputs to the model are directly observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly
observed. Instruments that are generally included in this category are corporate bonds and loans, mortgage whole loans, municipal bonds and over the counter (OTC) derivatives. 
Level III  Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial
instruments do not have two-way markets and are measured using managements best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Instruments that are included
in this category generally include certain commercial mortgage loans, certain private equity investments, distressed debt, and noninvestment grade residual interests in securitizations as well as certain highly structured OTC derivative contracts.
 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include highly liquid assets with an original maturity of three months or less. Highly liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds
sold and certificates of deposit.  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS 
As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, short-term investments include highly liquid certificates of deposit with original maturities of
more than 90 days but less than one year.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported
at amortized cost; debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling are classified as trading and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; and debt and equity securities
not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of
estimated related income taxes. The Company has no securities held for trading.  Premiums and discounts on investment
securities are amortized or accreted into income by use of the level-yield method. If a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to
fair value. The total amount of the impairment charge is recognized in earnings, with an offset for the noncredit component, which is recognized as other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are recognized on
the trade date on a specific identification basis.  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK 
The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB) system, is required to maintain an investment in capital
stock of the FHLBB. Based on redemption provisions, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, the FHLBB may declare dividends on the stock. The 
  39

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 

Company reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the FHLBB reported preliminary net income of $159.6
million. The FHLBB also declared a dividend equal to an annual yield of 0.49%. As of December 31, 2011, no impairment has been recognized.  LOANS HELD FOR SALE  Loans originated and intended for sale in the
secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. 
LOANS  Interest on loans is recognized based on the daily principal amount outstanding. Accrual of interest is discontinued when loans become 90 days delinquent unless the collateral is sufficient to cover
both principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. Past-due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. Loans, including impaired loans, on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued, are designated nonaccrual
loans. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, all income that has been accrued but remains unpaid is reversed against current period income, and all amortization of deferred loan costs and fees is discontinued. Nonaccrual loans may be returned to an
accrual status when principal and interest payments are not delinquent or the risk characteristics of the loan have improved to the extent that there no longer exists a concern as to the collectibility of principal and interest. Income received on
nonaccrual loans is either recorded in income or applied to the principal balance of the loan, depending on managements evaluation as to the collectibility of principal.  Loan origination fees and related direct loan origination costs are offset, and the resulting net amount is deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans using the level-yield method.
Prepayments are not initially considered when amortizing premiums and discounts.  The Bank measures impairment for impaired
loans at either the fair value of the loan, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. This method applies to all
loans, uncollateralized as well as collateralized, except large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans such as residential real estate and consumer loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and loans that are measured at fair value.
Management considers the payment status, net worth and earnings potential of the borrower, and the value and cash flow of the collateral as factors to determine if a loan will be paid in accordance with its contractual terms. Management does
not set any minimum delay of payments as a factor in reviewing for impaired classification. Loans are charged-off when management believes that the collectibility of the loans principal is not probable. In addition, criteria for classification
of a loan as in-substance foreclosure has been modified so that such classification need be made only when a lender is in possession of the collateral. The Bank measures the impairment of troubled debt restructurings using the pre-modification rate
of interest.  TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Transfers of financial assets, typically residential mortgages and loan participations for the Company, are accounted for as sales when
control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it
from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.

In accordance with FASB ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly Statement of
Position (SOP) No. 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer) the Company reviews acquired loans for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected
from the Companys initial investment in the acquired loans to determine if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. If those differences are attributable to credit quality, the loans contractually required
payments received in excess of the amount of its cash flows expected at acquisition, or nonaccretable discount, is not accreted into income. FASB ASC 310-30 requires that the Company recognize the excess of all cash flows expected at acquisition
over the Companys initial investment in the loan as interest income using the interest method over the term of the loan. This excess is referred to as accretable discount and is recorded as a reduction of the loan balance. 
Loans which, at acquisition, do not have evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination are outside the scope of FASB ASC
310-30. For such loans, the discount, if any, representing the excess of the amount of reasonably estimable and probable discounted future cash collections over the purchase price, is accreted into interest income using the interest method over the
term of the loan. Prepayments are not considered in the calculation of accretion income. Additionally, discount is not accreted on nonperforming loans.  When a loan is paid off, the excess of any cash received over the net investment is recorded as interest income. In addition to the amount of purchase discount that is recognized at that time, income may
include interest owed by the borrower prior to the Companys acquisition of the loan, interest collected if on nonperforming status, prepayment fees and other loan fees.  NONPERFORMING ASSETS  In addition to nonperforming loans,
nonperforming assets include other real estate owned. Other real estate owned is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Other real estate owned is recorded initially at estimated fair
value less costs to sell. When such assets are acquired, the excess of the loan balance over the estimated fair value of the asset is charged to the allowance for loan losses. An allowance for losses on other real estate owned is established by a
charge to earnings when, upon periodic evaluation by management, further declines in the estimated fair value of properties have occurred. Such evaluations are based on an analysis of individual properties as well as a general assessment of current
real estate market conditions. Holding costs and rental income on properties are included in current operations, while certain costs to improve such properties are capitalized. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate owned are reflected
in earnings when realized.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
The allowance for loan losses is based on managements evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio and is used to provide for
losses resulting from loans that ultimately prove uncollectible. In determining the level of the allowance, periodic evaluations are made of the loan portfolio, which takes into account such factors as the character of the loans, loan status,
financial posture of the borrowers, value of collateral securing the loans and other relevant information sufficient to reach an informed judgment. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to income and reduced by loan charge-offs, net of
recoveries. Management maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Managements methodology for
assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include the formula allowance, specific allowances, if appropriate, for identified problem loans and the unallocated allowance. Arriving at an appropriate level
of allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.

While management uses available information in establishing the allowance for loan
losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. Loans are charged-off in whole or in part when, in managements opinion,
collectibility is not probable.  The formula allowance evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within
each portfolio segment. Individual loans within the commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and real estate construction loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar risk
characteristics. Changes in risk grades affect the amount of the formula allowance. Risk grades are determined by reviewing current collateral value, financial information, cash flow, payment history and other relevant facts surrounding the
particular credit. Provisions for losses on the remaining commercial and commercial real estate loans are based on pools of similar loans using a combination of historical net loss experience and qualitative adjustments. For the residential real
estate and consumer loan portfolios, the reserves are calculated by applying historical charge-off and recovery experience and qualitative adjustments to the current outstanding balance in each loan category. Loss factors are based on the
Companys historical net loss experience as well as regulatory guidelines.  Specific allowances for loan losses entail the
assignment of allowance amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment. Certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the Company will not collect all the contractual
interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. Under this method, loans are selected for evaluation based upon a change in internal risk rating, occurrence of delinquency, loan classification or nonaccrual status. A specific
allowance amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is able to be estimated on the basis of: (a) present value of anticipated future cash flows, (b) the
loans observable fair market price or (c) fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The formula
allowance and specific allowances also include managements evaluation of various conditions, including business and economic conditions, delinquency trends, charge-off experience and other quality factors. 
An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect managements estimate of probable losses. The
unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. 
Management has identified certain risk factors, which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio. These include:
(a) market risk factors, such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio and (b) unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the Companys loan portfolio. Market risk factors may consist of
changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the Companys loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral. Unique portfolio risk factors may
include industry concentrations and geographic concentrations or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the Company may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio. 
The qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. Risk characteristics relevant to
each portfolio segment are as follows:  Residential real estate  The Company generally does not originate loans with a
loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 percent and does not grant subprime loans. All loans in this segment are collateralized by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The
overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates, will have an effect on the credit quality in the segment. 
Commercial real estate  Loans in this segment are primarily income-producing properties. Also included are loans to educational
institutions, hospitals and other non-profit organizations. The underlying 
  42

cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates, which in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in
this segment. Management monitors the cash flows of these loans.  Construction loans  Loans in this segment primarily
include real estate development loans for which payment is derived from sale of the property as well as construction projects in which the property will ultimately be used by the borrower. Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an
adequate price and market conditions.  Commercial and industrial loans  Loans in this segment are made to businesses and
are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 
BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT  Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
terms of leases, if shorter. It is general practice to charge the cost of maintenance and repairs to operations when incurred; major expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. 
GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Identifiable intangible assets consist of core deposit
intangibles and are assets resulting from acquisitions that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company tests
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the segment (or reporting unit) level. Currently, the Companys
goodwill is evaluated at the entity level as there is only one reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its
association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 
The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each
reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an
indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.  SERVICING
 The Company services mortgage loans for others. Mortgage servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when
rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. The
valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and
losses. Capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into loan servicing fee income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. Servicing
assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rates and terms. Impairment is recognized
through a valuation allowance for an individual stratum, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the stratum. Changes in the valuation allowance are reported in loan servicing fee income.

STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING 
The Company follows the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation (formerly SFAS
123R) for all share-based payments, using the modified-prospective transition method. The Companys method of valuation for share-based awards granted utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was also previously used for the
Companys pro forma information required under FASB ASC 718. The Company will recognize compensation expense for its awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (straight-line attribution method),
ensuring that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equals the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that time.  During 2000 and 2004, common stockholders of the Company approved stock option plans (the Option Plans) that provide for granting of options to purchase up to 150,000 shares of Class A
common stock per plan. Under the Option Plans, all officers and key employees of the Company are eligible to receive nonqualified or incentive stock options to purchase shares of Class A common stock. The Option Plans are administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are ineligible to participate in the Option Plans. Based on managements recommendations, the Committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Directors as to persons to whom
options are to be granted, the number of shares granted to each, the option price (which may not be less than 85% of the fair market value for nonqualified stock options, or the fair market value for incentive stock options, of the shares on the
date of grant) and the time period over which the options are exercisable (not more than ten years from the date of grant). There were options to purchase an aggregate of 36,062 shares of Class A common stock exercisable at December 31,
2011.  On December 30, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the acceleration and immediate vesting of all unvested
options with an exercise price of $31.60 or greater per share. As a consequence, options to purchase 23,950 shares of Class A common stock became exercisable immediately. The average of the high and low price at which the Class A common
stock traded on December 30, 2005, the date of the acceleration and vesting, was $29.28 per share. In connection with this acceleration, the Board of Directors approved a technical amendment to each of the Option Plans to eliminate the
possibility that the terms of any outstanding or future stock option would require a cash settlement on the occurrence of any circumstance outside the control of the Company. Effective as of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB ASC 718 for
all share-based payments. The Company estimates that, as a result of this accelerated vesting, approximately $190,000 of 2006 noncash compensation expense was eliminated that would otherwise have been recognized in the Companys earnings.
 The Company decided to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options primarily to reduce the noncash compensation expense
that would otherwise be expected to be recorded in conjunction with the Companys required adoption of FASB ASC 718 in 2006. There was no earnings impact for 2006 due to the Companys adoption of FASB ASC 718. 
The Company uses the fair value method to account for stock options. All of the Companys stock options are vested, and there were no
options granted during 2011 and 2010.  INCOME TAXES 
The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under this method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in
accordance with FASB ASC 740.

The Company classifies interest resulting from underpayment of income taxes as income
tax expense in the first period the interest would begin accruing according to the provisions of the relevant tax law.  The
Company classifies penalties resulting from underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense in the period for which the Company claims or expects to claim an uncertain tax position or in the period in which the Companys judgement changes
regarding an uncertain tax position.  TREASURY STOCK 
Effective July 1, 2004, companies incorporated in Massachusetts became subject to Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act, provisions of which eliminate the concept of treasury stock and provide that shares reacquired by a company are to be treated as authorized but unissued shares. 
PENSION  The Company provides pension benefits to its employees under a noncontributory, defined benefit plan, which is funded on a current basis in compliance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and recognizes costs over the estimated employee service period.  The Company
also has a Supplemental Executive Insurance/Retirement Plan (the Supplemental Plan), which is limited to certain officers and employees of the Company. The Supplemental Plan is accrued on a current basis and recognizes costs over the
estimated employee service period.  Executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries who have at least one year of service
may participate in the Supplemental Plan. The Supplemental Plan is voluntary, and participants are required to contribute to its cost. Individual life insurance policies, which are owned by the Company, are purchased covering the life of each
participant.  RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-20,
Receivables (Topic 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. This Update requires an entity to provide disclosures that facilitate financial statement users evaluation of
(1) the nature of credit risk inherent in the entitys loan portfolio (2) how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for loan and lease losses and (3) the changes and reasons for those changes in the
allowance for loan and lease losses. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period were effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting
period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company has provided the required disclosures in Note 6.  In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations to address diversity in practice in
interpreting the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations. This ASU specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the current year business combination(s) had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. This update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310), A Creditors Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a
Troubled Debt Restructuring. This Update provides additional guidance and clarification to help creditors in determining whether a creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is

experiencing financial difficulties for purposes of determining whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). This Update is effective for the first interim
or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011, with retrospective application to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. The measurement of impairment should be done prospectively in the period of adoption for loans that are
newly identified as TDRs upon adoption of this Update. In addition, the TDR disclosures required by ASU 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses are required
beginning in the period of adoption of this Update. The Company adopted this Update in the second quarter of 2011. The Company has provided the disclosures required in Note 6.  In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860), Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. This update revises the criteria for
assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset
subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. This update removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have
the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund
substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. The amendments in this update will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The amendments will be applied
prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations.  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820),
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The guidance clarifies and expands the disclosures pertaining to unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, including the
disclosure of quantitative information related to (1) the valuation processes used, (2) the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs, and
(3) use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the assets highest and best use. The guidance also requires, for public entities, disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities not measured
at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is disclosed. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU amends the disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive
income. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) as part of the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. Under the amended guidance, all changes in OCI are to be
presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The changes are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, ending after December 15,
2011, with retrospective application required. Early application is permitted. There will be no impact on the Companys consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation. In December
2011, the FASB elected to defer the effective date of those changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate only to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in the statement of income by issuing ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Deferral
of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
This ASU is intended to reduce the complexity and cost of performing an evaluation of 
  46

impairment of goodwill. Under the new guidance, an entity will have the option of first assessing qualitative factors (events and circumstances) to determine whether it is more likely than not
(meaning a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test will be unnecessary. The amendments will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2011-08 as of January 1, 2012.  In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, Compensation  Retirement Benefits  Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic 715-80), Disclosures about an Employers Participation in a
Multiemployer Plan. This ASU requires new and expanded disclosures for individually material multiemployer pension plans. The changes are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. Early application is permitted. There will
be no impact to the consolidated financial results as the Company does not participate in any multiemployer retirement plans. 
2.     Cash and Due from Banks 
The Company is required to maintain a portion of its cash and due from banks as a reserve balance under the Federal
Reserve Act. Such reserve is calculated based upon deposit levels and amounted to $4,684,000 at December 31, 2011, and $3,543,000 at December 31, 2010.

 The weighted average remaining life of investment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2011,
was 3.9 years. An auction rate municipal obligation (ARS) is included in Obligations Issued by States and Political Subdivisions. Included in the weighted average remaining life calculation at December 31, 2011, was $154,657,000 of
U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise obligations that are callable at the discretion of the issuer. These call dates were not utilized in computing the weighted average remaining life. The contractual maturities, which were used in the table above,
of mortgage-backed securities, will differ from the actual maturities due to the ability of the issuers to prepay underlying obligations.  The following table shows the temporarily impaired securities of the Companys available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2011. This table shows the unrealized loss of securities that have
been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or less and a continuous loss position for 12 months and longer. There are 60 and 6 securities that are temporarily impaired for less than 12 months and for 12 months or longer,
respectively, out of a total of 393 holdings at December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2011, management concluded
that the unrealized losses of its investment securities are temporary in nature since they are not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers, and the Company does not intend to sell any of its debt securities and it is not likely that
it will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost. In making its other-than-temporary impairment evaluation, the Company considered the fact that the principal and interest on these
securities are from issuers that are investment grade. The change in the unrealized losses on the state and municipal securities and the nonagency mortgage-backed securities was primarily caused by changes in credit spreads and liquidity issues in
the marketplace.  In evaluating the underlying credit quality of a security, management considers several factors such as the
credit rating of the obligor and the issuer, if applicable. Internal reviews of issuer financial statements are performed as deemed necessary. In the case of privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the performance of the underlying loans is
analyzed as deemed necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows of the securities. Factors considered include the level of subordination, current and estimated future default rates, current and estimated prepayment rates, estimated loss
severity rates, geographic concentrates and origination

dates of underlying loans. In the case of marketable equity securities, the severity of the unrealized loss, the length of time the unrealized loss has existed, and the issuers financial
performance are considered.

 At December 31, 2011, the Company does not intend to sell any of its debt securities and it is not
likely that it will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost. The unrealized losses on Obligations Issued by States and Political Subdivisions were considered by management to be
temporary in nature. Full collection of those debt securities is expected because the financial condition of the obligors is considered to be sound, there has been no default in scheduled payment and the debt securities are rated investment grade.
The unrealized loss on U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises Mortgage-Backed Securities related primarily to interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold
these investments until recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011. Excluded from the table above are two equity securities that were
written down in 2008 by $76,000. The fair value is $141,000 with an unrealized gain of $32,000 at December 31, 2011. In 2008, these stocks were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired based on the extent of the decline in value and the
length of time the stocks had been trading below cost.

 Included in U.S. Government and Agency Securities are securities pledged to secure public deposits and
repurchase agreements at fair value amounting to $8,885,000 and $10,000,000 at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Also included are securities pledged for borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank at fair value amounting to $49,345,000
and $79,844,000 at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all mortgage-backed
securities are obligations of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises. Government Sponsored Enterprises primarily refer to debt securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Control of these enterprises was directly taken over by the U.S. Government in
the third quarter of 2008.  The following table shows the maturity distribution of the Companys securities

 The weighted average remaining life of investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2011,
was 4.0 years. Included in the weighted average remaining life calculation at December 31, 2011, were $24,979,000 of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises obligations that are callable at the discretion of the issuer. The actual maturities,
which were used in the table above, of mortgage-backed securities, will differ from the contractual maturities due to the ability of the issuers to prepay underlying obligations. 
The following table shows the temporarily impaired securities of the Companys held-to-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011.
This table shows the unrealized market loss of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or less and a continuous loss position for 12 months and longer. There are 2 and 0 securities that are temporarily
impaired for less than 12 months and for 12 months or longer, respectively, out of a total of 92 holdings at December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2011, management concluded that the unrealized losses of its investment securities are temporary in nature since they are not related to the underlying credit quality of the
issuers, and the Company does not intend to sell this debt security and it is not likely that it will be required to sell this debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost. In making its other-than-temporary

 Net deferred fees included in loans at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, were $666,000
and $186,000, respectively.  The Company was servicing mortgage loans sold to others without recourse of approximately
$18,220,000 and $983,000 at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The Company had $3,389,000 of loans held for sale at December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys recorded investment in impaired loans was $8,102,000 and $7,963,000, respectively. If an impaired loan is placed on nonaccrual, the loan may be
returned to an accrual status when principal and interest payments are not delinquent and the risk characteristics have improved to the extent that there no longer exists a concern as to the collectibility of principal and interest. At
December 31, 2011, there were $6,073,000 of impaired loans with a specific reserve of $741,000. At December 31, 2010, there were $2,110,000 of impaired loans with a specific reserve of $317,000. 
Loans are designated as troubled debt restructures when a concession is made on a credit as a result of financial difficulties of the
borrower. Typically, such concessions consist of a reduction in interest rate to a below-market rate, taking into account the credit quality of the note, or a deferment of payments, principal or interest, which materially alters the Banks
position or significantly extends the notes maturity date, such that the present value of cash flows to be received is materially less than those contractually established at the loans origination. Restructured loans are included in the
impaired loan category.

 During the first quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a loan for $4,823,000 with a discount of $724,000.
The entire discount is classified as an accretable discount. The Company accreted $47,000, $47,000 and $46,000 of the discount during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Directors and officers of the Company and their associates are customers of, and have other transactions with, the Company in the normal course of business. All loans and commitments included in such
transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more than normal risk of collection or present other
unfavorable features.  The following table shows the aggregate amount of loans to directors and officers of the Company and
their associates during 2011.

CREDIT QUALITY INFORMATION 
The Company utilizes a six-grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans as follows:
 Loans rated 1-3 (Pass)  Loans in this category are considered pass rated loans with low to
average risk.  Loans rated 4 (Monitor)  These loans represent classified loans that management is closely
monitoring for credit quality. These loans have had or may have minor credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2011.  Loans rated 5 (Substandard)  Substandard loans represent classified loans that management is closely monitoring for credit quality. These loans have had more significant credit quality deterioration
as of December 31, 2011.  Loans rated 6 (Doubtful)  Doubtful loans represent classified loans that
management is closely monitoring for credit quality. These loans had more significant credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2011, and are doubtful for full collection. 
Impaired  Impaired loans represent classified loans that management is closely monitoring for credit quality. A loan
is classified as impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due.  The percentage of
the allowance for loan losses allocated to construction and land development loans to total construction and land development loans increased from 3.3%, at December 31, 2010, to 5.1%, at December 31, 2011, mainly as a result of an increase
in the historical loss factor. This factor was increased to account for the incremental risk in the portfolio.  The following
table presents the Companys loans by risk rating at December 31, 2011.

IMPAIRED LOANS 
A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, except that as a
practical expedient, the Company measures impairment based on a loans observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The Companys policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans
is contained within Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following is information
pertaining to impaired loans at December 31, 2011:

There was one troubled debt restructuring, totaling $11,000, during the year ended
December 31, 2011, that subsequently defaulted.  Troubled Debt Restructurings were identified as a modification where a
concession was granted to a customer who is having financial difficulties. This concession may be below market rate, longer amortization/term, and a lower payment amount. The present value calculation of the modification did not result in an
increase in the allowance for these loans beyond any previously established allocations. The loans were modified, for the construction, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans, by reducing interest rates as well as extending
terms on the loans. The financial impact of the modifications for performing commercial and industrial loans were a $38,000 reduction in principal and a $1,000 reduction in interest payments for the year ended December 31, 2011. The financial
impact of the modifications for performing commercial real estate were a $30,000 reduction in principal and a $44,000 reduction in interest payments for the year ended December 31, 2011. The financial impact of the modifications for
nonperforming loans was a $11,000 reduction in the carrying value of the loans as a result of payments received under the modified terms of the loans.

 The Company and its subsidiaries are obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for
premises and equipment expiring in various years through 2026. Total lease expense approximated $2,007,000, $1,730,000 and $1,673,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Rental income approximated $455,000,
$438,000 and $418,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Future minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating
leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more at December 31, 2011, were as follows:

8.     Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
During the second half of 2009 and the full year of 2010 and the full year of 2011, the Companys Class A
common stock traded close to or above book value per share. Accordingly, at December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, management measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the reporting unit based on the recent stock price of the Company.
Management determined that the Companys goodwill is not considered to be impaired at December 31, 2011.  The changes
in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are shown in the table below.

9.     Fair Value Measurements 
The Company follows FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (formerly SFAS 157, Fair
Value Measurements), which among other things, requires enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The principles were effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The effective date for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities was delayed, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008. These elements were adopted on January 1, 2009. ASC 820-10 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The three broad levels
of the hierarchy are as follows:  Level I  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I are highly liquid cash instruments with quoted prices such as G-7 government, agency securities, listed equities and money market securities, as
well as listed derivative instruments.  Level II  Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active
markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments whose
fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial
instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. Instruments which are generally included in this category are corporate bonds and loans, mortgage whole loans, municipal bonds and OTC derivatives. 
  61 


Table of Contents
CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 
Level III  Instruments that have little to no pricing
observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments do not have two-way markets and are measured using managements best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management
judgment or estimation.  Instruments that are included in this category generally include certain commercial mortgage loans,
certain private equity investments, distressed debt, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, as well as certain highly structured OTC derivative contracts.  The results of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2011, are as follows:

 Impaired loan balances in the table above represent those collateral dependent loans where management has
estimated the credit loss during the year by comparing the loans carrying value against the expected realizable fair value of the collateral. Specific provisions relates to impaired loans recognized for 2011 for the estimated credit loss
amounted to $1,699,000. The Company uses discounts to appraisals, as necessary, based on managements observations of the local real estate market for loans in this category. Other real estate owned is carried at fair value less costs to sell,
based on the expected realizable fair value of collateral.

During 2011, the Company restructured $18,000,000 of FHLBB advances. Prior to restructure, the weighted average rate on these advances was 4.45% and the weighted average remaining maturity was 25 months.
Subsequent to restructure, the weighted average rate was 3.50% and the weighted average maturity was 60 months. The restructures were accounted for as a modification.  During 2010, the Company restructured $12,500,000 of FHLBB advances. Prior to restructure, the weighted average rate on these advances was 2.40% and the weighted average remaining maturity was 21 months.
Subsequent to restructure, the weighted average rate was 2.52% and the weighted average maturity was 57 months. The restructure was accounted for as a modification.  SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES  Subordinated debentures totaled $36,083,000
at December 31, 2011 and 2010. In May 1998, the Company consummated the sale of a trust preferred securities offering, in which it issued $29,639,000 of subordinated debt securities due 2029 to its newly formed unconsolidated subsidiary Century
Bancorp Capital Trust.

Century Bancorp Capital Trust II then issued 35,000 shares of Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share. These securities pay dividends at an annualized rate of
6.65% for the first ten years and then convert to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.87% for the remaining 20 years. 
OTHER BORROWED FUNDS  There were no overnight federal funds purchased at December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
The Bank serves as a Treasury Tax and Loan depository under a note option with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. This open-ended
interest-bearing borrowing carries an interest rate equal to the daily federal funds rate less 0.25%. This amount totaled $0 and $975,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
The Bank also has an outstanding loan in the amount of $143,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, borrowed against the
cash value of a whole life insurance policy for a key executive of the Bank. 
13.     Stockholders Equity 
DIVIDENDS  Holders of the Class A common stock may not vote in the election of directors but may vote as a class to approve certain extraordinary corporate transactions. Holders of Class B common stock may vote
in the election of directors. Class A common stockholders are entitled to receive dividends per share equal to at least 200% per share of that paid, if any, on each share of Class B common stock. Class A common stock is publicly
traded. Class B common stock is not publicly traded; however, it can be converted on a per share basis to Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder. Dividend payments by the Company are dependent in part on the dividends it
receives from the Bank, which are subject to certain regulatory restrictions.  EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
 Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents; basic EPS excludes all common stock equivalents.
The only common stock equivalents for the Company are the stock options discussed below. The dilutive effect of these stock options for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was an increase of 1,149, 2,236 and 2,091 shares, respectively. 
STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN  During 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reauthorization of the stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company is reauthorized to repurchase up to 300,000, or less than 9%,
of Century Bancorp Class A Common Stock outstanding. This vote supersedes the previous program voted by the Board of Directors during 2010, which also authorized the Company to repurchase up to 300,000, or less than 9%, of Century Bancorp
Class A Common Stock.  The stock buyback is authorized to take place from time-to-time, subject to prevailing market
conditions. The purchases are made on the open market and are funded from available cash. During 2009, the Company repurchased 8,110 shares at an average price of $13.04 per share.

STOCK OPTION PLAN 
During 2000 and 2004, common stockholders of the Company approved stock option plans (the Option Plans) that provide for
granting of options for not more than 150,000 shares of Class A common stock per plan. Under the Option Plans, all officers and key employees of the Company are eligible to receive nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase shares of
Class A common stock. The Option Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are ineligible to participate in the Option Plans. Based on managements recommendations, the Committee submits
its recommendations to the Board of Directors as to persons to whom options are to be granted, the number of shares granted to each, the option price (which may not be less than 85% of the fair market value for nonqualified stock options, or the
fair market value for incentive stock options, of the shares on the date of grant) and the time period over which the options are exercisable (not more than ten years from the date of grant). There were 36,062 options exercisable at
December 31, 2011.  Stock option activity under the plan is as follows:

 At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the options outstanding have exercise prices between $15.063 and
$31.83, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of two years for 2011 and three years for 2010 and 2009. The weighted average intrinsic value of options exercised for the period ended December 31, 2011, was $6.80 per share with an
aggregate value of $16,666. The average intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 had an aggregate value of $49,145, $41,895 and $74,056, respectively. 
CAPITAL RATIOS  The Bank and the Company are subject to various regulatory requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank and Companys financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Bank and Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank and Companys assets and liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank and
Companys capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1
capital (as defined in the regulation) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as 
  67

defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2011, that the Bank and the Company meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
As of December 31, 2011, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that
notification that management believes would cause a change in the Banks categorization.  The Banks actual capital
amounts and ratios are presented in the following table:

 Based on the Companys historical and current pre-tax earnings, management believes it is more likely
than not that the Company will realize the deferred income tax asset existing at December 31, 2011. Management believes that existing net deductible temporary differences which give rise to the deferred tax asset will reverse during periods in
which the Company generates net taxable income. In addition, gross deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse in periods during which offsetting gross taxable temporary differences are expected to reverse. Factors beyond
managements control, such as the general state of the economy and real estate values, can affect future levels of taxable income, and no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible
temporary differences. The Company is in an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) position. The AMT is carried as a deferred asset and has an indefinite life. The Company has potential tax planning strategies available which support the deferred
AMT and at this time no valuation allowance is needed.  The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal tax
return. For the tax year beginning in 2009, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires a combined state tax return, except for security corporations, which file separate tax returns. The Company is subject to federal examinations for tax years after
December 31, 2009, and state examinations for tax years after December 31, 2007. 
15.     Employee Benefits 
The Company has a Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the Plan), which had been offered to all
employees reaching minimum age and service requirements. In 2006, the Bank became a member of the Savings Bank Employees Retirement Association (SBERA) within which it then began maintaining the Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan.
SBERA offers a common and collective trust as the underlying investment structure for its retirement plans. The target allocation mix for the common and collective trust portfolio calls for 
  70

an equity-based investment deployment range of 40% to 64% of total portfolio assets. The remainder of the portfolio is allocated to fixed income securities with target range of 15% to 25% and
other investments including global asset allocation and hedge funds from 20% to 36%.  The Trustees of SBERA, through its
Investment Committee, select investment managers for the common and collective trust portfolio. A professional investment advisory firm is retained by the Investment Committee to provide allocation analysis, performance measurement and to assist
with manager searches. The overall investment objective is to diversify investments across a spectrum of investment types to limit risks from large market swings. The Company closed the plan to employees hired after March 31, 2006. 
Prior to 2008, the measurement date for the Plan was September 30 for each year. Beginning in 2008, the measurement date was changed
to December 31. The benefits expected to be paid in each year from 2012 to 2016 are $1,223,000, $1,295,000, $1,330,000, $1,366,000 and $1,549,000, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five years from 2017 to 2021 are
$8,764,000. The Company plans to contribute $1,800,000 to the Plan in 2012.  The fair value of plan assets and major categories
as of December 31, 2011, is as follows:

 LEVEL 1  The plan assets measured at fair value in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in an active exchange market.  LEVEL 2  Plan assets measured at fair value in Level 2 are based on
pricing models that consider standard input factors, such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, credit spreads and new issue data. 
  71 


Table of Contents
CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 
LEVEL 3 
Plan assets measured at fair value in Level 3 are based on unobservable inputs, which includes SBERAs assumptions and the best
information available under the circumstance. Level 3 assets consist of hedge funds. The underlying assets are valued based upon quoted exchange prices, over-the-counter trades, bid/ask prices, relative value assessments based on market conditions,
and other information, as available. Further adjustments may be made based on factors impacting liquidity.  The asset or
liabilitys fair value measurement level within fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Below is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.  The Trust reports bonds and other obligations, short-term investments and equity securities at fair values based on published quotations, Collective funds and hedge funds (Funds) are valued in accordance
with valuations provided by such Funds, which generally value marketable securities at the last reported sales price on the valuation date and other investments at fair value, as determined by each Funds manager. 
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future values. Furthermore, although the Trust believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result
in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.  The changes in Level 3 securities are shown in the table below:

 The performance of the plan assets is dependent upon general market conditions and specific conditions
related to the issuers of the underlying securities.  The Company has a Supplemental Executive Insurance/Retirement Plan (the
Supplemental Plan), which is limited to certain officers and employees of the Company. The Supplemental Plan is voluntary and participants are required to contribute to its cost. Under the Supplemental Plan, each participant will receive a
retirement benefit based on compensation and length of service. Life insurance policies, which are owned by the Company, are purchased covering the lives of each participant.

 Assumptions for the expected return on plan assets and discount rates in the Companys Plan and
Supplemental Plan are periodically reviewed. As part of the review, management in consultation with independent consulting actuaries performs an analysis of expected returns based on the plans asset allocation. This forecast reflects the
Companys and actuarial firms expected return on plan assets for each significant asset class or economic indicator. The range of returns developed relies on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return,
correlation and volatility for each asset class. Also, as a part of the review, the Companys management in consultation with independent consulting actuaries performs an analysis of discount rates based on expected returns of high-grade fixed
income debt securities.  The Company offers a 401(k) defined contribution plan for all employees reaching minimum age and
service requirements. The plan is voluntary and employee contributions are matched by the Company at a rate of 33.3% for the first 6% of compensation contributed by each employee. The Companys match totaled $266,000 for 2011, $244,000 for 2010
and $261,000 for 2009. Administrative costs associated with the plan are absorbed by the Company.  The Company has a cash
incentive plan that is designed to reward our executives and officers for the achievement of annual financial performance goals of the Company as well as business line, department and individual performance. The plan supports the philosophy that
management be measured for their performance as a team in the attainment of these goals. Discretionary bonus expense amounted to $1,100,000, $600,000 and $403,000 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
The Company does not offer any postretirement programs other than pensions. 
16.     Commitments and Contingencies 
A number of legal claims against the Company arising in the normal course of business were outstanding at
December 31, 2011. Management, after reviewing these claims with legal counsel, is of the opinion that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.

17.     Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk 
The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to originate and sell loans, standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans. The instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the 
  74

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 

amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these particular classes of
financial instruments.  The Companys exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
financial instrument for loan commitments, standby letters of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk at December 31 are as follows:  Contract or Notional Amount

 Commitments to originate loans, unadvanced portions of construction loans, unused lines of credit and
unused letters of credit are generally agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on managements credit evaluation of the borrower. 
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.

19.    Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of its financial instruments.
Excluded from this disclosure are all nonfinancial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair values of these assets because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  The fair value of short-term investments is
estimated using the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate used is estimated based on the rates currently offered for short-term investments of similar remaining maturities. 
SECURITIES HELD-TO-MATURITY AND SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE 
The fair value of these securities were based on quoted market prices, where available, as provided by third-party investment portfolio
pricing vendors. If quoted market prices were not available, fair values provided by the vendors were based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments in active markets and/or based on a matrix pricing methodology which employs The Bond
Market Associations standard calculations for cash flow and price/yield analysis, live benchmark bond pricing and terms/condition data available from major pricing sources. Management regards the inputs and methods used by third-party pricing
vendors to be Level 2 inputs and methods as defined in the fair value hierarchy provided by FASB. 
LOANS  For variable-rate loans, which reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts. The fair value of other loans is estimated using discounted cash
flow analysis, based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Incremental credit risk for nonperforming loans has been considered. 
ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE  The carrying amounts for accrued interest receivable and payable approximate fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 
DEPOSITS  The fair value of deposits, with no stated maturity, is equal to the carrying amount. The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows, applying interest rates
currently being offered on the deposit products of similar maturities. The fair value estimates for deposits do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of alternative
forms of funding (deposit base intangibles).  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS
 The fair value of repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds is based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows. The discount rate used is estimated based on the rates currently offered for other borrowed funds of similar remaining maturities. 
  76

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) 
 
SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES 
The fair value of subordinated debentures is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate used is estimated
based on the rates currently offered for other subordinated debentures of similar remaining maturities. 
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS  The fair values of the Companys unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans, commitments to originate and sell loans and standby letters of credit are estimated using the
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing.  The carrying amounts and fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, are as follows:

 LIMITATIONS  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the type of financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or
discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Banks entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no active market exists for some of the Banks financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on
judgments regarding future expected loss experience, cash flows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and
therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions and changes in the loan, debt and interest rate markets could significantly affect the estimates. Further, the income tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on the fair value estimates and have not been considered.

CENTURY BANCORP, INC, 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
KPMG LLP  Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm  Two Financial Center 
60 South Street  Boston, Massachusetts
02111-2759  The Board of Directors and Stockholders  Century Bancorp, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Century Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Century Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Century Bancorp, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 23, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting.

CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  KPMG LLP  Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  Two Financial Center 
60 South Street  Boston, Massachusetts
02111-2759  The Board of Directors and Stockholders  Century Bancorp, Inc.:  We have audited Century Bancorp, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Century
Bancorp, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Century Bancorp, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Century Bancorp, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 23, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

CENTURY BANCORP, INC. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
CENTURY BANCORP, INC.  400 Mystic Avenue
 Medford, Massachusetts 02155  We, together with the other members of Century Bancorp, Inc. and our subsidiary (the Company), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  The
Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.  The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page 82.

standards. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Senna qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as that term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC. The Audit Committee reviews the findings and recommendations of the FRB, FDIC, and Massachusetts Bank Commissioners staff in connection with their examinations and the internal audit reports and procedures for the
Company and its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee met five times during 2011.  Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of the
Companys accounting functions and internal controls. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter first adopted and approved by the Board of Directors in 2000. The Audit Committee has reviewed and reassessed its Charter. A copy of the
Audit Committee Charter was last published in the 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009.  Management is responsible
for the Companys internal controls and financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to issue their reports thereon. The Audit Committees responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public
accounting firm. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, the matters required to be discussed by Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, which we refer to as
SAS, No. 114, as amended (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU section 380) as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. SAS No. 114 requires KPMG LLP to discuss with our Audit Committee, among
other things, the following:   


 

 
 Views about the qualitative aspects of our accounting practices, including accounting policies and estimates and financial statement disclosures;
  


 

 
 Significant difficulties, if any, encountered during the audit; 
 


 

 
 Uncorrected misstatements, other than those that KPMG LLP believes are trivial, if any; 
 


 

 
 Disagreements with management, if any;   


 

 
 Other findings or issues, if any, arising from the audit that in KPMG LLP judgment, are significant and relevant to those charged with governance with
respect to their oversight of the financial reporting process;   


 

 
 Material, corrected misstatements that were brought to the attention of management as a result of audit procedures; 
 


 

 
 Representations the auditor is requesting from management; and 
 


 

 
 Managements consultations with other accountants.  The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and letter from KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm as required by applicable requirements of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board. Our Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the firms independence, including a review of audit and non-audit fees and services, and concluded that KPMG LLP is independent. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to in the paragraphs above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that
the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nominating Committee  The Companys Nominating Committee has three director members, Marshall I. Goldman, Stephanie Sonnabend and Jon Westling, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined to be independent under
the NASDAQ current listing standards. The Nominating Committee operates pursuant to a written policy. The nominating committee implements the process by identifying a potential candidate and evaluating whether the candidate is eligible and qualified
for service. The Committee has developed criteria for the selection of new directors to the Board, including but not limited to, diversity, age, skills, experience, time availability (including the number of other boards a director candidate sits
on), NASDAQ listing standards, applicable federal and state laws and regulations, Board and Company needs and such other criteria as the Committee shall determine to be relevant. The committees effectiveness is assessed by reviewing existing
Board of Directors attendance and performance; experience, skills and contributions that the existing Director brings to the Board; and independence, prior to nominating an existing director for reelection. 
Board Leadership Structure  The Company has implemented a careful succession plan by separating the CEO and Chairmans position. The positions were separated to retain Marshall M. Sloane, who is a valuable asset given his
history with the Company and his experience, as Chairman. Barry R. Sloane is the CEO. Marshall M. Sloane continues as Chairman of the Board. 
Oversight of Risk  The
Board oversees risk through various Board Committees which report directly to the Board. Also, various committees comprised of Company management report to the Board.  The principal Board Committees responsible for overseeing the various elements of risk are the Audit Committee, the Asset Liability Committee and the Executive Committee. The Audit Committee is
responsible for monitoring all elements of risk, primarily through its oversight of the internal audit program. The Asset Liability Committee monitors interest rate risk principally through managements models and simulations. The Executive
Committee monitors credit risk through its review of large originators, classified assets, the calculation of the allowance for loan losses and concentrations of credits.  The principal committees comprised of management are Management Committee, Corporate Risk Management Committee, Loan Approval Committee and Asset Liability Pricing Committee. Management Committee is
comprised of senior management and is responsible for overseeing all elements of risk. The Corporate Risk Management Committee meets quarterly to address specific elements of risk. Loan Approval Committee is responsible for overseeing credit risk.
The Asset Liability Committee oversees interest rate risk. The committees comprised of management report to the Board of Directors, as needed, through senior managements attendance and reporting at Board of Directors meetings. 
Code of Ethics  The
Company has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions. A copy of the Companys Code of Ethics may be obtained upon
written request to Investor Relations, Century Bancorp, Inc., 400 Mystic Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts 02155.  Section 16(a)
Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  Based solely on a review of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments
thereto, if any, and any written representations furnished to the Company, none of the Companys officers, Directors or beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Companys Class A Common Stock failed to file on a timely basis reports
required by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, or in prior fiscal years.

 Report of the Compensation Committee  Composition and Responsibilities of the Compensation Committee  The
Compensation Committee is a committee of the Board of Directors composed of Fraser Lemley as Chairman and Jon Westling, each of whom the Board has determined is independent as defined by the FINRA current listing standards. Until his resignation as
a director on December 19, 2011 to become a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Roger S. Berkowitz also served as a member of the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee oversees compensation programs applicable to employees at all levels of the Company and makes decisions regarding executive compensation that is intended to align total
compensation with business objectives and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward individuals who are contributing to the Companys success.  The Compensation Committee reviews the Companys cash incentive, stock incentive, retirement, and benefit plans and makes its recommendations to the Board with respect to these areas. 
All decisions with respect to executive and director compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee and recommended to the full
Board for ratification.  The Companys Executive Compensation Conclusion 
Based upon review, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors found the Companys Chief Executive Officers, the
Chief Financial Officers and the other Named Executive Officers total compensation to be reasonable. In addition to the other factors noted, the Committee and the Board considered that the Company maintains only one change of control
provision, one separation agreement and did not award stock incentive awards for fiscal year 2011. It should be noted that when the Committee and the Board considers any component of executive compensation, the mix and aggregate amounts of all
components are taken into consideration.

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Philosophy and Objectives of Company  The Companys executive
compensation philosophy is based on the following principles:   


 

 
 Compensation programs should be designed to attract and retain executives, to motivate them to achieve and to reward them appropriately for their
performance.   


 

 
 Compensation should be competitive and equitable in light of the executives responsibilities, experience, and performance.
  


 

 
 Provide annual compensation that takes into account the Companys performance with respect to its financial and strategic objectives, the
performance of functions and business areas under the executives management and the results of established goals;   


 

 
 Align the financial interests of the executive with those of shareholders by providing both short-term and long-term incentives;
  


 

 
 Offer a total compensation program for each executive based on (i) the level of responsibility of the executives position, (ii) the
experience and skills necessary relative to the other senior management positions, (iii) comparison of compensation to similarly positioned executives of peer financial institutions; and 
 


 

 
 Evaluate the overall compensation of our executives in light of general economic and specific company, industry and competitive considerations.
 Compensation Process  The Company maintains governance practices to ensure that it can reach its compensation-related decisions in an informed and appropriate manner. 
Base salaries, which are the Companys major element of compensation, are reviewed for executive officers and employees at the
regularly scheduled fall meeting of the Compensation Committee. At this meeting the Committee also reviews and adopts, as appropriate, proposals for the cash incentive plan for the new fiscal year, stock option grants, additions, amendments,
modifications or terminations of retirement and benefit programs.  The Compensation Committees process incorporates the
following:   


 

 
 The Committee operates under a written charter which is periodically reviewed. 
 


 

 
 The Committee meets with representatives of management to review and discuss prepared materials and issues. 
 


 

 
 The Committee considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the compensation of the Companys Named Executive
Officers.   


 

 
 Our independent compensation consultant attends Committee meetings as requested. 
 


 

 
 The Committee meets and deliberates privately without management present. Our consultant participates in these sessions as requested.
  


 

 
 The Committee may consult with the non-management and independent directors regarding decisions affecting Executive compensation.
  


 

 
 The Committee reports the Committees major actions to the entire Board at the Board of Directors meeting in December or the following
January.   


 

 
 The Committee recommends for approval to the Board of Directors the fees for our Board and Board Committees. 
 


 

 
 The Board of Directors then considers the report of the Compensation Committee and accepts or amends and approves or ratifies all matters presented for
consideration.

Table of Contents
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee or the Board may delegate to
management certain of its duties and responsibilities, including with respect to the adoption, amendment, modification or termination of benefit plans and with respect to the awards of stock options under certain stock plans. 
Compensation Consultant  When making determinations regarding the compensation paid to our executives the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors rely, in part, on the expertise of our independent compensation
consultant, Thomas Warren & Associates, to conduct an assessment of our executive compensation. In addition to conferring with certain executives, the consultant works with internal company support staff to obtain compensation and market
data. Thomas Warren & Associates identifies a group of peer companies in consideration of such factors as asset size, geography, type of financial services offered and the complexity and scope of operations and makes use of executive
compensation comparisons, published surveys and peer analyses.  The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors took
Thomas Warren & Associates recommendations into consideration when setting base salaries for fiscal 2011.  Compensation
Components  With respect to Executive compensation, the Company reviews the mix of base salary, cash and stock based
incentive plans and benefits for our individual executives, however, there is no specific formula for allocating between cash and non-cash compensation. The competitiveness of total compensation potential for our executives is reviewed against
industry practices and the Companys peers as identified by our independent compensation consultant. The major elements of the Companys executive compensation package (i.e., base salary, cash and stock based incentive plans) are similar
to those found in many companies.  Base Salary Compensation: 
When evaluating executive base salary compensation, the Company takes into consideration such factors as: 
 


 

 
 The attainment of business and strategic goals and the financial performance of the Company; 
 


 

 
 The importance, complexity, and level of responsibility of the executives position within the organizational structure;
  


 

 
 The performance of the executives business areas goals and the accomplishment of objectives for the previous year;
  


 

 
 The difficulty of achieving desired results;   


 

 
 The value of the executives unique skills, abilities and general management capabilities to support the long-term performance of the Company;
  


 

 
 The executives contribution as a member of the Executive Management Team. 
While the Company reviews numerous quantitative and qualitative factors noted above when determining executive base salary compensation,
the performance of the Companys stock is not generally considered a factor in this determination as the price of the Companys common stock is subject to various factors beyond the Companys control. The Company believes that the
price of the stock in the long-term will reflect the Companys operating performance and how well our executives manage the Company.  Ultimately, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors have the authority to use discretion when making executive compensation determinations after review of all the information that they deem
relevant.  Cash Incentive Plan:  The Company has a discretionary cash incentive plan that is designed to reward our executives and officers for the achievement of annual financial performance goals of the Company as well as business
line, department and individual performance. The plan supports the philosophy that management be measured for their performance as a team in the attainment of these goals.

Recipients of incentive compensation are selected by the Compensation Committee and approved
by the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of management, as eligible to participate in the plan.  Awards are based
upon the attainment of established objectives including profitability, expense control, sales volumes and overall job performance. Awards are generally not granted unless the Company achieves certain financial targets. 
Upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the amounts, if any, to be awarded. In recognition of
the Companys performance, discretionary awards were granted for fiscal 2011. Those for the Chief Executive Officer and the other Named Executive Officers are noted on the Summary Compensation Table. 
Stock Option Plans:  During 2000 and 2004, common stockholders of the Company approved stock option plans (the Option Plans) to encourage ownership of Class A common stock of the Company by directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Affiliates and to provide additional incentives for them to promote the success of the Companys business through awards of or relating to shares of the Companys Class A common stock.
Under the Option Plans, all officers and key employees of the Company are eligible to receive non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase shares of Class A common stock. The Option Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors, whose members are ineligible to participate in the Option Plans. Based on managements recommendations, the Committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Directors as to persons to whom options are to be
granted, the number of shares granted to each, the option price (which may not be less than 85% of the stocks trading value for non-qualified stock options, or the fair market value for incentive stock options, of the shares on the date of grant)
and the time period over which the options are exercisable (not more than ten years from the date of the grant).  The
Compensation Committee has complete discretion to make or select the manner of making all necessary determinations with respect to each option to be granted by the committee under the Option Plans including the director, employee, or officer to
receive an Option. However, in determining the long-term incentive component (stock incentive plan) of executive compensation, the Committee does consider the Companys performance and relative shareholder return, the value of similar
incentives awards at peer companies and the awards given in past years. The Committee may take into account the nature of the services provided by the respective officers, employees, and directors, their present and potential contributions to the
success of the Company, and any other factors that the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, determines are relevant. 
Option grants were not awarded in 2011.  Post-Employment Compensation  Defined Benefit Pension Plan:
 The Company had a qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan which had been offered to all employees reaching a
minimum age and service requirement. In 2006 the Bank became a member of the Savings Bank Employee Retirement Association (SBERA) within which it maintains the qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan. SBERA offers a common and collective
trust as the underlying investment structure for pension plans participating in SBERA. The Trustee of SBERA, through SBERAs Investment Committee, selects investment managers for the common and collective trust portfolio. A professional
advisory firm is retained by the Investment Committee to provide allocation analysis, performance measurement and to assist with manager searches. The overall investment objective is to diversify equity investments across a spectrum of investment
types. (e.g. small cap, large cap, international, etc) and styles (e.g. growth, value, etc.). The Company has closed the plan to employees hired after March 31, 2006.  Benefits under the plan are based upon an employees years of service and career average compensation. The 2011 increase in the actuarial present value of each Named Executive Officers
accumulated benefit under the plan is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table which appears on page 95 and the actuarial present value of each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Pension Benefits Table which appears on page 97.

  92 


Table of Contents
401(k) Plan: 
Our executives are eligible to participate in the Companys 401(k) contributory defined contribution plan. The Company contributes a
matching contribution equal to 33.33% on the first 6% of the participants compensation that has been contributed to the plan. The Chief Executive Officer and five of the Named Executive Officers participated in the 401(k) plan during fiscal
2011 and received matching contributions up to a maximum of $4,900.  In fiscal 2007, the Company transferred administration of
its 401(k) plan to SBERA who also operates the Companys Defined Benefit Pension Plan as noted above. 
Supplemental Executive Insurance/Retirement Income Plan: 
The Company has a Supplemental Executive Insurance/Retirement Plan (the Supplemental Plan) which is limited to select officers and
employees of the Company.  Executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries who have at least one year of service may
participate in the Supplemental Plan. The Supplemental Plan is voluntary and participants are required to contribute to its cost. Under the Supplemental Plan, each participant will receive a retirement benefit based on compensation and length of
service. Individual life insurance policies, which are owned by the Company, are purchased covering the lives of each participant.  Benefits under the Supplemental Plan are based upon an employees years of service and highest three year average compensation. The 2011 increase in the actuarial present value of each Named
Executive Officers accumulated benefit under the Supplemental Plan is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table which appears below and the actuarial present value of each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Supplemental Executive
Insurance/Retirement Benefits Table which appears on page 98.  Previously, the Company has entered into an agreement with
Mr. Marshall Sloane to freeze his Supplemental Executive/Insurance Retirement Income Plan benefit. In consideration of this frozen benefit, the Company has acquired a life insurance policy providing a death benefit of $25,000,000 upon the death
of the survivor of Mr. Sloane or Mrs. Sloane. Mr. Sloane has elected 50% joint and survivor annuity. Under this plan he received $523,639 in 2011.  Chief Executive Officer Compensation  The Company granted Chief Executive
Officer, Barry R. Sloane a 11% salary increase in 2011. In recognition of the Companys financial performance in 2011, the Company also granted a $126,477 cash bonus payable to Mr. Barry R. Sloane. Total compensation granted to the Chief
Executive Officer for 2011 is described in the Summary Compensation Table in the statement.  Executive Officer Compensation 
Consistent with the decisions regarding CEO base compensation, the Company determined that the base salary compensation for Named
Executive Officers, Messrs. David Woonton, Paul Evangelista, and Brian Feeney were increased by 5.3%, 5.3% and 5.3% respectively in 2011. Mr. William Hornbys base salary was increased by 13% in recognition of his contributions and to
better align his compensation with the market. Acknowledging Linda Sloane Kays increased management responsibilities, Ms. Kays base salary was increased to $237,010. In light of the Companys financial performance in 2011, cash
bonuses were awarded to all of the above Named Executive Officers as noted in the Summary Compensation Table.  The Company
based its determinations on its subjective analysis of each individuals performance and contribution to the corporations goals and objectives and considered the quantitative and qualitative factors referenced above. 
Executive Benefits  We
limit additional executive benefits that we make available to our executive officers. Where such benefits are provided, they are intended to support other business purposes including facilitating business development efforts.

Table of Contents
Separation Agreement  On May 11, 2010, the Company accepted the voluntary resignation of Co-President and Co-CEO Jonathan G. Sloane effective May 10, 2010 and entered into a separation agreement with
Mr. Jonathan Sloane. Under the terms of the separation agreement, Mr. Jonathan Sloane will continue to receive his base salary and health insurance benefits for two years through May 10, 2012. 
Consulting Services Agreement  The Company renewed its consulting agreement with Marshall M. Sloane to provide the Company advice on strategic planning and operational management, assist with business development efforts and clients,
participate in public relations and community outreach efforts and provides other services as may be requested by the Board of Directors. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Sloane an annual contract fee of $314,407 per year during 2011 with
provisions to reimburse Mr. Sloane for all related business expenses and the expense of obtaining health insurance comparable to that which the Company provided while he was Chief Executive Officer. In recognition of the Companys
financial performance, the Company also awarded Mr. Sloane a special Directors bonus for 2011 as noted on the Summary Compensation Table.  Employment Agreement  The Company has entered into an employment agreement
with Mr. David Woonton. The agreement grants two years of service payable upon a change of control of the Company.  Report of the
Compensation Committee  The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Report of the Compensation
Committee with management. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the CD&A be included in the proxy statement for the year ended
December 31, 2011 for filing with the SEC.  /s/ Fraser Lemley, Chairman

ITEM 13.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE  
Certain Directors and Officers of the Company and Bank and members of their immediate family are at present, as in the past, customers of
the Bank and have transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. In addition, certain of the Directors are at present, as in the past, also Directors, Officers or Stockholders of corporations or members of partnerships that are
customers of the Bank and have transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. Such transactions with Directors and Officers of the Company and the Bank and their families and with such corporations and partnerships were made in the
ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral on loans, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and did not involve more than the normal risk
of collectability or present other features unfavorable to the Bank. The Directors annually approve amounts to be paid to related parties for services rendered. The Company reviews related party transactions monthly. 
NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) rules, and our governance principles, require that at least a majority of our Board be composed
of independent directors. All of our directors other than Marshall M. Sloane, Barry R. Sloane, Linda Sloane Kay, George F. Swansburg and Russell B. Higley, Esq. are independent within the meaning of both the NASDAQ rules
and our own corporate governance principles. Nine of our thirteen directors, therefore, are currently independent directors.   


ITEM 14.
