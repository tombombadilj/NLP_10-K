Item 1A.
Risk Factors 


The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans found in Item 1. Business and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please also see Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results may differ materially due to the risks and
uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report, including those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance. 
Our inability to implement our strategic long range plan may have an adverse affect on our future results. 
Our ability to successfully implement and execute our long range plan is dependent on many factors. Our strategies may require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from our core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. If we cannot successfully execute our strategic growth initiatives or if the long range plan does not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. 
The retail athletic footwear and apparel business is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry. Our athletic footwear and apparel operations compete primarily with athletic footwear specialty stores, sporting goods stores and superstores, department stores, discount stores, traditional shoe stores, and mass merchandisers, many of which are units of national or regional chains that have significant financial and marketing resources. The principal competitive factors in our markets are price, quality, selection of merchandise, reputation, store location, advertising, and customer service. Our success also depends on our ability to
differentiate ourselves from our competitors with respect to shopping convenience, a quality assortment of available merchandise and superior customer service. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we sell merchandise via the Internet, a significant shift in customer buying patterns to purchasing athletic footwear, athletic apparel, and sporting goods via the Internet could have a material adverse effect on our business results. 
In addition, all of our significant vendors distribute products directly through the Internet and others may follow. Some vendors operate retail stores and some have indicated that further retail stores will open. Should this continue to occur, and if our customers decide to purchase directly from our vendors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
The industry in which we operate is dependent upon fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors. 
The athletic footwear and apparel industry is subject to changing fashion trends and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that our merchandise selection will accurately reflect customer preferences when it is offered for sale or that we will be able to identify and respond quickly to fashion changes, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of our merchandise from vendors. A substantial portion of our highest margin sales are to young males (ages 12  25), many of whom we believe purchase athletic footwear and athletic and licensed apparel as a fashion statement and are frequent purchasers. Any shift in fashion
trends that would make athletic footwear or licensed apparel less attractive to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If we do not successfully manage our inventory levels, our operating results will be adversely affected. 
We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against accumulating excess inventory. For example, we order the bulk of our athletic footwear four to six months prior to delivery to our stores. If we fail to anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers purchasing habits, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. 
Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to obtain exclusive product and the ability to purchase brand-name merchandise at competitive prices. In addition, our vendors provide volume discounts, cooperative advertising, and markdown allowances, as well as the ability to negotiate returns of excess or unneeded merchandise. We cannot be certain that such assistance from our vendors will continue in the future. 
The Company purchased approximately 82 percent of its merchandise in 2011 from its top five vendors and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its athletic product from these vendors in future periods. Approximately 61 percent was purchased from one vendor  Nike, Inc. (Nike). Each of our operating divisions is highly dependent on Nike; they individually purchase 45 to 77 percent of their merchandise from Nike. Merchandise that is high profile and in high demand is allocated by our vendors based upon their internal criteria. Although we have generally been able to purchase sufficient quantities of this
merchandise in the past, we cannot be certain that our vendors will continue to allocate sufficient amounts of such merchandise to us in the future. Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers (particularly Nike) as a result of business decisions by our suppliers or any disruption in the supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of our strong dependence on Nike, any adverse development in Nikes reputation, financial condition or results of operations or the inability of Nike to develop and manufacture products that appeal to our target customers could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to acquire merchandise at competitive prices or on competitive terms in the future. 
These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
We depend on mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations. 
Our stores in the United States and Canada are located primarily in enclosed regional and neighborhood malls. Our sales are dependent, in part, on the volume of mall traffic. Mall traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, the closing of anchor department stores, and a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers. Further, any terrorist act, natural disaster, or public health concern that decreases the level of mall traffic, or that affects our ability to open and operate stores in affected areas, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations such as in regional and neighborhood malls anchored by major department stores. We cannot be certain that desirable mall locations will continue to be available. Some traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic, driven by the overall poor economic conditions, as well as the closure of certain mall anchor tenants. 
Several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls, particularly in the United States, and because of our dependence upon these landlords for a substantial number of our locations, any significant erosion of their financial condition or our relationships with these landlords would negatively affect our ability to obtain and retain store locations. Additionally, further landlord consolidation may negatively affect our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, and public health issues may adversely affect our business. 
Natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornados may affect store and distribution center operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from vendors for sale to our customers. Public health issues, such as flu or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to
conduct our business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt the operations of our suppliers, our operations, our customers, or have an adverse effect on customer demand. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products. 
We may experience fluctuations in and cyclicality of our comparable-store sales results. 
Our comparable-store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable-store sales results, including, among others, fashion trends, the highly competitive retail store sales environment, economic conditions, timing of promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, calendar shifts of holiday periods, and weather conditions. Many of our products, particularly high-end athletic footwear and licensed apparel, represent discretionary purchases. Accordingly, customer demand for these products could decline in a
recession or if our customers develop other priorities for their discretionary spending. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Our operations may be adversely affected by economic or political conditions in other countries. 
A significant portion of our sales and operating income for 2011 was attributable to our operations in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. As a result, our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States such as foreign customer preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in economic conditions in countries in which we operate, and labor and employment practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions that may differ significantly from those that prevail in the United States. Although we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts to reduce the effect of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our operations may be adversely affected by significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as it relates to certain foreign currencies. 
In addition, because we and our suppliers have a substantial amount of our products manufactured in foreign countries, our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on favorable terms may be affected by governmental regulations, trade restrictions, and economic, labor, and other conditions in the countries from which our suppliers obtain their product. 
We operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which is broader in scope than the FCPA, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Our continued expansion outside the
U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Macroeconomic developments, such as the recent recessions in Europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the European Union, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies. 
The Companys performance is subject to global economic conditions and the related impact on consumer spending levels. The continuing European sovereign debt crisis could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers and also reducing the value of our European earnings when translated into U.S. dollars. This uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news, and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products
and services. 
As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit and lower home prices. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis. These and
other economic factors could adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services and the Companys financial condition and operating results. 
Instability in the financial markets may adversely affect our business. 
Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Although we currently have a revolving credit agreement in place until 2017 and do not have any borrowings under it (other than amounts used for standby letters of credit), tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of the Companys securities. Additionally, our borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies ratings, which are
based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics, including lease-adjusted leverage ratios. 
The Company relies on a few key vendors for a majority of its merchandise purchases (including a significant portion from one key vendor). The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise. Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
If our long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges. 
We review our long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets when events indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. We determine fair value based on a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market-based approach. If an impairment trigger is identified, the carrying value is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate. Impairment losses are significantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates
of fair value. Our estimates of future operating cash flows are identified from our strategic long-range plans, which are based upon our experience, knowledge, and expectations; however, these estimates can be affected by such factors as our future operating results, future store profitability, and future economic conditions, all of which can be difficult to predict. Any significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could affect the fair value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Material changes in the market value of the securities we hold may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
At January 28, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $851 million. The majority of our investments were short-term deposits in highly-rated banking institutions. As of January 28, 2012, the Company had $498 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. We regularly monitor our counterparty credit risk and mitigate our exposure by making short-term investments only in highly-rated institutions and by limiting the amount we invest in any one institution. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties. At January 28, 2012, almost all of the investments were in institutions rated A or better from a
major credit rating agency. Despite those ratings, it is possible that the value or liquidity of our investments may decline due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and bank-specific credit issues. 
The trust which holds the assets of our U.S. pension plan has assets totaling $546 million at January 28, 2012. The fair values of these assets held in the trust are compared to the plans projected benefit obligation to determine the pension funding liability. We attempt to mitigate risk through diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and credit issues. Such
declines could have an impact on the funded status of our pension plans and future funding requirements. 
Our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher-than-expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities. 
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory rates, and enacted tax rules, including transfer pricing. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including shifts in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, changes in tax laws or related interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, and tax assessments and related interest and penalties resulting from income tax audits. 
A substantial portion of our cash and investments is invested outside of the U.S. As we plan to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Recent proposals to reform U.S. tax rules may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of U.S. income tax on our foreign earnings, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate. Any of these changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. Fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business. 
We operate four distribution centers worldwide to support our businesses. In addition to the distribution centers that we operate, we have third-party arrangements to support our operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. If complications arise with any facility or any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, the Companys other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands. This may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. We depend upon third-party carriers for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise. An interruption in service by these
carriers for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in our business, a loss of sales and profits, and other material adverse effects.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our freight cost is affected by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Increases in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of sales. We enter into diesel fuel forward and option contracts to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with the variability caused by these surcharges. 
Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. 
Information technology is a critically important part of our business operations. We depend on information systems to process transactions, manage inventory, operate our websites, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost-efficient operations. There is a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses,
computer hackers or other causes. 
Our business involves the storage and transmission of customers personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Companys data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes, as well as enforcement of standard data protection policies such as Payment Card Industry compliance. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate critical findings. Additionally, we
certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification measures. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness. 
While we believe that our security technology and processes are adequate in preventing security breaches and in reducing cyber-security risks, given the ever increasing abilities of those intent on breaching cyber-security measures and given our reliance on the security and other efforts of third-party vendors, the total security effort at any point in time may not be completely effective and any such security breaches and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors, loss of customers
and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees, and those with whom we do business. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by the Company could also severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, and harm our business. 
Risks associated with Digital operations. 
Our digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and mobile sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunications failures, and similar disruptions. Also, we may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our digital commerce. 
Business risks related to digital commerce include risks associated with the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, Internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, governmental regulation and legal uncertainties with respect to the Internet, and collection of sales or other taxes by additional states or foreign jurisdictions. If any of these risks materializes, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our reliance on key management, store and field associates. 
Future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management team, as well as store personnel and field management. Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain additional qualified management in the future. Competition for key executives in the retail industry is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified associates. Many of the store and field associates are in entry level or part-time positions
with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain quality associates, our ability to meet our growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised. In addition, a large number of our retail employees are paid the prevailing minimum wage, which if increased would negatively affect our profitability. 
We face risks arising from recent activity by the National Labor Relations Board in the United States. 
There have been recent decisions, and administrative regulations issued, by the National Labor Relations Board that, if not successfully challenged, would significantly change the nature of how union elections are to be conducted in the United States. These recent decisions and regulations could impose more labor relations requirements and union activity on our business conducted in the United States, thereby potentially increasing our costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our overall competitive position. 
Health care reform could adversely affect our business. 
In 2010, Congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits. Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation, the current lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall effect of the statute and related regulations on our business over
the coming years. Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we conduct business. 
Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively affect our business. 
There has been an increasing focus and significant debate on global climate change recently, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies globally. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as-yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the United States to combat climate change could result in future increases in taxes or in the cost of transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and could necessitate future additional investments in facilities and equipment. We are unable to predict the potential effects that
any such future environmental initiatives may have on our business. 
We may be adversely affected by regulatory and litigation developments. 
We are exposed to the risk that federal or state legislation may negatively impact our operations. Changes in federal or state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters, including class actions and patent infringement claims, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and
financial performance.

Indexed Share Price Performance 
 
The Company has previously used the Russell 2000 Index in its performance graph. However, due to the increasing size of the Companys market capitalization it was determined that the Russell Midcap Index is a more appropriate benchmark as the median market capitalization is the closest in the Russell family of indices to the Companys. The next graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on Foot Locker, Inc.s common stock relative to the total returns of the S&P 400 Retailing Index and the Russell Midcap Index. It is the Companys intention to use the Russell Midcap Index for future performance graphs.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
In the following tables, the Company has presented certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP. The Company believes this non-GAAP information is a useful measure to investors because it allows for a more direct comparison of the Companys performance for 2011 as compared with 2010 and is useful in assessing the Companys progress in achieving its long-term financial objectives. The following represents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed throughout the Overview of Consolidated Results:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company estimates the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying its effective tax rate to deductible items. The gain recorded with respect to The Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. was recorded with no tax expense due to the fact that the entity that held the investment has a zero statutory tax rate. During 2009, the provincial tax rates in Canada were reduced, which resulted in a $4 million reduction in the value of the Companys net deferred tax assets. 
When assessing Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), the Company adjusts its results to reflect its operating leases as if they qualified for capital lease treatment. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the presentation of these leases as capital leases is appropriate. Accordingly, the asset base and net income amounts are adjusted to reflect this in the calculation of ROIC. ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation. 
The closest GAAP measure is Return on Assets (ROA) and is also represented below. ROA increased to 9.4 percent as compared with 5.9 percent in the prior year reflecting the Companys overall performance in 2011.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Overview of Consolidated Results 
In March of 2010, the Company announced a strategic plan, which included a series of operating initiatives and long-term financial objectives to achieve its vision of becoming the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. Several of those objectives were exceeded during 2011 and progress was made towards attaining many of the metrics. In March 2012, an updated long-range plan and new long-term financial objectives were announced in light of our progress over the first two years of our long-range plan. Our updated objectives and 2011 results are presented below:

The Company recorded net income from continuing operations of $278 million, or $1.80 per diluted share in 2011; this compares with $169 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the prior-year period. Included in the results are impairment charges related to the CCS tradename intangible asset of $5 million and $10 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these charges in both periods, as well as the money market gain in 2010, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 65 percent to $1.82 per share in 2011 from $1.10 in 2010. Other highlights of our 2011 financial performance include: 




Sales increased by 11.4 percent and comparable-store sales increased by 9.8 percent as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. This increase was in addition to the 2010 comparable-store increase of 5.8 percent, reflecting the success of our strategic plan and the continuing favorable athletic trend. 






Gross margin increased 190 basis points in 2011 as compared with 2010. The cost of merchandise rate improved by 70 basis points for the same period, while our buyers and occupancy expenses improved by 120 basis points reflecting improved leverage on higher sales. 






Selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.1 percent of sales, an improvement of 40 basis points as compared with the prior year. 






Cash and cash equivalents at January 28, 2012 were $851 million, representing an increase of $155 million. 






Cash flow provided from operations was $497 million representing an increase of $171 million as compared with the prior year. This increase reflects the strong sales performance coupled with improved merchandise management. Merchandise inventories, excluding foreign currency fluctuations increased by 1.6 percent while sales, excluding foreign currency fluctuations, increased by 9.7 percent. 






Capital expenditures during 2011 totaled $152 million and were primarily directed to the remodeling or relocation of 182 stores, the build-out of 70 new stores, and continued improvements to our websites features and functionality, furthering the cross channel experience. 






Dividends totaling $101 million were declared and paid. Effective with the first quarter 2012 dividend payment, the dividend rate was increased by 9 percent to $0.18 per share. 






A total of $104 million, or 4.9 million shares, were repurchased as part of the previously announced share repurchase program. On February 14, 2012, a new 3-year, $400 million share repurchase program extending through January 2015 was approved. 






ROIC increased to 11.8 percent as compared with the prior-year result of 8.3 percent, reflecting profitability improvements and a more efficient balance sheet.

The year ended January 30, 2010 includes non-cash impairment charges totaling $32 million, which were recorded to write-down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions. 





(2)
Included in the results for the year ended January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 are non-cash impairment charges of $5 million and $10 million, respectively, to write down the CCS tradename intangible asset. Included in the results for the year ended January 30, 2010 is a non-cash impairment charge of $4 million to write off software development costs. 





(3)
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company increased its 1993 Repositioning and 1991 Restructuring reserve by $1 million for repairs necessary to one of the locations comprising this reserve. During the year ended January 30, 2010, the Company adjusted its 1999 restructuring reserves to reflect a favorable lease termination. These amounts are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 





(4)
During 2009, the Company restructured its organization by consolidating the Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker U.S., Kids Foot Locker, and Footaction businesses in addition to reducing corporate staff, resulting in a $5 million charge. 





(5)
Included in the year ended January 29, 2011 is a $2 million gain to reflect the Companys settlement of its investment in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund. 


Sales 
All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales from stores (including sales from the Direct-to-Customers segment and sales from stores that have been relocated or remodeled during the relevant periods) that are open at the period-end, that have been open for more than one year, and exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Stores opened and closed during the period are not included. Sales from acquired businesses that include the purchase of inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store sales after 15 months of operations. 
Sales in 2011 increased to $5,623 million, or by 11.4 percent as compared with 2010. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 9.7 percent as compared with 2010. Comparable-store sales increased by 9.8 percent. This increase primarily reflects higher footwear sales. Apparel and accessories sales also increased, which represented approximately 24 percent of sales, reflecting a modest increase over the corresponding prior-year period of 23 percent. 
Sales of $5,049 million in 2010 increased by 4.0 percent from sales of $4,854 million in 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 4.6 percent as compared with 2009. Comparable-store sales increased by 5.8 percent.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Gross Margin 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 31.9 percent in 2011, increasing by 190 basis points as compared with 2010. This increase reflected a 70 basis points improvement in the merchandise margin rate, which is attributable to an improved inventory position, better merchandise flow, and lower markdowns as the Company was less promotional during 2011. The effect of vendor allowances, as compared with the prior year, contributed 10 basis points to this improvement. The increase in the gross margin rate also included a decrease of 120 basis points in the occupancy and buyers salary expense rate reflecting improved leverage on largely fixed costs. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 30.0 percent in 2010 increasing 260 basis points as compared with 2009. In 2009, the Company recorded a $14 million inventory reserve on certain aged apparel as part of its new apparel strategy. Excluding this charge, gross margin would have increased by 230 basis points as compared with 2009. This increase reflected an increase of 150 basis points in the merchandise margin rate reflecting lower markdowns as the Company was less promotional during the year as compared with the prior year. Lower vendor allowances during the current year, reflecting the overall lower promotional activity, negatively affected
gross margin by 10 basis points. The increase in the gross margin also reflected a decrease of 80 basis points in the occupancy and buyers salary expense rate due to improved leverage and expense reductions. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $106 million to $1,244 million in 2011, or by 9.3 percent, as compared with 2010. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.1 percent as compared with 22.5 percent in 2010. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations in 2011, SG&A increased by $86 million. This increase primarily reflects higher variable expenses to support sales, such as store wages and banking expenses. Also during 2011, the Company increased its marketing and advertising spending by $25 million in order to support the Companys strategic objective of differentiating its
formats. 
SG&A expenses increased by $39 million to $1,138 million in 2010, or by 3.5 percent, as compared with 2009. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.5 percent as compared with 22.6 percent in 2009, due to expense management and the increase in sales. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, SG&A increased by $47 million. This increase primarily reflects higher incentive compensation costs totaling $45 million, partially offset by expense management efforts. 
Corporate Expense 
Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Companys corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $11 million, $12 million, and $13 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
Corporate expense increased by $5 million to $102 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. The increase represents primarily higher share-based compensation expense and miscellaneous professional fees. 
Corporate expense increased by $30 million to $97 million in 2010 as compared with 2009. Incentive compensation costs represented an increase of $29 million as a result of the Companys outperformance as compared with plan. Additionally, 2009 included a $5 million charge related to the reorganization of its operations and corporate staff reductions. 
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization of $110 million increased by 3.8 percent in 2011 from $106 million in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations increased depreciation and amortization expense by $2 million. 

20

 
 

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Depreciation and amortization of $106 million decreased by 5.4 percent in 2010 from $112 million in 2009. This decrease primarily reflects reduced depreciation and amortization resulting from store long-lived asset impairment charges recorded in 2009. Additionally, foreign currency fluctuations reduced depreciation and amortization expense by $1 million.

The overall reduction in net interest expense in 2011 as compared with 2010 primarily reflected increased income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances. 
The reduction of net interest expense of $1 million in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily related to increased income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher fees associated with the revolving credit facility. 
The Company did not have any short-term borrowings for any of the periods presented. 
Other Income 
Other income was $4 million in both 2011 and 2010 and was $3 million in 2009. For 2011, other income primarily includes $2 million of lease termination gains related to the sales of leasehold interests, $1 million for insurance recoveries, as well as royalty income. For 2010, other income includes a $2 million gain on its money-market investment, as well as royalty income, and gains on lease terminations related to certain lease interests in Europe. Other income in 2009 primarily reflects $4 million related to gains from insurance recoveries, gains on the purchase and retirement of bonds, and royalty income, partially offset by foreign currency option
contract premiums of $1 million. 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax rate for 2011 was 36.0 percent, as compared with 34.3 percent in 2010. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of the provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be adjusted as a result of new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. The effective tax rate for 2011 includes reserve releases of $3 million due to audit settlements and lapses
of statutes of limitations as well as other true-up adjustments. Excluding these items and the prior-year adjustments discussed below, the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the higher proportion of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions in 2011. 
The effective tax rate for 2010 was 34.3 percent, as compared with 36.0 percent in 2009. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a benefit of $7 million from a favorable tax settlement offset in part by $4 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter to correct a historical error in the calculation of income taxes on amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss pertaining to the Companys Canadian pension plans. Additionally, the 2009 effective rate included Canadian provincial tax rate changes that resulted in a $4 million expense arising from a reduction in the value of the Companys net deferred tax assets.
Excluding these items, the effective rate increased as compared with the prior year reflecting a higher proportion of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions.

Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, primarily related to the euro, sales from the Athletic Stores segment increased by 8.9 percent in 2011. Comparable-store sales also increased 8.9 percent as compared with the prior year. The majority of the increase represented increased footwear sales reflecting the continued success of key styles of technical, light-weight running and basketball footwear. Apparel sales continue to benefit from offerings that coordinate with key footwear styles. All formats within this segment
experienced significant increases in sales as compared with the prior year, except for Lady Foot Locker. While Foot Locker Europes comparable-stores sales were positive for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2011, sales were negatively affected by the current economic conditions. Lady Foot Lockers sales declined in 2011, principally due to operating 47 fewer stores. This was coupled with a decline in toning footwear sales, which negatively affected the results earlier in the year. Management is performing a strategic review of the womens business and is developing various initiatives intended to improve future performance. 
Athletic Stores reported a division profit of $495 million in 2011 as compared with $329 million in 2010, an increase of $166 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Foreign currency fluctuations positively affected division profit by approximately $8 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects the strong U.S. performance, led by Foot Locker and Champs Sports, however all international locations also increased. Strong sales and improved gross margin contributed to an overall profit flow-through of 33.7 percent. 
2010 compared with 2009 
Athletic Stores sales of $4,617 million increased 3.8 percent in 2010, as compared with $4,448 million in 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, primarily related to the euro, sales from the Athletic Stores segment increased by 4.4 percent in 2010. Comparable-store sales for the Athletic Stores segment increased 5.7 percent as compared with the prior year. The Companys U.S. operations sales increased 3.9 percent reflecting meaningful increases in all formats, except for Lady Foot Locker. Lady Foot Locker was negatively affected by the lower demand for certain styles, in particular toning. Excluding the effect of foreign
currency fluctuations, international sales increased 5.5 percent in 2010 as compared with 2009. Foot Locker Europes sales reflected strong increases in mens footwear and apparel. 
Athletic Stores reported a division profit of $329 million in 2010 as compared with $114 million in 2009. The 2009 results included impairment charges totaling $32 million, which were recorded to write down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements, at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions for 787 stores. Additionally, in 2009 the Company recorded a $14 million inventory reserve on certain aged apparel. Excluding these charges, division profit increased by $169 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. This increase reflects division profit gains in
both the Companys domestic and international operations. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively affected division profit by approximately $4 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.

2011 compared with 2010 
Direct-to-Customers sales increased 18.8 percent to $513 million in 2011, as compared with $432 million in 2010. Internet sales increased by 21.9 percent to $457 million, as compared with Internet sales of $375 million 2010. Internet sales primarily reflected the strong performance of the Eastbay website, coupled with improved sales from the store-banner websites. Catalog sales decreased by 1.8 percent to $56 million in 2011 from $57 million in 2010. 
The Direct-to-Customers business generated division profit of $45 million in 2011, as compared with $30 million in 2010. Division profit, as a percentage of sales, was 8.8 percent in 2011 and 6.9 percent in 2010. During the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, impairment charges of $5 million and $10 million, respectively, were recorded to write down CCS intangible assets, specifically the non-amortizing tradename. The impairments were primarily the result of reduced revenue projections. Excluding the impairment charges in each of the periods, division profit increased by $10 million reflecting the strong sales performance, partially offset by higher
variable costs. 
2010 compared with 2009 
Direct-to-Customers sales increased 6.4 percent to $432 million in 2010, as compared with $406 million in 2009. Effective with the first quarter of 2010, CCS Internet and catalog sales have been included in the computation of comparable-store sales. Internet sales increased by 9.0 percent to $375 million, as compared with 2009 reflecting a strong sales performance through the Companys store banner websites, which benefited from improved functionality and more compelling product assortments. Catalog sales decreased by 8.1 percent to $57 million in 2010 from $62 million in 2009. 
The Direct-to-Customers business generated division profit of $30 million in 2010, as compared with $32 million in 2009. Division profit, as a percentage of sales, was 6.9 percent in 2010 and 7.9 percent in 2009. Included in the 2010 division profit is a $10 million impairment charge, which was recorded to write down CCS intangible assets. The impairment was primarily the result of reduced revenue projections. Included in 2009 division profit is a $4 million impairment charge, which was recorded to write off certain software development costs as a result of managements decision to terminate the project. Excluding these charges, division profit
increased by $4 million as compared with the prior year. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Liquidity 
The Companys primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to: fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, Internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of its short-term and long-term operating strategies. The Company generally finances real estate with operating leases. Management believes its cash, cash equivalents,
future cash flow from operations, and the Companys current revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund these requirements. 
As of January 28, 2012, the Company had $498 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. Because we plan to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Depending on the source, amount, and timing of a repatriation, some tax may be payable. The Company believes that its cash invested domestically, future domestic cash flows, and its current revolving credit agreement are sufficient to satisfy domestic requirements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. On February 14, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors approved a new 3-year, $400 million share repurchase program extending through January 2015, replacing the previous $250 million program. 
Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of the Companys merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, the Companys reliance on a few key vendors for a significant portion of its merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the heading Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, could affect the ability of the Company to continue to fund its needs from
business operations. 
Maintaining access to merchandise that the Company considers appropriate for its business may be subject to the policies and practices of its key vendors. Therefore, the Company believes that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with its key vendors. In both 2011 and 2010, the Company purchased approximately 82 percent of its merchandise from its top five vendors and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its athletic product from these vendors in future periods. Approximately 61 percent in 2011 and 63 percent in 2010 was purchased from one vendor  Nike, Inc. 
The Companys 2012 planned capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs are approximately $160 million. Planned capital expenditures are $147 million and planned lease acquisition costs related to the Companys operations in Europe are $13 million. The Companys planned capital expenditures include $110 million related to modernizations of existing stores and the planned opening of 82 new stores, as well as $37 million for the development of information systems and infrastructure. The Company has the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program, should the Companys financial position
require it. 
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure) 
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, the Company uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Companys underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S.
GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Operating Activities 
Operating activities from continuing operations provided cash of $497 million in 2011 as compared with $326 million in 2010. These amounts reflect income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Non-cash impairment and other charges were $5 million and $10 million for the years ending January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, reflecting the CCS tradename impairment charges. During 2011, the Company contributed $28 million to its U.S. and Canadian qualified pension plans as compared with $32 million contributed in 2010. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the change in accounts payable, as
compared with the prior-year period, reflects the continued improvement in flowing merchandise. The change in income tax receivables and payables primarily reflects the receipt of a $46 million IRS refund resulting from a loss carryback. 
Operating activities from continuing operations provided cash of $326 million in 2010 as compared with $346 million in 2009. Non-cash impairment and other charges were $10 million and $36 million for the years ending January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. The 2009 charges totaled $36 million, comprised of $32 million to write-down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions and $4 million to write off software development costs. During 2010, the Company contributed $32 million to its U.S. and Canadian qualified
pension plans as compared with $100 million contributed in 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the change in accounts payable, as compared with the prior-year period, represents inventory required to support the favorable sales trend. During 2010, the Company paid $24 million to settle the liability associated with the terminated European net investment hedge, whereas in the prior-year period the Company terminated its interest rate swaps and received $19 million. 
Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities of the Companys continuing operations was $149 million in 2011 as compared with $87 million used in investing activities in 2010. Capital expenditures were $152 million, primarily related to the remodeling of 182 stores, the build-out of 70 new stores, and various corporate technology upgrades and e-commerce website enhancements, representing an increase of $55 million as compared with the prior year. 
Net cash used in investing activities of the Companys continuing operations was $87 million in 2010 as compared with $72 million used in investing activities in 2009. During 2010, the Company received $9 million from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund representing further redemptions. Capital expenditures were $97 million primarily related to store remodeling and to the development of information systems and infrastructure, representing an increase of $8 million as compared with the prior year. 
Financing Activities 
Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $178 million in 2011 as compared with $127 million in 2010. During 2011, the Company repurchased 4,904,100 shares of its common stock under its common share repurchase program for $104 million. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $101 million and $93 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing a quarterly rate of $0.165 and $0.15 per share in 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011 and 2010, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $22 million and $13
million, respectively. During 2011, in connection with stock option exercises, the Company recorded excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $5 million as a financing activity.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $127 million in 2010 as compared with $94 million in 2009. During 2010, the Company repurchased 3,215,000 shares of its common stock for $50 million. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $93 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing a quarterly rate of $0.15 per share in both 2010 and 2009. During 2010 and 2009, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $13 million and $3 million, respectively. During 2010, in connection with stock option
exercises, the Company recorded excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $3 million as a financing activity. 
Capital Structure 
On January 27, 2012, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement) with its banks, replacing the 2009 Credit Agreement. The 2011 Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million asset based revolving credit facility maturing on January 27, 2017. In addition, during the term of the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement, the Company may make up to four requests for additional credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million. Interest is based on the LIBOR rate in effect at the time of the borrowing plus a 1.25 to 1.50 percent margin depending on certain provisions as
defined in the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement. 
The 2011 Restated Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of the Companys domestic assets, including certain inventory assets, but excluding intellectual property. The Company is not required to comply with any financial covenants as long as there are no outstanding borrowings. With regard to the payment of dividends and share repurchases, there are no restrictions if the Company is not borrowing and the payments are funded through cash on hand. If the Company is borrowing, Availability as of the end of each fiscal month during the subsequent projected six fiscal months following the payment must be at least 20 percent of
the lesser of the Aggregate Commitments and the Borrowing Base (as defined in the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement). The Companys management does not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2012, other than amounts used to support standby letters of credit. 
Credit Rating 
As of March 26, 2012, the Companys corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service are BB and Ba3, respectively. In addition, Moodys Investors Service has rated the Companys senior unsecured notes B1. 
Debt Capitalization and Equity (non-GAAP Measure) 
For purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization, the Company includes the present value of operating lease commitments in total net debt. Total net debt including the present value of operating leases is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The present value of operating leases is discounted using various interest rates ranging from 4.25 percent to 14.5 percent, which represent the Companys incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the inclusion of the present value of operating leases in total debt is useful
to our investors, credit constituencies, and rating agencies.

The Company increased cash and cash equivalents by $155 million during 2011, the result of strong cash flow generation from operating activities. The change in total debt including the present value of the operating leases, as compared with the prior-year period, primarily reflects the effect of lease renewals, offset, in part, by store closures and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Including the present value of operating leases, the Companys net debt capitalization percent decreased 300 basis points in 2011.

(1)
The amounts presented above represent the contractual maturities of the Companys long-term debt, including interest; however, it excludes the unamortized gain of the interest rate swap of $15 million. Additional information is included in the Long-Term Debt note under Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 





(2)
The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance, and other costs. These costs have historically represented approximately 25 to 30 percent of the minimum rent amount. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are unknown. 





(3)
The Companys other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 28, 2012 primarily comprise pension and postretirement benefits, deferred rent liability, income taxes, workers compensation and general liability reserves, and various other accruals. Other than this liability, other amounts (including the Companys unrecognized tax benefits of $65 million) have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. The timing of the remaining amounts that are known has not been included as they are minimal and not useful to the presentation. Additional information is included in the Other Liabilities, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, and Retirement Plans and Other Benefits notes under Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 





(4)
Represents the unused domestic lines of credit pursuant to the Companys $200 million revolving credit agreement. The Companys management currently does not expect to borrow under the facility in 2012, other than amounts used to support standby letters of credit.

(5)
Represents open purchase orders, as well as other commitments for merchandise purchases, at January 28, 2012. The Company is obligated under the terms of purchase orders; however, the Company is generally able to renegotiate the timing and quantity of these orders with certain vendors in response to shifts in consumer preferences. 





(6)
Represents payments required by non-merchandise purchase agreements. 


The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business as disclosed above, or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities. The Companys policy prohibits the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure. 
In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, the Company may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, management believes that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. The Company is also operating certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of
being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Managements responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the Companys financial statements requires diligent application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, the Companys accounting policies and methods are those specifically required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data is a summary of the Companys most significant accounting policies. In some cases, management is required to calculate amounts based on estimates for
matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company believes the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments. 
Merchandise Inventories 
Merchandise inventories for the Companys Athletic Stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (RIM). The RIM is commonly used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. The RIM is a system of averages that requires managements
estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink, among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts. 
Significant judgment is required for these estimates and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company provides reserves based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent markdowns includes many factors, including the current environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. Management believes this method
and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable. 
Vendor Reimbursements 
In the normal course of business, the Company receives allowances from its vendors for markdowns taken. Vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in the period in which the markdowns are taken. Vendor allowances contributed 30 basis points to the 2011 gross margin rate. The Company also has volume-related agreements with certain vendors, under which it receives rebates based on fixed percentages of cost purchases. These volume-related rebates are recorded in cost of sales when the product is sold and were not significant to the 2011 gross margin rate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company receives support from some of its vendors in the form of reimbursements for cooperative advertising and catalog costs for the launch and promotion of certain products. The reimbursements are agreed upon with vendors for specific advertising campaigns and catalogs. Cooperative income, to the extent that it reimburses specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to date, is recorded in SG&A in the same period as the associated expenses are incurred. Cooperative reimbursements amounted to approximately 18 percent and 11 percent of total advertising and catalog costs, respectively, in 2011. Reimbursements received that are in
excess of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to date are recognized as a reduction to the cost of merchandise and are reflected in cost of sales as the merchandise is sold and were not significant in 2011. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
The Company recognizes an impairment loss when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. Managements policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists, a triggering event, comprises measurable operating performance criteria at the division level as well as qualitative measures. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, the Company uses assumptions, which are predominately identified from the Companys strategic long-range plans, in determining the impairment amount. In the calculation of the fair value of
long-lived assets, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the Companys weighted-average cost of capital. Management believes its policy is reasonable and is consistently applied. Future expected cash flows are based upon estimates that, if not achieved, may result in significantly different results. 
The Company performs an impairment review of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of the Company and macroeconomic conditions affecting retail. The Company has chosen to perform this review at the beginning of each fiscal year, and it is done in a two-step approach. The initial step requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. The
second step  to evaluate goodwill of a reporting unit for impairment  is only required if the carrying value of that reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company used a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market-based approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. The market approach requires judgment and uses one or more methods to compare the reporting unit with similar businesses, business ownership interests or securities that have been sold. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ
from those estimates. 
The Company evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units, and concluded they are reasonable and are consistent with prior valuations. 
Owned trademarks and tradenames that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment. The fair values of purchased intangible assets are estimated and compared to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and
trends, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates, and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Companys review of goodwill did not result in any impairment charges for the years ended January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 as the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeds its carrying value. 
The Company recorded impairment charges of $5 million and $10 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to its CCS tradename, primarily as a result of reduced revenue projections for this business. 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company estimates the expected term of options granted using its historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination patterns, which the Company believes are representative of future behavior. Changing the expected term by one year changes the fair value by 7 to 9 percent depending if the change was an increase or decrease to the expected term. The Company estimates the expected volatility of its common stock at the grant date using a weighted-average of the Companys historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on
the Companys common stock. A 50 basis point change in volatility would have a 1 percent change to the fair value. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected dividend yield is derived from the Companys historical experience. A 50 basis point change to the dividend yield would change the fair value by approximately 4 percent. The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on its historical pre-vesting forfeiture data, which it believes are representative of future behavior, and periodically will revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can
materially affect the fair value of the options. The Company may elect to use different assumptions under the Black-Scholes option pricing model in the future if there is a difference between the assumptions used and the actual factors that become known over time. 
Pension and Postretirement Liabilities 
The Company determines its obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities based upon assumptions related to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on invested plan assets, salary increases, age, and mortality, among others. Management reviews all assumptions annually with its independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and the Companys intentions with regard to the plans. 
Long-Term Rate of Return Assumption  The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return expected to be earned on the plans assets and is recognized as a component of pension expense. The rate is based on the plans weighted-average target asset allocation, as well as historical and future expected performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is selected to obtain an investment return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce future contributions by the Company. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to
reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy. The weighted-average long-term rate of return used to determine 2011 pension expense was 6.59 percent. A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return would have increased 2011 pension expense by approximately $3 million. The actual return on plan assets in a given year typically differs from the expected long-term rate of return, and the resulting gain or loss is deferred and amortized into expense over the average life expectancy of its inactive participants.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discount Rate  An assumed discount rate is used to measure the present value of future cash flow obligations of the plans and the interest cost component of pension expense and postretirement income. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. In 2011, the Company changed how the discount rate was selected to measure the present value of U.S. benefit obligations from the Citibank Pension Discount curve to Towers Watsons Bond:Link model. The current discount rate is determined by reference to the Bond:Link interest rate model based upon a portfolio of highly rated U.S.
corporate bonds with individual bonds that are theoretically purchased to settle the plans anticipated cash outflows. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys Canadian benefit obligations was developed by using the plans bond portfolio indices, which match the benefit obligations. 
The fluctuations in stock and bond markets could cause actual investment results to be significantly different from those assumed, and therefore, significantly impact the valuation of the assets in our pension trust. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the 2011 benefit obligations related to the Companys pension and postretirement plans were 4.16 percent and 4.00 percent, respectively. A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average discount rate would have increased the accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans at January 28, 2012 by approximately $32 million, and would have increased the accumulated benefit
obligation on the postretirement plan by approximately $1 million. Such a decrease would not have significantly changed 2011 pension expense or postretirement income. 
The Company maintains two postretirement medical plans, one covering executive officers and certain key employees of the Company, (SERP Medical Plan), and the other covering all other associates. With respect to the SERP Medical Plan, a one percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would change this plans accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $2 million. With respect to the postretirement medical plan covering all other associates, there is limited risk to the Company for increases in health care costs since, beginning in 2001, new retirees have assumed the full expected costs and then-existing retirees have
assumed all increases in such costs. 
The Company expects to record postretirement income of approximately $4 million and pension expense of approximately $17 million in 2012. 
Income Taxes 
In accordance with GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdiction and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon the Companys strategic long-range plans. A one percent change in the Companys overall statutory tax rate for 2011
would have resulted in a $7 million change in the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether the tax rate change was a decrease or an increase. 
The Company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these estimates. 
The Company expects its 2012 effective tax rate to approximate 37 percent. The actual rate will vary depending primarily on the percentage of the Companys income earned in the United States as compared with its international operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, that is effective in 2012. The revised standard is intended to reduce cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. We do not believe that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Foot Locker, Inc.: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 28, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 28, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Foot Locker, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 26, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Foot Locker, Inc. and its domestic and international subsidiaries (the Company), all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may
differ from those estimates. 
Reporting Year 
The reporting period for the Company is the Saturday closest to the last day in January. Fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 represent the 52 week periods ending January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively. References to years in this annual report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue from retail stores is recognized at the point of sale when the product is delivered to customers. Internet and catalog sales revenue is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer. Sales include shipping and handling fees for all periods presented. Sales include merchandise, net of returns, and exclude taxes. The Company provides for estimated returns based on return history and sales levels. Revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer receives the product, rather than when the initial deposit is paid. 
Gift Cards 
The Company sells gift cards to its customers, which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift cards are redeemed or when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions, referred to as breakage. The Company has determined its gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns. Historical experience indicates that after 12 months the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote. Gift card breakage income is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses and totaled $4 million, $2 million, and $4 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a current liability. 
Statement of Cash Flows 
The Company has selected to present the operations of the discontinued businesses as one line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For all the periods presented this caption includes only operating activities. 
Store Pre-Opening and Closing Costs 
Store pre-opening costs are charged to expense as incurred. In the event a store is closed before its lease has expired, the estimated post-closing lease exit costs, less the sublease rental income, is provided for once the store ceases to be used. 
Advertising Costs and Sales Promotion 
Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed at the time the advertising or promotion takes place, net of reimbursements for cooperative advertising. Advertising expenses also include advertising costs as required by some of the Companys mall-based leases. Cooperative advertising reimbursements earned for the launch and promotion of certain products agreed upon with vendors is recorded in the same period as the associated expenses are incurred.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)
Reimbursement received in excess of expenses incurred related to specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs, is accounted for as a reduction to the cost of merchandise, which is reflected in cost of sales as the merchandise is sold. 
Advertising costs, which are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses, were as follows:

Cooperative reimbursements earned for the promotion of certain products are agreed upon with vendors and are recorded in the same period as the associated catalog expenses are amortized. Prepaid catalog costs totaled $3 million and $4 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. 
Catalog costs, which are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses, were as follows:

Earnings Per Share 
The Company accounts for and discloses earnings per share using the treasury stock method. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing reported net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Restricted stock awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, are considered participating securities and are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic earnings per share computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation
of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)
Potential common shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units. Options to purchase 3.8 million, 4.5 million, and 6.3 million shares of common stock at January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively, were not included in the computations because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. Contingently issuable shares of 0.9 million have not been included as the vesting conditions have not been satisfied. 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards. See Note 21, Share-Based Compensation, for information on the assumptions the Company used to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation. 
Upon exercise of stock options, issuance of restricted stock or units, or issuance of shares under the employees stock purchase plan, the Company will issue authorized but unissued common stock or use common stock held in treasury. The Company may make repurchases of its common stock from time to time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions, market conditions, and other factors. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash equivalents at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 were $830 million and $675 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are $191 million and $165 million of short-term deposits as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including commercial paper and money market funds, to be cash equivalents. Additionally, amounts due from third party credit card processors for the settlement of debit and credit card transactions are included as cash equivalents as they are generally collected within three business days. 
Investments 
Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and are not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations until a sale transaction occurs or when declines in fair value are deemed to be other-than-temporary. The Company routinely reviews available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a security may not be recoverable, the security is written down to fair value. The Companys
auction rate security was valued at $5 million for both January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. See Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of these investments. 
Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales 
Merchandise inventories for the Companys Athletic Stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Cost for retail stores is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis for domestic inventories and on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis for international inventories. The retail inventory method is commonly used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail
percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. The Company provides reserves based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. Merchandise inventories of the Direct-to-Customers business are valued at the lower of cost or market using weighted-average cost, which approximates FIFO. Transportation, distribution center, and sourcing costs are capitalized in merchandise inventories. The Company expenses the freight associated with transfers between its store locations in the period incurred. The Company maintains an accrual for shrinkage based on historical rates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)
Cost of sales is comprised of the cost of merchandise, occupancy, buyers compensation, and shipping and handling costs. The cost of merchandise is recorded net of amounts received from vendors for damaged product returns, markdown allowances, and volume rebates, as well as cooperative advertising reimbursements received in excess of specific, incremental advertising expenses. Occupancy includes the amortization of amounts received from landlords for tenant improvements. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Owned property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets: maximum of 50 years for buildings and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Property and equipment under capital leases and improvements to leased premises are
generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. Capitalized software reflects certain costs related to software developed for internal use that are capitalized and amortized. After substantial completion of a project, the costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 2 to 7 year period. Capitalized software, net of accumulated amortization, is included as a component of property and equipment and was $27 million at both January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. 
Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company recognizes impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. Managements policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists, a triggering event, comprises measurable operating performance criteria at the division level, as well as qualitative measures. The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results, which are predominately identified from the Companys strategic long-range plans, in its evaluation of potential store-level impairment and then compares the
carrying amount of the asset with the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the Companys weighted-average cost of capital. The Company estimates fair value based on the best information available using estimates, judgments, and projections as considered necessary. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
The Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the first quarter of its fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a combination of market and discounted cash flow approaches. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. For derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as part of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income/loss or as a basis adjustment to the underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally not reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed of. 

42

 
 

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)
To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in earnings immediately, which may subject the Company to increased earnings volatility. 
Fair Value 
The Company categorizes its financial instruments into a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs. 
The Companys financial assets recorded at fair value are categorized as follows: 
Level 1  Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets. 
Level 3  Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. 
Income Taxes 
The Company determines its deferred tax provision under the liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using presently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 
A taxing authority may challenge positions that the Company adopted in its income tax filings. Accordingly, the Company may apply different tax treatments for transactions in filing its income tax returns than for income tax financial reporting. The Company regularly assesses its tax positions for such transactions and records reserves for those differences when considered necessary. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Provision for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made only on those amounts in excess of the funds considered to be permanently reinvested.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)
Pension and Postretirement Obligations 
In 2011, the Company changed how the discount rate was selected to measure the present value of U.S. benefit obligations from the Citibank Pension Discount curve to Towers Watsons Bond:Link model. The current discount rate is determined by reference to the Bond:Link interest rate model based upon a portfolio of highly rated U.S. corporate bonds with individual bonds that are theoretically purchased to settle the plans anticipated cash outflows. The cash flows are discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys Canadian benefit
obligations was developed by using the plans bond portfolio indices, which match the benefit obligations. 
Insurance Liabilities 
The Company is primarily self-insured for health care, workers compensation, and general liability costs. Accordingly, provisions are made for the Companys actuarially determined estimates of discounted future claim costs for such risks, for the aggregate of claims reported and claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insured liabilities totaled $14 million and $15 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. The Company discounts its workers compensation and general liability reserves using a risk-free interest rate. Imputed interest expense related to these liabilities was not significant for 2011, 2010, and
2009. 
Accounting for Leases 
The Company recognizes rent expense for operating leases as of the possession date for store leases or the commencement of the agreement for a non-store lease. Rental expense, inclusive of rent holidays, concessions, and tenant allowances are recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Contingent payments based upon sales and future increases determined by inflation related indices cannot be estimated at the inception of the lease and accordingly, are charged to operations as incurred. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency of the Companys international operations is the applicable local currency. The translation of the applicable foreign currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The unearned gains and losses resulting from such translation are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, that is effective in 2012. The revised standard is intended to reduce cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. We do not believe that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.

2.  Segment Information 
The Company has determined that its reportable segments are those that are based on its method of internal reporting. As of January 28, 2012, the Company has two reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers. The accounting policies of both segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note. The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is division results. Division profit reflects income from continuing operations before income taxes, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

Impairment of Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. During the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that triggering events had occurred related to its CCS intangible assets, which is part of the Direct-to-Customers segment, reflecting decreases in projected revenues. Accordingly, a charge of $5 million and $10 million was recorded to write-down the
CCS tradename for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value was determined using an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method.

FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
3.  Impairment and Other Charges   (continued)
Impairment of Assets 
No impairment charges related to long-lived assets were recorded during 2011 or 2010. During 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $36 million; $32 million was recorded to write-down long-lived assets at its Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions, and a $4 million charge was recorded to write off certain software development costs for the Direct-to-Customers segment as a result of managements decision to terminate the project. 
Reorganization Costs 
In 2009, the Company consolidated the management team of the Lady Foot Locker business with the team that managed the Foot Locker U.S., Kids Foot Locker, and Footaction businesses. As a result of this divisional reorganization, as well as certain corporate staff reductions taken to improve corporate efficiency, the Company recorded a charge of $5 million. This charge was comprised primarily of severance costs to eliminate approximately 120 positions. 
4.  Other Income 
Other income reflects non-operating income and includes items such as royalty income from the Companys franchising agreements, lease termination gains, realized gains/losses and premiums associated with foreign currency option contracts, gains on the purchase and retirement of bonds, and other non-operating items. Other income was $4 million in both 2011 and 2010 and was $3 million in 2009. 
For 2011, other income primarily includes $2 million of lease termination gains related to the sales of leasehold interests, $1 million for insurance recoveries, as well as royalty income. For 2010, other income includes a $2 million gain on its money-market investment, as well as royalty income, and gains on lease terminations related to certain lease interests in Europe. Other income in 2009 primarily reflects $4 million related to gains from insurance recoveries, gains on the purchase and retirement of bonds, and royalty income, partially offset by foreign currency option contract premiums of $1 million.

(1)
Includes the effect of foreign currency translation related primarily to the movements of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the amounts presented for each of the periods reflects accumulated impairment charges of $2 million. 





(2)
The weighted-average useful life disclosed excludes those assets that are fully amortized. 





(3)
The net value of the CCS tradename at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 includes impairment charges of $5 million and $10 million, respectively, as described more fully in Note 3. 


Amortizing intangible assets primarily represent lease acquisition costs, which are amounts that are required to secure prime lease locations and other lease rights, primarily in Europe. During 2011, additions of $7 million were recorded primarily from new leases in Europe. Retirements recorded during 2011 were $3 million. Amortization expense for intangibles subject to amortization was $16 million, $17 million, and $19 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Estimated future amortization expense for finite lived intangibles for the next five years is as follows:

12.  Revolving Credit Facility 
On January 27, 2012, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement) with its banks, replacing the 2009 Credit Agreement. The 2011 Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million asset based revolving credit facility maturing on January 27, 2017. In addition, during the term of the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement, the Company may make up to four requests for additional credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million. Interest is based on the LIBOR rate in effect at the time of the borrowing plus a 1.25 to 1.50 percent margin depending on certain provisions as
defined in the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement.

FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
12.  Revolving Credit Facility   (continued)
The 2011 Restated Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of the Companys domestic assets, including certain inventory assets, but excluding intellectual property. The Company is not required to comply with any financial covenants as long as there are no outstanding borrowings. With regard to the payment of dividends and share repurchases, there are no restrictions if the Company is not borrowing and the payments are funded through cash on hand. If the Company is borrowing, Availability as of the end of each fiscal month during the subsequent projected six fiscal months following the payment must be at least 20 percent of
the lesser of the Aggregate Commitments and the Borrowing Base (as defined in the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement). The Companys management does not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2012. 
At January 28, 2012, the Company had unused domestic lines of credit of $199 million, while $1 million was committed to support standby letters of credit. The letters of credit are primarily used for insurance programs. 
Deferred financing fees are amortized over the life of the facility on a straight-line basis, which is comparable to the interest method. The unamortized balance at January 28, 2012 is $3 million. 
The quarterly facility fees paid on the unused portion were 0.75 percent for both 2011 and 2010. Under the terms of the 2011 Restated Credit Agreement, the quarterly facility fee will be 0.25 percent on the unused portion. There were no short-term borrowings during 2011 or 2010. Interest expense, including facility fees, related to the revolving credit facility was $4 million, $4 million, and $3 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
13.  Long-Term Debt 
The Companys long-term debt reflects the Companys 8.50 percent debentures payable in 2022, and was $135 million and $137 million for the years ended January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. Excluding the unamortized gain of the interest rate swaps of $15 million, the principal outstanding is $120 million. The gain is being amortized as part of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt, using the effective-yield method. 
Interest expense related to long-term debt, including the effect of the interest rate swaps and the amortization of the associated debt issuance costs, was $9 million for all years presented.

15.  Leases 
The Company is obligated under operating leases for almost all of its store properties. Some of the store leases contain renewal options with varying terms and conditions. Management expects that in the normal course of business, expiring leases will generally be renewed or, upon making a decision to relocate, replaced by leases on other premises. Operating lease periods generally range from 5 to 10 years. Certain leases provide for additional rent payments based on a percentage of store sales. Most of the Companys leases require the payment of certain executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and other costs in addition to the future
minimum lease payments. These costs, including the amortization of lease rights, totaled $130 million, $131 million, and $138 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Included in the amounts below, are non-store expenses that totaled $17 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010 and 2009.

Provision has been made in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for additional income taxes applicable to dividends received or expected to be received from international subsidiaries. The amount of unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries for which no such tax is provided and which is considered to be permanently reinvested in the subsidiaries totaled $771 million and $679 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. The determination of the amount of the deferred tax liability related to permanently reinvested earnings is not practicable.

The Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit. Audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve. A taxing authority may challenge positions that the Company has adopted in its income tax filings. Accordingly, the Company may apply different tax treatments for transactions in filing its income tax returns than for income tax financial reporting. The Company regularly assesses its tax positions for such transactions and records reserves for those differences. 
The Companys U.S. Federal income tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service through 2010. The Company is participating in the IRSs Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) for 2011, which is expected to conclude during 2012. The Company has started the CAP for 2012. Due to the recent utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Company is subject to state and local tax examinations effectively including years from 1996 to the present. To date, no adjustments have been proposed in any audits that will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 
As of January 28, 2012, the Company has a valuation allowance of $5 million to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets arising from a capital loss associated with the 2008 impairment of the Northern Group note receivable, state tax loss carryforwards, and state tax credits. A full valuation allowance is required for the capital loss because the Company does not anticipate realizing capital gains to utilize this loss. The valuation allowance for state tax loss and credit carryforwards decreased in 2011 principally due to anticipated
expirations of those attributes.

17.  Income Taxes   (continued)
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, which are based upon the Companys strategic long-range plans, over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances at January 28, 2012. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised. 
At January 28, 2012, the Company has state operating loss carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $11 million that expire between 2012 and 2030. The Company will have, when realized, a capital loss with a potential benefit of $3 million arising from a note receivable. This loss will carryforward for 5 years after realization. The Company has U.S. state and Canadian provincial credit carryforwards that total $2 million, expiring between 2012 and 2021. The Company has international operating loss carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $2 million, expiring between 2012 and 2031. 
At January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, the Company had $65 million and $62 million, respectively of gross unrecognized tax benefits, and $64 million and $61 million, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits that would, if recognized, affect the Companys annual effective tax rate. The Company has classified certain income tax liabilities as current or noncurrent based on managements estimate of when these liabilities will be settled. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized $1 million of interest expense in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009. The
total amount of accrued interest and penalties was $4 million, $3 million, and $5 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:

It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of foreign currency fluctuations, ongoing audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations. Settlements could increase earnings in an amount ranging from $0 to $5 million based on current estimates. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues, the ultimate resolution of these issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of
the Company. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, generating a positive effect on earnings. Due to the uncertainty of amounts and in accordance with its accounting policies, the Company has not recorded any potential impact of these settlements.

FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
18.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management 
The Company operates internationally and utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate its foreign currency exposures, primarily related to third party and intercompany forecasted transactions. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of entering into contracts only with major financial institutions selected based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties throughout the duration of the
derivative instrument. Additional information is contained within Note 19, Fair Value Measurements. 
Derivative Holdings Designated as Hedges 
For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature of the hedged items and the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and the methods of assessing hedge effectiveness and hedge ineffectiveness. In addition, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If it were deemed
probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings immediately. No such gains or losses were recognized in earnings for any of the periods presented. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period, which management evaluates periodically. 
The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed are the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. For option and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of the purchase of inventory, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. The amount reclassified to cost of sales related to such contracts was not significant for any of the periods presented. The ineffective portion of gains and losses related to cash flow hedges recorded to
earnings was also not significant for any of the periods presented. When using a forward contract as a hedging instrument, the Company excludes the time value from the assessment of effectiveness. The Company had not hedged forecasted transactions for more than the next twelve months, and the Company expects all derivative-related amounts reported in AOCL to be reclassified to earnings within twelve months. During 2011, the net changes in the fair value of the contracts resulted in a loss of $2 million and therefore increased AOCL for the year ended January 28, 2012. 
Derivative Holdings Designated as Non-Hedges 
The Company mitigates the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on the reporting of foreign-currency denominated earnings by entering into currency option contracts. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts, which are designated as non-hedges, are recorded in earnings immediately within other income. The realized gains, premiums paid and changes in the fair market value recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for any of the periods presented. 
The Company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign-currency denominated merchandise purchases and intercompany transactions that are not designated as hedges. Net changes in the fair value of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments designated as non-hedges were substantially offset by the changes in value of the underlying transactions, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The amounts recorded for all the periods presented were not significant.

The Company enters into diesel fuel forward and option contracts to mitigate a portion of the Companys freight expense due to the variability caused by fuel surcharges imposed by our third-party freight carriers.

Business Risk 
The retailing business is highly competitive. Price, quality, selection of merchandise, reputation, store location, advertising, and customer service are important competitive factors in the Companys business. The Company operates in 23 countries and purchased approximately 82 percent of its merchandise in 2011 from its top 5 vendors. In 2011, the Company purchased approximately 61 percent of its athletic merchandise from one major vendor, Nike, Inc. (Nike), and approximately 17 percent from another major vendor. Each of our operating divisions is highly dependent on Nike; they individually purchase 45 to 77 percent of their
merchandise from Nike. The Company generally considers all vendor relations to be satisfactory. 
Included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 28, 2012, are the net assets of the Companys European operations, which total $794 million and which are located in 19 countries, 11 of which have adopted the euro as their functional currency.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are valued using observable market-based inputs to industry valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility obtained from various market sources. 
At January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, the Company held a preferred stock auction rate security with a face value of $7 million. The security earns and pays interest based on the stated terms. The Company classifies the security as long-term available-for-sale and reports the security at fair value as a component of other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the security for other-than-temporary impairments at each reporting period. The security is considered temporarily impaired at January 28, 2012 with a cumulative unrealized loss of $2 million reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the
Companys Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. The Company has the intent and the ability to hold the security. 
The following table provides a summary of recognized assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note 3, Impairment and Other Charges, for further discussion and additional disclosures.

20.  Retirement Plans and Other Benefits 
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans 
The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its North American employees, which are funded in accordance with the provisions of the laws where the plans are in effect. In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company sponsors postretirement medical and life insurance plans, which are available to most of its retired U.S. employees. These plans are contributory and are not funded. The measurement date of the assets and liabilities is the last day of the fiscal year. The following tables set forth the plans changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, funded status, and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance

20.  Retirement Plans and Other Benefits   (continued)
Pension expense is actuarially calculated annually based on data available at the beginning of each year. The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected long-term rate of return on assets by the market-related value of plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plan and market value for the Canadian qualified pension plan. The market-related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over three or five years, depending on which computation results in a market-related value closer to market value. Market-related value for the U.S. qualified plan
was $476 million and $493 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Assumptions used in the calculation of net benefit cost include the discount rate selected and disclosed at the end of the previous year as well as other assumptions detailed in the table below:

The expected long-term rate of return on invested plan assets is based on the plans weighted-average target asset allocation, as well as historical and future expected performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is selected to obtain an investment return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce future contributions by the Company.

Beginning with 2001, new retirees were charged the expected full cost of the medical plan and then-existing retirees will incur 100 percent of the expected future increases in medical plan costs. Any changes in the health care cost trend rates assumed would not affect the accumulated benefit obligation or net benefit income, since retirees will incur 100 percent of such expected future increase.

In addition, the Company maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which is an unfunded plan that includes provisions for the continuation of medical and dental insurance benefits to certain executive officers and certain other key employees of the Company (SERP Medical Plan). The SERP Medical Plans accumulated projected benefit obligation at January 28, 2012 was approximately $9 million. The assumed health care cost trend rates related to the measurement of the Companys SERP Medical Plan obligations for the year ended January 28, 2012 are as follows:

Plan Assets 
During 2011, the target composition of the Companys U.S. plan assets was changed to represent 45 percent equity and 55 percent fixed-income securities. The Company may alter the targets from time to time depending on market conditions and the funding requirements of the pension plan. This current asset allocation will limit volatility with regard to the funded status of the plan, but will result in higher pension expense due to the lower long-term rate of return associated with fixed-income securities. Due to market conditions and other factors, actual asset allocations may vary from the target allocation outlined above. The Company believes
that plan assets are invested in a prudent manner with an objective of providing a total return that, over the long term, provides sufficient assets to fund benefit obligations, taking into account the Companys expected contributions and the level of risk deemed appropriate. The Companys investment strategy seeks to utilize asset classes with differing rates of return, volatility, and correlation in order to reduce risk by providing diversification relative to equities. Diversification within asset classes is also utilized to ensure that there are no significant concentrations of risk in plan assets and to reduce the effect that the return on any single investment may have on the entire portfolio. 
The target composition of the Companys Canadian plan assets is 95 percent debt securities and 5 percent equity. The Company believes that plan assets are invested in a prudent manner with the same overall objective and investment strategy as noted above for the U.S. pension plan. The bond portfolio is comprised of government and corporate bonds chosen to match the duration of the pension plans benefit payment obligations. This current asset allocation will limit future volatility with regard to the funded status of the plan. This allocation has resulted in higher pension expense due to the lower long-term rate of return associated with
fixed-income securities. 
Valuation of Investments 
Significant portions of plan assets are invested in commingled trust funds. These funds are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year end. Stocks traded on U.S. security exchanges are valued at closing market prices on the measurement date.

Investments in real estate are carried at their estimated fair value based on information supplied by independent appraisers whereby each property is independently appraised and adjusted accordingly at least once within a five-year period. The Companys management reviews the fair value of each property during the intervening years to determine whether an impairment has occurred since receiving the latest independent appraisal and that no change is required to the fair value.

In February 2007, the Company and its U.S. pension plan, the Foot Locker Retirement Plan, were named as defendants in a class action in federal court in New York. The Complaint alleged that the Companys pension plan violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including, without limitation, its age discrimination and notice provisions, as a result of the Companys conversion of its defined benefit plan to a defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature in 1996. The Company is defending the action vigorously. The Company is currently unable to make an estimate of loss or range of loss. Management does not believe
that the outcome of any such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole.

20.  Retirement Plans and Other Benefits   (continued)
Savings Plans 
The Company has two qualified savings plans, a 401(k) Plan that is available to employees whose primary place of employment is the U.S., and an 1165(e) Plan that is available to employees whose primary place of employment is in Puerto Rico. Both plans require that the employees have attained at least the age of twenty-one and have completed one year of service consisting of at least 1,000 hours. As of January 1, 2012, the savings plans allow eligible employees to contribute up to 40 percent and $10,000, for the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, respectively, of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company matches 25 percent of the first 4 percent of
the employees contributions with Company stock and such matching Company contributions are vested incrementally over 5 years for both plans. The charge to operations for the Companys matching contribution was $2 million in each of 2011 and 2010 and $3 million in 2009. 
21.  Share-Based Compensation 
Stock Awards 
Under the Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Stock Plan), stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights (SARs), or other stock-based awards may be granted to officers and other employees of the Company, including its subsidiaries and operating divisions worldwide. Nonemployee directors are also eligible to receive awards under this plan. Options for employees become exercisable in substantially equal annual installments over a three-year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant of the option, unless a shorter or longer duration is established at the time of the
option grant. Options for nonemployee directors become exercisable one year from the date of grant. On May 19, 2010, the 2007 Stock Plan was amended to increase the maximum number of shares of stock reserved for all awards to 12,000,000. The options terminate up to ten years from the date of grant. 
Employees Stock Purchase Plan 
Under the Companys 2003 Employees Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), participating employees are able to contribute up to 10 percent of their annual compensation, not to exceed $25,000 in any plan year, through payroll deductions to acquire shares of the Companys common stock at 85 percent of the lower market price on one of two specified dates in each plan year. Under the ESPP, 3,000,000 shares of common stock are authorized for purchase beginning June 2005. Of the 3,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for purchase under this plan, 919 participating employees purchased 336,116 shares in 2011, and 764 participating employees
purchased 278,212 shares in 2010. To date, a total of 1,278,045 shares have been purchased under this plan. 
Share-Based Compensation Expense 
Total compensation expense related to the Companys share-based compensation plans was $18 million, $13 million, and $12 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The total related tax benefit realized was $5 million, $3 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively and was not significant for 2009. 
Valuation Model and Assumptions 
The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. 

65

 
 

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
21.  Share-Based Compensation   (continued)
The Company estimates the expected term of share-based awards granted using the Companys historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination patterns, which it believes are representative of future behavior. The expected term for the employee stock purchase plan valuation is based on the length of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the offering period, which is one year. The Company estimates the expected volatility of its common stock at the grant date using a weighted-average of the Companys historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys common stock. The Company believes
that the combination of historical volatility and implied volatility provides a better estimate of future stock price volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected dividend yield is derived from the Companys historical experience. The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on its historical pre-vesting forfeiture data. The Company estimates pre-vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and periodically revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
The following table shows the Companys assumptions used to compute the share-based compensation expense:

Restricted Stock and Units 
Restricted shares of the Companys common stock and restricted stock units may be awarded to certain officers and key employees of the Company. The Company also issues restricted stock units to its non-employee directors. Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Companys common stock provided that the vesting conditions are satisfied. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were 1,098,177, 653,535, and 227,000 restricted stock units outstanding, respectively. Compensation expense is recognized using the fair market value at the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period, provided the recipient continues
to be employed by the Company. 
Generally, awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years. However, restricted stock unit grants made after May 19, 2010 in connection with the Companys long-term incentive program vest after the attainment of certain performance metrics and the passage of time. Restricted stock is considered outstanding at the time of grant and the holders have voting rights. Dividends are paid to holders of restricted stock that vest with the passage of time; for performance-based restricted stock granted after May 19, 2010, dividends will be accumulated and paid after the performance criteria are met.

22.  Legal Proceedings 
Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or disposed of by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and labor-and-employment-related claims. 
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under federal or state wage and hour laws, including allegations concerning unpaid overtime, meal, and rest breaks, and uniforms. 
The Company is a defendant in one such case in which plaintiff alleges that the Company permitted unpaid off-the-clock hours in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws. The case, Pereira v. Foot Locker, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2007. In his complaint, in addition to unpaid wage and overtime allegations, plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees and costs. In 2009, the Court conditionally certified a nationwide collective action. During the course of 2010, notices were sent to approximately 81,888 current and former
employees of the Company offering them the opportunity to participate in the class action, and approximately 5,027 have opted in. 
The Company is a defendant in additional purported wage and hour class actions that assert claims similar to those asserted in Pereira and seek similar remedies. With the exception of Hill v. Foot Locker filed in state court in Illinois in 2011, and Cortes v. Foot Locker filed in federal court of New York, all of these actions were consolidated by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation with Pereira. The consolidated cases are in the discovery stages of proceedings. In Hill v. Foot Locker, in May 2011, the court granted plaintiffs motion for certification of an opt-out class covering
certain Illinois employees only. The Companys motion for leave to appeal was denied. The Company is currently engaged in mediation with plaintiff in Pereira and his counsel in an attempt to determine whether it will be possible to resolve the consolidated cases and Hill. Meanwhile, the Company is vigorously defending them. Due to the inherent uncertainties of such matters, including the early stages of certain matters, the Company is currently unable to make an estimate of the range of loss.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOOT LOCKER, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
22.  Legal Proceedings   (continued)
Management does not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Pereira consolidated cases and Hill as described above, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole. 
23.  Commitments 
In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, the Company may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, management believes that the resolution of such contingencies will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. The Company is also operating certain stores and making rental payments for which lease
agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that a lease will be executed. 
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business and disclosed above, or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities.

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 


There were no disagreements between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on matters of accounting principles or practices. 



Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures 





(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 


The Companys management performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of January 28, 2012. Based on that evaluation, the Companys CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to ensure that information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 



(b)
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 


The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). To evaluate the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, the Company uses the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework). Using the COSO Framework, the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the Companys internal control over financial reporting and concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2012. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the Companys effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 9A(d). 



(c)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 


During the Companys last fiscal quarter there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Foot Locker, Inc.: 
We have audited Foot Locker, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Foot Locker, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, Foot Locker, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2012, and January 29, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 28, 2012, and our report dated March 26, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on these consolidated financial statements.
