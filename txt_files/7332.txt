ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Southwestern Energy
Company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and oil
exploration, development and production (E&P). We are also focused on
creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and
marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services.  

Exploration and
Production - Our primary business is the exploration for and production of
natural gas and oil, with our current operations being principally focused
within the United States on development of an unconventional gas reservoir
located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which we refer to as the
Fayetteville Shale play.  We are also actively engaged in exploration and
production activities in Pennsylvania, where we are targeting the unconventional
gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and to a lesser extent in Texas and
in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin.  We also engage in
exploration activities in order to test new plays and recently commenced
exploration operations in Arkansas and Louisiana relating to an unconventional
horizontal oil play targeting the Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation (LSBD).
 In addition, in 2010, we commenced an exploration program for natural gas
and crude oil under 32 licenses in New Brunswick, Canada.  We conduct our
exploration and production operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
SEECO, Inc., or SEECO, and Southwestern Energy Production Company, or SEPCO.
SEECO operates exclusively in Arkansas where it holds a large base of both
developed and undeveloped gas reserves, and conducts the Fayetteville Shale
drilling program and the conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program in the
Arkoma Basin. SEPCO conducts development drilling and exploration programs in
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.  DeSoto Drilling,
Inc., or DDI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEPCO, operates drilling rigs in
Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, as well as our other operating areas.
 Our Canadian operations are conducted by our subsidiary, SWN Resources
Canada Inc.  

Midstream Services
- We engage in natural gas gathering activities in Arkansas, Texas and
Pennsylvania through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering Company,
L.L.C., which we refer to as DeSoto Gathering, and Angelina Gathering Company,
L.L.C., which we refer to as Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering and Angelina
Gathering primarily support our E&P operations and generate revenue from
gathering fees associated with the transportation of our and third party gas to
market. Our natural gas marketing subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Services
Company, or SES, captures downstream opportunities which arise through the
marketing and transportation of the natural gas produced in our E&P
operations.  

The vast majority of our
operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion
and amortization, or EBITDA, is derived from our E&P business.  In
2011, 77% of our operating income and 84% of our EBITDA were generated from our
E&P business, compared to 81% of our operating income and 86% of our EBITDA
in 2010, and 86% of our operating income and 90% of our EBITDA in 2009, absent
our $907.8 million, or $558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash ceiling test
impairment of our natural gas and oil properties.  In 2011, 23% of our
operating income and 16% of our EBITDA were generated from Midstream Services,
compared to 19% of our operating income and 14% of our EBITDA in 2010, and 14%
of our operating income and 10% of our EBITDA in 2009, absent the non-cash
ceiling test impairment of our natural gas and oil properties.  EBITDA is a
non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to Business  Other Items  Reconciliation
of Non-GAAP Measures in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a table that
reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy.
  

Our Business
Strategy
Since 1999, our management has been guided by our formula, which
represents the essence of our corporate philosophy and how we operate our
business:

Our formula, which stands for The Right People doing the Right
Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create
Value+, also guides our business strategy.  We are focused on providing
long-term growth in the net asset value of our business.  In our E&P
business, we prepare an economic analysis for each investment opportunity based
upon the expected present value added for each dollar to be invested, which we
refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI.  The PVI of the future expected
cash flows for each project is determined using a 10% discount rate.  We
target creating at least $1.30 of discounted pre-tax PVI for each dollar we
invest in our E&P projects.  Our actual PVI results are utilized to
help determine the allocation of our future capital investments.  The key
elements of our business strategy are:

·
Exploit and Develop Our Positions in the Fayetteville Shale and
the Marcellus Shale.  Our primary focus is to maximize the value of our
significant acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play, which has provided
significant production and reserve growth since we began drilling in the play in
2004. At December 31, 2011, we held approximately 925,842 net acres in the
Fayetteville Shale play and the area accounted for approximately 87% of our
total proved oil and natural gas reserves and approximately 87% of our total oil
and natural gas production during 2011.  Additionally, we are actively
drilling on portions of our 186,893 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and believe
our production and reserves from this play will grow substantially over the next
few years.  We intend to further develop our acreage positions in the
Fayetteville Shale and the Marcellus Shale and improve our well results through
the use of advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of our
properties.  
·
Grow through New Exploration and Development Activities
Focusing on Emerging Unconventional Plays.  We actively seek to find
and develop new oil and natural gas plays with significant exploration and
exploitation potential, which we refer to as New Ventures. Our New Ventures
prospects are evaluated based on repeatability, multi-well potential and land
availability as well as other criteria, and can be located both inside and
outside of the United States.  As of December 31, 2011, we held 3,600,314
net undeveloped acres in connection with our New Ventures prospects, including
2,518,518 net acres in New Brunswick and 520,619 net undeveloped acres in the
LSBD formation in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana.  
·
Maximize Efficiency through Vertical Integration and Economies
of Scale.  In our key operating areas, the concentration of our
properties allows us to achieve economies of scale that result in lower
costs.  We seek to serve as the operator of the wells in which we have
a significant interest. As the operator, we are better positioned to control the
enhancing, drilling, completing and producing of wells and the marketing of
production to minimize costs and maximize both production volumes and realized
price.  In our Fayetteville Shale play, we have achieved significant cost
savings by operating a fleet of drilling rigs designed specifically for the play
and from our other associated oilfield services including our sand mine that is
a source of proppant for our well completions.  During 2012, we plan
to commence providing pressure pumping services for certain of our operated well
completions.  
·
Enhancing the Value of Our Midstream Operations.
 We have continued to design and improve our gas gathering
infrastructure to better manage the physical movement of our production and the
costs of our operations.  As of December 31, 2011, we have invested
approximately $933.0 million in the 1,791 mile gas gathering system built for
our Fayetteville Shale play, which was gathering approximately 2.1 Bcf per day
at year-end, and have invested approximately $44.2 million in 38 miles of gas
gathering lines in East Texas and Pennsylvania.  Our gathering system for
the Fayetteville Shale play has developed into a strategic asset that not only
supports our E&P operations but also will increase our overall returns on a
standalone basis.
Recent Developments
2012 Planned Capital Investments and Production Guidance.
 Our planned capital investment program for 2012 is approximately $2.1
billion, which includes approximately $1.8 billion for our E&P segment, $190
million for our Midstream Services segment and $90 million for corporate and
other purposes.  Our 2012 capital program is expected to be primarily
funded by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our $1.5 billion
revolving credit facility.  The planned capital program for 2012 is
flexible and we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into
account prevailing market conditions. Based on our capital program, we also
announced our targeted 2012 natural gas and oil production of approximately 560
to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 13% over our 2011 production, using
midpoints.
Exploration and
Production
Overview
Our operations are
primarily focused on the Fayetteville Shale, an unconventional reservoir located
in the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas.  In addition to our Arkansas operations,
we are also continuing to expand our drilling program on our acreage in
Pennsylvania targeting the Marcellus Shale and we will conduct both conventional
and unconventional operations targeting various formations as part of our New
Ventures projects, which include the recently announced unconventional
horizontal oil plays targeting the Brown Dense formation in Arkansas and
Louisiana, and exploration activities in New Brunswick, Canada.  We
continue to actively seek to develop both conventional and unconventional
natural gas and oil resource plays with significant exploration and exploitation
potential.

Our E&P segment
recorded operating income of $825.1 million in 2011. Our E&P segment
recorded operating income of $829.5 million in 2010 and an operating loss of
$157.7 million in 2009 as a result of the recognition of a $907.8 million, or
$558.3 million net of taxes, non-cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas
and oil properties recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2009.  The
slight decrease in operating income in 2011 was primarily due to lower prices
realized from the sale of our natural gas production and an increase in
operating costs and expenses which was largely offset by a 24% increase in our
total natural gas and oil production. The increase in operating income in 2010
was primarily due to a 35% increase in our total natural gas and oil production
which was partially offset by lower prices realized from the sale of our natural
gas production and an increase in operating costs and expenses. EBITDA from
our E&P segment was $1.5 billion in 2011, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010
and $1.2 billion in 2009. The increase in our EBITDA in 2011 was due to our
increased production volumes which was partially offset by lower prices realized
from the sale of our natural gas production and increased operating costs and
expenses.  The increase in our EBITDA in 2010 was due to our increased
production volumes which was partially offset by lower prices realized from the
sale of our natural gas production and increased operating costs and expenses.
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to Business  Other Items 
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy. 

Our Proved Reserves

Our estimated proved
natural gas and oil reserves were 5,893 Bcfe at year-end 2011, compared to 4,937
Bcfe at year-end 2010 and 3,657 Bcfe at year-end 2009. The overall increase
in total estimated proved reserves in the past three years is primarily due to
the development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas, with the development
of the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania also contributing in 2011.  The
average prices utilized to value our estimated proved natural gas and oil
reserves at December 31, 2011 were $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $92.71
per barrel for oil compared to $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $75.96 per
barrel for oil at December 31, 2010 and $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas and
$57.65 per barrel for oil at December 31, 2009. 

The after-tax PV-10, or
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas
and oil reserve quantities, was $3.5 billion at year-end 2011, compared to $3.0
billion at year-end 2010 and $1.8 billion at year-end 2009.  The
increase in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2011 was primarily due to the increase
in our reserves, partially offset by a comparative decrease in average 2011
prices for natural gas from average 2010 prices. The increase in our after-tax
PV-10 value in 2010 was primarily due to the increase in our reserves and a
comparative increase in average 2010 prices for natural gas from average 2009
prices, partially offset by higher operating and future development costs.
 Our proved reserves are almost entirely natural gas and as such the
after-tax PV-10 measure is highly dependent upon the natural gas price used in
the after-tax PV-10 calculation. The reconciling difference in after-tax PV-10
and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2011 Proved
Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted
value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.  Our year-end
2011 estimated proved reserves had a present value of estimated future net cash
flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $4.8 billion, compared to $4.3
billion at year-end 2010 and $2.3 billion at year-end 2009.  

We believe that the
pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved
reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value.
 While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that
are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the
unique tax situation of each individual company.  We understand that
securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a companys
current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies
without regard to income taxes.  We refer you to Note 4 in the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure
of discounted future cash flows related to our proved gas and oil reserves, to
the risk factor Although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is
independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in Item
1A of Part I of this Form 10-K, and to Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Cautionary Statement about
Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and
estimated reserve data.

Approximately 100% of
our year-end 2011 and 2010 estimated proved reserves were natural gas and
55% were classified as proved developed, compared to 100% and 54%, respectively,
in 2009.  We operate approximately 96% of our reserves, based on the
pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve
life index approximated 11.8 years at year-end 2011.  Sales of natural
gas production accounted for nearly 100% of total operating revenues for this
segment in 2011, 99% in 2010 and 100% in 2009.
 
The following table
provides an overall and by category summary of our oil and natural gas reserves,
as of fiscal year-end 2011 based on average fiscal year prices, and our well
count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2011 and sets forth 2011 annual
information related to production and capital investments for each of our
operating areas:

nonrenewable natural resources intended to be upgraded into synthetic gas or
oil. Our proved reserves increased by 1,459.4 Bcfe as a result of our drilling
program and net upward revisions of 33.7 Bcfe in 2011.  Of the reserve
additions, 611.6 Bcfe were proved developed and 847.8 Bcfe were proved
undeveloped.  We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a
combination of methodologies in determining estimates of material properties,
including performance and test date analysis offset statistical analogy of
performance data, volumetric evaluation, including analysis of petrophysical
parameters (including porosity, net pay, fluid saturations (i.e., water, oil and
gas) and permeability) in combination with estimated reservoir parameters
(including reservoir temperature and pressure, formation depth and formation
volume factors), geological analysis, including structure and isopach maps and
seismic analysis, including review of 2-D and 3-D data to ascertain faults,
closure and other factors.

Pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure) is one measure of the value of
a companys proved reserves that we believe is used by securities analysts to
compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes.
 The reconciling difference in pre-tax PV-10 and the after-tax PV-10, or
standardized measure, is the discounted value of future income taxes on the
estimated cash flows from our proved oil and natural gas reserves.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

As of December 31, 2011, we had 2,633 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserves, none of which were proved undeveloped reserves that remain undeveloped
for five years or more after initially being disclosed by us.  During 2011,
we invested $509.3 million in connection with converting 403.3 Bcfe or 18% of
our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2010 into proved developed
reserves and added 847.8 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions, primarily
in the Fayetteville Shale play. Our 2011 proved undeveloped reserve additions
are expected to be developed and to begin to generate cash inflows over the next
five years.  At December 31, 2010, we had 2,243 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserves, none of which were proved undeveloped reserves that remained
undeveloped for five years or more after initially being disclosed by us.
 During 2010, we invested $312.4 million in connection with converting
213.1 Bcfe or 13% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009
into proved developed reserves and added 733.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped
reserve additions, primarily in the Fayetteville Shale play. 
The development of our proved undeveloped reserves will require us
to make significant additional investments.  We expect that the development
costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 2,633 Bcfe as of December 31, 2011
will require us to invest an additional $3.4 billion in order for those reserves
to be brought to production.  Our ability to make the necessary investments
to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our
control.  A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period of
time could result in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce,
leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows.  We refer you to the
risk factors A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices
would have a material adverse affect on us, We may have difficulty financing
our planned capital investments, which could adversely affect our growth and
Our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements
may adversely affect operations and limit our growth in Item 1A of Part I of
this Form 10-K and to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Our Reserve Replacement

The ability of an
E&P company to add new reserves to replace the reserves that are being
depleted by its current production volumes is viewed by many investors as an
indication of its long-term prospects.  The reserve replacement ratio,
which we discuss below, is an important analytical measure used within the
E&P industry by investors and peers to evaluate performance results.
 There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure as it does not
reflect the type of reserves or the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the
potential value of the reserve additions.  Our reserve replacement ratio,
including revisions, has averaged over 400% for the three year period ended
December 31, 2011, primarily driven by increases in the reserves associated with
our Fayetteville Shale play with the development of the Marcellus Shale play in
Pennsylvania also contributing in 2011. 

In 2011, we replaced
299% of our production volumes with an increase of 1,459.4 Bcfe of proved gas
and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward revisions of
33.7 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 611.6 Bcfe were proved developed and
847.8 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve revisions during 2011
were primarily due to 102.6 Bcf in upward revisions related to the improved
performance of wells in our Marcellus Shale play, partially offset by downward
performance revisions of 27.5 Bcfe and 18.2 Bcfe in our east Texas and
conventional Arkoma Basin operating areas, respectively.  We also had
downward performance revisions in our Fayetteville Shale play of 14.0 Bcfe.
 Additionally, our reserves decreased by 9.2 Bcfe due to a comparative
decrease in the average gas price for 2011 as compared to 2010.  In
addition, our reserves decreased by 37.3 Bcfe as a result of our sale of oil and
natural gas leases and wells in 2011.

Table of Contents

In 2010, we replaced
430% of our production volumes with an increase of 1,431.1 Bcfe of proved gas
and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward revisions of
309.6 Bcfe.  Of the reserve additions, 698.0 Bcfe were proved developed and
733.2 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve revisions during 2010
were primarily due to 266.7 Bcf in upward revisions related to the improved
performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play and positive reserve
revisions of 78.4 Bcfe due to a comparative increase in the average gas price
for 2010 as compared to 2009.  Additionally, we had net upward revisions of
2.7 Bcfe and 34.2 Bcf in our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin operating
areas, respectively.  Additionally, our reserves decreased by 55.4 Bcfe as
a result of our sale of oil and natural gas leases and wells in 2010.

In 2009, our reserve
replacement ratio was 592% with an increase of 1,685.2 Bcfe of proved natural
gas and oil reserves as a result of our drilling program and net upward
revisions of 92.9 Bcfe.  Of the 2009 reserve additions, 757.6 Bcfe were
proved developed and 927.5 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The upward reserve
revisions during 2009 were primarily due to 384.8 Bcf in upward revisions
related to the improved performance of wells in our Fayetteville Shale play,
partially offset by downward reserve revisions of 251.5 Bcf due to a comparative
decrease in the average gas price for 2009 as compared to year-end 2008.
 Additionally, we had downward performance revisions of 25.5 Bcfe and 15.1
Bcf in our East Texas and conventional Arkoma Basin operating areas,
respectively.

For the period ending
December 31, 2011, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio,
including revisions, was 416%. Our reserve replacement ratio for 2011, excluding
the effect of reserve revisions, was 292%, compared to 354% in 2010 and 561% in
2009. Excluding reserve revisions, our three-year average reserve replacement
ratio is 380%.

Since 2005, the
substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our
drilling program in the Fayetteville Shale play.  We expect our drilling
programs in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays to continue be the
primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to
add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control.  We
refer you to the risk factors Our drilling plans for the Fayetteville Shale and
Marcellus Shale plays are subject to change and Our exploration, development
and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may not be profitable or
achieve our targeted returns in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K and to
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of
Part II of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these factors and
other risks.

Our Operations

Fayetteville Shale Play

Our Fayetteville Shale
play is currently a primary focus of our E&P business. The Fayetteville
Shale is a Mississippian-age unconventional gas reservoir located on the
Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in thickness from 50 to 550 feet and
ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet.  The Barnett Shale found in
north Texas is an analogous reservoir.  At December 31, 2011, we held
leases for approximately 925,842 net acres in the play area (360,473 net
undeveloped acres, 440,313 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale
production, 123,442 net developed acres held by conventional production and the
remainder in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin), compared to
approximately 915,884 net acres at year-end 2010 and 888,695 net acres at
year-end 2009. 

Approximately 5,104 Bcf
of our reserves at year-end 2011 were attributable to our Fayetteville Shale
play, compared to approximately 4,345 Bcf at year-end 2010 and 3,117 Bcf at
year-end 2009.  Gross production from our operated wells in the
Fayetteville Shale play increased from approximately 1,635 MMcf per day at the
beginning of 2011 to approximately 1,947 MMcf per day by year-end.  Our net
production from the Fayetteville Shale play was 436.8 Bcf in 2011, compared to
350.2 Bcf in 2010 and 243.5 Bcf in 2009. In 2012, we estimate our production
from the Fayetteville Shale play will be in the range of 465 to 470 Bcf.

At year-end
2011, approximately 74% of our 597,482 total net leasehold acres in the
Fayetteville Shale was held by production, excluding our acreage in the
traditional Fairway and the federal acreage we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit.
 For more information about our acreage and well count, we refer you to
Properties in Item 2 of Part 1 of this Form 10-K.   Excluding our
acreage in the traditional Fairway, our acreage position was obtained at an
average cost of approximately $253 per acre and has an average royalty interest
of 15%.  In 2012, we will earn 2 sections or approximately 500
net acres, representing less than 1% of our drilling program.
  As of December 31, 2011, excluding our acreage in the traditional
Fairway and our federal acreage, the undeveloped portion of our acreage had an
average remaining lease term of 2 years.

 We refer you to the risk
factor If we fail to drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our
acreage, the initial lease terms could expire, which would result in the loss of
certain leasehold rights in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.  
As of December 31, 2011,
we had spud a total of 3,095 wells in the play since its commencement in 2004,
2,581 of which were operated by us and 514 of which were outside-operated wells.
 Of the wells spud, 650 were in 2011, 658 were in 2010 and 570 were in
2009.  Of the wells spud in 2011, 649 were designated as horizontal wells.
 At year-end 2011, 2,380 operated wells had been drilled and completed
overall, including 2,290 horizontal wells.  Of the 2,290 horizontal wells,
2,272 wells were fracture stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel
stimulation treatments, or a combination thereof.

Over the past several
years, we have seen continual improvement in our drilling practices in the
Fayetteville Shale play.  Our operated horizontal wells had an average
completed well cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length
of 4,836 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 8 days from re-entry
to re-entry in 2011.  This compares to an average completed operated well
cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,528 feet
and average time to drill to total depth of 11 days from re-entry to re-entry
during 2010.  In 2009, our average completed operated well cost was $2.9
million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,100 feet and
average time to drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry.
 The operated wells we placed on production during 2011 averaged initial
production rates of 3,330 Mcf per day, compared to average initial production
rates of 3,364 Mcf per day in 2010 and 3,478 Mcf per day in
2009.  The decrease in initial production rates in 2011 and 2010 are
primarily due to increased well density and locational differences in the mix of
wells.  During 2011, we placed 51 operated wells on production with initial
production rates that exceeded 5.0 MMcf per day, including 6 wells that exceeded
6.0 MMcf per day.

Beginning in late 2008
and continuing through 2011, we drilled a significant number of wells to test
tighter well spacing. At December 31, 2011, we had placed 1,123 wells on
production that have well spacing of 700 feet or less, representing
approximately 65-acre spacing or less. Early production performance from recent
well spacing tests suggests that there are areas of the field that may be
economically developed at tighter spacing depending on market conditions.

Our total proved net
reserves booked in the play at year-end 2011 were from a total of 4,376
locations, of which 2,735 were proved developed producing, 59 were proved
developed non-producing and 1,582 were proved undeveloped.  Of the 4,376
locations, 4,310 were horizontal. The average gross proved reserves for the
undeveloped wells included in our year-end 2011 and 2010 reserves was
approximately 2.4 Bcf per well, compared to 2.2 Bcf per well at year-end 2009.
 Total proved net gas reserves booked in the play in 2010 totaled
approximately 4,345 Bcf from a total of 3,682 locations, of which 2,120 were
proved developed producing, 36 were proved developed non-producing and 1,526
were proved undeveloped.  Total proved net gas reserves booked in the play
in 2009 totaled approximately 3,117 Bcf from a total of 2,675 locations, of
which 1,428 were proved developed producing, 97 were proved developed
non-producing and 1,150 were proved undeveloped.  If the Fayetteville Shale
play continues to be successfully developed, we expect a continued significant
level of proved reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play over the next few
years.

In 2011, we invested
approximately $1.3 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which included
approximately $1.2 billion to spud 650 wells, 580 of which we operated.  We
increased our reserves in the Fayetteville Shale play by 1,196 Bcf, which
included net downward reserve revisions of 15 Bcf due primarily to well
performance of 14 Bcf and downward price revisions of 1 Bcf.  Included in
our total capital investments in the play during 2011 was $132 million in
capitalized costs and other expenses and $10 million for acquisition of
properties.  In 2010, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which included $1.2 billion to spud 658 wells, $48
million for acquisition of properties, and $111 million in capitalized costs and
other expenses.  In 2009, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in our
Fayetteville Shale play, which included $1.1 billion to spud 570 wells, $40
million for acquisition of properties, $22 million for seismic and $106 million
in capitalized costs and other expenses.  At December 31, 2011, we had
acquired approximately 1,324 square miles of 3-D seismic data, which provides us
with seismic data on approximately 65% of our net acreage position in the
Fayetteville Shale, excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway portion of
the Arkoma Basin.

In 2012, we plan to
invest approximately $1.1 billion in our Fayetteville Shale play, which includes
participating in approximately 460 to 470 gross wells, 425 to 435 of which are
planned to be operated by us.  

We believe that our
Fayetteville Shale acreage continues to have significant development potential.
 Our strategy going forward is to increase our production through
development drilling, increase the amount of acreage we hold by production and
determine the economic viability of the undrilled portion of our acreage.
 Our drilling program with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play is
flexible and will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of
our horizontal drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and
economic fracture stimulation methods and well spacing, the extent to which we
can replicate the results of our most successful Fayetteville Shale wells in
other Fayetteville Shale acreage and the natural gas commodity price
environment.  As we continue to gather data about the

Fayetteville Shale, it is possible that
additional information may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine
that prospects in some portion of our acreage position should not be pursued at
all. We refer you to the risk factor Our drilling plans are subject to change
in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Marcellus Shale Play

We began leasing in
northeastern Pennsylvania in 2007 in an effort to gain a position in the
emerging Marcellus Shale play.  At December 31, 2011, we had approximately
186,893 net acres in Pennsylvania under which we believe the Marcellus Shale is
prospective (180,676 net undeveloped acres and 6,217 net developed acres held by
production), compared to approximately 173,009 net acres at year-end of 2010 and
149,317 net acres at year-end 2009.  The increase in our acreage during
2011 and 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of additional leasehold.
 Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2011 had an average
remaining lease term of 2 years, an average royalty interest of 13% and was
obtained at an average cost of approximately $1,077 per acre.  

As of year-end 2011, we had spud 70 wells, 23 of which were on
production and 67 of which were horizontal wells.  In 2011, we invested
approximately $332 million in the Marcellus Shale, which included approximately
$214 million to participate in 45 wells, of which 8 are on production and 37
were in progress at year-end.  Of these 45 wells, 18 were horizontal wells
located in our Greenzweig area in Bradford County and the remaining 27 wells
were located in our Price and Range Trust areas in Susquehanna
County.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had 22 operated
horizontal wells on production which had an average completed well cost of $6.4
million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,007 feet and an average
of 12 fracture stimulation stages.  Included in our total capital
investments in the play during 2011 was approximately $77 million for
acquisition of properties, $13 million for seismic and $29 million in
capitalized costs and other expenses.  In 2011, we began the year drilling
with one operated rig in Pennsylvania and ended the year with two operated
rigs.
Approximately 342 Bcf of
our total proved net reserves at year-end 2011 were attributable to the
Marcellus Shale.  The company had a total of 22 operated horizontal wells
and 1 operated vertical well which were on production at December 31, 2011,
resulting in net production from this area of 23.4 Bcf in 2011, compared to 1.0
Bcf in 2010.  Our reserves booked
in the Marcellus Shale included a total of 60 locations, of which 30 were proved
developed producing, 2 were proved developed non-producing and 28 were proved
undeveloped.  The average gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells
included in our year-end reserves was approximately 7.5 Bcf per well, up from
3.0 per well at year-end 2010.  In 2010, we invested approximately $118
million in the Marcellus Shale and participated in 21 wells, resulting in net
production of 1.0 Bcf and adding new reserves of 38 Bcf. In 2009, we invested
approximately $40 million in the Marcellus Shale, substantially all of which was
for the acquisition of properties. 
 
In 2012, we plan to
invest approximately $526 million.  We expect to end the year with four
operated rigs and participate in a total of 80 to 85 gross wells in 2012, all of
which will be operated by us. In 2012, we estimate our production from the
Marcellus Shale play will be in the range of 60 to 65 Bcf.  Our
ability to bring our Marcellus Shale production to market will depend on a
number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of
capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.  We refer
you to Midstream Services  Gas Marketing for a discussion of our gathering
and transportation arrangements for the Marcellus Shale production and to the
risk factor Our ability to sell our natural gas and oil and/or to receive
market prices for our production may be adversely affected by constraints or
interruptions on gathering systems, pipelines, processing and transportation
systems owned or operated by us or others. in Item 1A of Part I of this
Form 10-K.  

We believe that our
Marcellus Shale acreage has significant development potential. Our drilling
program with respect to our Marcellus Shale play is flexible and will be
impacted by a number of factors, including the results of our horizontal
drilling efforts, our ability to determine the most effective and economic
fracture stimulation methods and well spacing and the natural gas commodity
price environment. As we continue to gather data about the Marcellus Shale, it
is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our drilling
schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage position
should not be pursued at all. We refer you to the risk factor Our drilling
plans are subject to change in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Ark-La-Tex 
Our Ark-La-Tex division includes our conventional assets in the
Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma and our conventional and unconventional
assets in East Texas.  Production from these assets was 39.8 Bcfe in 2011,
compared to 53.5 Bcfe in 2010 and 56.9 Bcfe in 2009.  The decline in
production from these areas during 2011 and 2010 was primarily driven by asset
dispositions as well as natural field production declines and lower capital
investments in these areas since

Table of Contents

2009.  In May
2011, we sold the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale
intervals in approximately 9,717 net acres for approximately $118.1 million.
 In June 2010, we sold the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle
Bossier Shale intervals in approximately 20,063 net acres for approximately
$357.8 million.  We expect these sales, together with our planned decrease
in capital investments and the natural production decline in existing wells, to
decrease our net production from East Texas in 2012.  In 2011, we invested
approximately $76 million in East Texas and Arkoma and participated in 10 wells,
adding new reserves of 19 Bcfe.  Total proved net reserves from these areas
were approximately 447 Bcfe at December 31, 2011, compared to 554 Bcfe at
year-end 2010 and 538 Bcfe at year-end 2009.  In 2012, we expect to invest
approximately $18 million combined in our East Texas and Conventional Arkoma
Basin programs.
New Ventures
We actively seek to find
and develop new oil and natural gas plays with significant exploration and
exploitation potential, which we refer to as New Ventures. We have been
focusing on both oil and gas unconventional plays, and the technological methods
best suited to developing these plays, such as horizontal drilling and fracture
stimulation techniques. New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on
repeatability, multi-well potential and land availability as well as other
criteria and may be located both inside and outside of the United States. As of
December 31, 2011, we held 3,600,314 net undeveloped acres in connection with
our New Ventures prospects, of which 2,518,518 net acres were located in New
Brunswick, Canada and 520,619 net acres related to the Lower Smackover Brown
Dense (LSBD) in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. This compares to
3,009,643 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2010, of which 2,518,518 net
acres were located in New Brunswick, Canada, and 36,125 net undeveloped acres
held at year-end 2009.

In 2010, we successfully
bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of the
Province of New Brunswick, Canada to search and conduct an exploration program
covering over 2,518,518 net acres in the province in order to test new
hydrocarbon basins. As a condition under our licenses, we are required to make
investments of approximately $47 million USD in the province by March 31, 2013.
During 2011 and 2010, we conducted airborne gravity and magnetics surveys,
surface geochemistry surveys and, as of December 31, 2011, had acquired 248
miles of 2-D seismic data. While preliminary interpretation has already begun,
in 2012 we intend to continue our acquisition of approximately 130 additional
miles of 2-D seismic data and plan to drill two stratigraphic well tests in the
fourth quarter of 2012. Through December 31, 2011, we have invested
approximately $24.0 million in our New Brunswick exploration program, which
represents our first venture outside of the United States.
 
In July 2011, we announced that we would begin testing a new
unconventional horizontal oil play targeting the LSBD formation, an
unconventional oil reservoir that ranges in vertical depths from 8,000 to 11,000
feet and appears to be laterally extensive over a large area ranging in
thickness from 300 to 550 feet. At December 31, 2011, we held approximately
520,619 net undeveloped acres in the area, obtained at an average cost of $375
per acre.  Our leases currently have an 82% average net revenue interest
and an average primary lease term of 4 years, which may be extended for an
additional 4 years. The LSBD formation is an Upper Jurassic age, kerogen-rich
carbonate source rock found across the Gulf Coast region of the southern United
States from Texas to Florida. We extensively reviewed the LSBD across the region
and believe that the right mix of reservoir depth, thickness, porosity, matrix
permeability, sealing formations, thermal maturity and oil characteristics are
found in our leased areas and that the formation compares favorably to other
productive oil plays in the United States. In February 2012, we completed our
first well in the play area, the Roberson 18-19 #1-15H located in Columbia
County, Arkansas, at a total depth of approximately 9,369 feet and a horizontal
lateral length of approximately 3,600 feet. Our second well, the Garrett
7-23-5H #1 located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, was drilled to a vertical
depth in February 2012 at approximately 10,863 feet with a 6,536-foot horizontal
lateral and is expected to be completed in March 2012.  If our drilling
program yields positive results, we expect that activity in the play could
increase significantly over the next several years.
 
While we believe that
our New Ventures projects have significant exploration and exploitation
potential, there can be no assurance that all prospects will result in viable
projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments.  We refer you
to the risk factors The success of our New Ventures projects is subject to
drilling and completion technique risks and enhanced recovery methods.  Our
drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production and
the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline, and  Our exploration,
development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may not be
profitable or achieve our targeted returns in Item 1A of Part I of this Form

Divestitures
In May 2011, we sold certain oil and natural gas leases, wells and
gathering equipment in East Texas for approximately $118.1 million.  The
sale included only the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle Bossier
Shale intervals in approximately 9,717 net acres. The net production from the
Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale intervals in this acreage was approximately
7.0 MMcf per day and proved net reserves were approximately 37.1 Bcf when the
sale was closed in May 2011.
In June 2010, we sold certain oil and natural gas leases, wells
and gathering equipment in East Texas for approximately $357.8 million.
 The sale included only the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle
Bossier Shale intervals in approximately 20,063 net acres. The net production
from the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale intervals in this acreage was
approximately 13.5 MMcf per day and proved net reserves were approximately 55.4
Bcf when the sale was closed in June 2010.  
Capital
Investments
During 2011, we invested a total of $2.0 billion in our E&P
business and participated in drilling 708 wells, 447 of which were successful,
and 261 which were in progress at year-end.  Of the 261 wells in progress
at year-end, 214 were located in our Fayetteville Shale play.  Of the
approximately $2.0 billion invested in our E&P business in 2011,
approximately $1.3 billion was invested in our Fayetteville Shale play, $332
million in our Marcellus Shale play, $68 million in East Texas, $8 million in
our conventional Arkoma Basin program and $201 million in New Ventures
projects.
Of the $2.0 billion invested in 2011, approximately $1.5 billion
was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $227 million
for acquisition of properties, $30 million for seismic expenditures and $199
million in capitalized interest and other expenses.  Additionally, we
invested approximately $21 million in our drilling rig related equipment, sand
facility and other equipment.  In 2010, we invested approximately $1.8
billion in our primary E&P business activities and participated in drilling
713 wells. Of the $1.8 billion invested in 2010, approximately $1.4 billion was
invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $200 million for
acquisition of properties, $17 million for seismic expenditures and $172 million
in capitalized interest and expenses and other technology-related expenditures.
Additionally, we invested approximately $13 million in our drilling rig related
equipment, sand facility, and other equipment.  In 2009, we invested
approximately $1.6 billion in our primary E&P business activities and
participated in drilling 750 wells. Of the $1.6 billion invested in 2009,
approximately $1.3 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling
and workovers, $82 million for acquisition of properties, $32 million for
seismic expenditures and $155 million in capitalized interest and expenses and
other technology-related expenditures.  Additionally, we invested
approximately $35 million in drilling rig related and ancillary equipment.
   
In 2012, we plan to invest approximately $1.8 billion in our
E&P program and participate in drilling 555 to 565 gross wells, 510 to
530 of which are planned to be operated by us.  The Fayetteville Shale play
will be the primary focus of our capital investments, with planned investments
of approximately $1.1 billion.  Our planned 2012 capital investments also
include approximately $526 million associated with increased Marcellus Shale
play activity, $177 million in unconventional, exploration and New Ventures
projects and $18 million combined investments in East Texas and our conventional
drilling program in the Arkoma Basin.  
Of the $1.8 billion allocated to our 2012 E&P capital budget,
approximately $1.5 billion will be invested in development and exploratory
drilling, $20 million in seismic and other geological and geophysical
expenditures, $75 million in acquisition of properties and $300 million in
capitalized interest and expenses as well as equipment, facilities and
technology-related expenditures.  We refer you to Managements Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and
Capital Resources  Capital Investments for additional discussion of the
factors that could impact our planned capital investments in 2012.
Sales, Delivery Commitments
and Customers
Sales. Our daily
natural gas equivalent production averaged 1,370.0 MMcfe in 2011, compared to
1,108.8 MMcfe in 2010 and 823.1 MMcfe in 2009.  Total natural gas
equivalent production was 500.0 Bcfe in 2011, up from 404.7 Bcfe in 2010 and
300.4 Bcfe in 2009.  Our natural gas production was 499.4 Bcf in 2011,
compared to 403.6 Bcf in 2010 and 299.7 Bcf in 2009.  The increase in
production in 2011 resulted primarily from a 86.6 Bcf increase in net production
from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4 Bcf increase in net production from
our Marcellus Shale play, which more than offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease
in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties.  The
increase in 

12 SWN



Table of Contents

production in 2010 resulted primarily from
a 106.7 Bcf increase in production from the Fayetteville Shale play and an
increase in our East Texas production, which more than offset a combined 3.4
Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties.
 We also produced 97,000 barrels of oil in 2011, compared to 171,000
barrels of oil in 2010 and 124,000 barrels of oil in 2009.  Our oil
production has decreased between 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the natural
production decline in existing wells.  For 2012, we are targeting total
natural gas and crude oil production of approximately 560 to 570 Bcfe, which
represents a growth rate of approximately 13% over our 2011 production volumes,
using midpoints.

Sales of natural gas and oil production are conducted under
contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings.
We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas,
including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for
our production.  We periodically enter into various hedging and other
financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas
and crude oil production in order to support certain desired levels of cash flow
and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations.  Our policies prohibit
speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with
appropriate credit standings. At December 31, 2011, we had NYMEX commodity price
hedges in place on 266.4 Bcf, or approximately 47% of our targeted 2012 natural
gas production and 185.2 Bcf of our expected 2013 natural gas production.
 We intend to hedge additional future production volumes to the extent
natural gas prices rise to levels that we believe will achieve certain desired
levels of cash flow.  We refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10-K,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks, for further
information regarding our hedge position at December 31, 2011.
Including the effect of hedges, we realized an average wellhead
price of $4.19 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2011, compared to $4.64
per Mcf in 2010 and $5.30 per Mcf in 2009.  Our hedging activities
increased our average gas price $0.63 per Mcf in 2011, increased our average gas
price $0.71 per Mcf in 2010 and increased our average price $1.96 per Mcf in
2009.  Our average oil price realized was $94.08 per barrel in 2011,
compared to $76.84 per barrel in 2010 and $54.99 per barrel in 2009.  None
of our crude oil production was hedged during 2011, 2010 or 2009.  
During 2011, the average price received for our natural gas
production, excluding the impact of hedges, was approximately $0.48 Mcf lower
than average NYMEX prices.  Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2012 of
$3.00 per Mcf of natural gas, the average price received for our natural gas
production is expected to be approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per Mcf below the
NYMEX Henry Hub average settlement price, including the impact of our basis
hedges. Our E&P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a
discount to NYMEX settlement prices due to locational basis differentials, while
transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received.  In
2012, we expect to pay average third-party transportation charges in the range
of $0.25 to $0.30 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the range of 0.50% to
1.00% of our sales price for natural gas. In 2012, we expect to receive an
average natural gas sales price of approximately $0.45 to $0.55 less than the
average NYMEX settlement price.
Delivery Commitments. As of February 1, 2012, we had
natural gas delivery commitments of 228 Bcf in 2012 and 41 Bcf in 2013 under
existing agreements.  These commitments require the delivery of natural gas
in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Texas.   These amounts are well below
our forecasted 2012 and anticipated 2013 production from our available reserves
in our Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale and East Texas operations, which are
not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities
delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations
imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our
control that may affect our ability to meet our contractual obligations other
than those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  We expect to be able to
fulfill all of our short-term or long-term contractual obligations to provide
natural gas from our own production of available reserves, however, if we are
unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our
obligations. 
Customers. Our
customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial consumers of
natural gas. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no single
third-party customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.

Impact of
Federal Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas and Oil
Historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has
been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC.  In 1989, Congress
enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act.  The
Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting
wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers
of natural gas can be made at uncontrolled market prices.  
The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated
and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and
judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the
natural gas industry.

Table of Contents

There can be no
assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the
FERC and Congress will continue. We refer you to Other Items  Environmental
Matters and the risk factor We incur substantial costs to comply with
government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental
protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on
our business.
Competition
All phases of the oil and natural gas industry are highly
competitive.  We compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for
and development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil and
the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.
 Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other
independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and
operators.  Many of these competitors have financial and other resources
that substantially exceed those available to us. 
Competition in Arkansas has increased in recent years due largely
to the development of improved access to interstate pipelines and our discovery
of the Fayetteville Shale play. While improved intrastate and interstate
pipeline transportation in Arkansas should increase our access to markets for
our natural gas production, these markets will also be served by a number of
other suppliers.  Consequently, we will encounter competition that may
affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. Outside
Arkansas, we are less established and face competition from a larger number of
other producers.
Commencing in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders
(collectively, Order No. 636), which require interstate pipelines to provide
transportation separately, or unbundled, from the pipelines sales of natural
gas.  Order No. 636 also requires pipelines to provide open-access
transportation on a basis that is equal for all shippers.  Although Order
No. 636 does not directly regulate our activities, the FERC has stated that it
intends for Order No. 636 to foster increased competition within all phases of
the natural gas industry.  Starting in 2000, the FERC issued a series of
orders (collectively, Order No. 637), which imposed a number of additional
reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  Among
other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period, and effected
changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity
segmentation, pipeline penalties, rights of first refusal and information
reporting.  The implementation of these orders has not had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations to date. 
We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms
initiated by the FERC or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of
increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing
transparency in markets in which our natural gas is sold.  However, we do
not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other
natural gas producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other
legislative body. 
Regulation of
Hydraulic Fracturing
We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operations as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  It is an essential and
common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil,
natural gas, and associated liquids from dense subsurface rock formations. The
knowledge and expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our
operations in the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other
operating areas, currently including our Marcellus Shale acreage and, in the
near future, expected to include our exploration programs in New Brunswick,
Canada. Successful hydraulic fracturing techniques are also expected to be
critical to the development of our recently announced unconventional horizontal
oil play targeting the LSBD formation in Arkansas and Louisiana.  Hydraulic
fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the
hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the
wellbore. In our Fayetteville Shale play, the fracturing fluids we use are
comprised of over 99.9% water and sand. The remaining 0.1% is comprised
of small quantities of additives which contain chemical compounds such
as hydrochloric acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde and sodium chloride which is
used in common household products. 
In the past few years, there has
been an increased focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing
practices in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas
commissions but there have recently been a number of regulatory initiatives at
the federal and local levels as well as by other state agencies.
The Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) has asserted
federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities
involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of
drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
In addition, in July 2011, the EPA issued
proposed rules that
 
14 SWN



Table of Contents

would subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing,
transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs. The EPA proposed rules also include NSPS
standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards
include the reduced emission completion (REC) techniques developed in the EPA's
Natural Gas STAR program. The standards would be applicable to newly drilled and
fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the
proposed regulations under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology
(MACT) standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major
sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards.
Final action on the proposed rules is expected no later than February 28,
2012. We are currently evaluating the effect these proposed rules could have on
our business.
In October 2011, the EPA also announced a schedule for development
of standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to
publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The regulations will be developed under
the EPA's Effluent Guidelines Program under the authority of the Clean Water
Act. The EPA anticipates issuing the proposed rules in 2014. 
In addition to the EPAs efforts, legislation has been introduced
before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals
Act, to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. There are
also certain governmental reviews either
underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic
fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been
requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic
fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects
of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with initial results
expected to be available by late 2012 and final results by 2014. In addition,
the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the
agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using
hydraulic fracturing completion methods. Also, the U.S. Department of the
Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic
fracturing on federal lands. 
Certain states in which we operate, including Arkansas,
Pennsylvania and Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting,
regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure,
waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing
operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In
addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances,
may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or
hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal
legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in
the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply
with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or
curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production
activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of
wells. 
In the Province of New Brunswick in Canada there are presently no
hydraulic fracturing regulations but there has been increased attention on
developing a regulatory framework.
Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic
fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to
oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or
increased operating costs in
the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the
development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic
fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the
implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially
cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased
compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. We refer you to the risk factor Our
financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected by
proposed federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to
hydraulic fracturing that could result in increased costs and additional
operating restrictions or delays or prevent us realizing the value of
undeveloped acreage in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Midstream
Services
Our Midstream Services segment is well-positioned to complement
our E&P initiatives and to compete with other midstream providers for
unaffiliated business.  We generate revenue from gathering fees associated
with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of
natural gas.  Our gathering assets support our E&P operations and are
currently concentrated in our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas and our
Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania. 
Our operating income
from this segment was $248.0 million on revenues of $2.9 billion in 2011,
compared to $191.6 million on revenues of $2.5 billion in 2010 and $122.6
million on revenues of $1.6 billion in 2009.  Revenues increased in 

15 SWN



Table of Contents

2011 and 2010 primarily due to increased
gathering revenues and increased volumes marketed.  EBITDA generated by our
Midstream Services segment was $285.1 million in 2011, compared to $220.5
million in 2010 and $141.9 million in 2009.  The increases in 2011 and 2010
operating income and EBITDA were primarily due to increased gathering revenues
and marketing margins, partially offset by increased operating costs and
expenses.  We expect that the operating income and EBITDA of our Midstream
Services segment will increase over the next few years as we continue to develop
our Fayetteville Shale acreage and Marcellus Shale acreage positions.
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  We refer you to Business  Other
Items  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures in Item 1 of Part I of this
Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss)
attributable to Southwestern Energy.  

Gas
Gathering
We engage in gas
gathering activities through our gathering subsidiaries, DeSoto Gathering and
Angelina Gathering. DeSoto Gathering engages in gathering activities in Arkansas
primarily related to the development of our Fayetteville Shale play.  In
2011, we invested approximately $160.8 million related to these activities and
had gathering revenues of $408.2 million, compared to $271.3 million invested
and revenues of $316.0 million in 2010 and $214.2 million invested and revenues
of $205.6 million in 2009.  

DeSoto Gathering is
expanding its network of gathering lines and facilities throughout the
Fayetteville Shale play area. During 2011, DeSoto Gathering gathered
approximately 703.6 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play
area, including 57.4 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells.
 During 2010, DeSoto Gathering gathered approximately 562.6 Bcf of natural
gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area, including 56.6 Bcf of natural
gas from third-party wells. In 2009, DeSoto Gathering gathered approximately
367.3 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale play area, including
26.9 Bcf of natural gas from third-party wells.  The increase in volumes
gathered in over the past three years was primarily due to our growing
production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play.  At the end of 2011,
DeSoto Gathering had approximately 1,791 miles of pipe from the individual
wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment representing in
aggregate approximately 526,625 horsepower had been installed at 61 central
point gathering facilities in the field.  Our gathering revenues are
expected to grow over the next few years largely as a result of increased
development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and the increased
development activity undertaken by other operators in the play area.

Angelina Gathering
currently engages in gathering activities in East Texas and in Pennsylvania.
 At year-end 2011, Angelina Gathering had approximately 25 miles of pipe in
Texas and 13 miles of pipe in Pennsylvania.  At December 31, 2011,
compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 7,100 horsepower
had also been installed at one central point gathering facility in Pennsylvania.
 

Our gathering revenues
are expected to grow over the next few years largely as a result of increased
development of our acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale and the
increased development activity undertaken by other operators in those areas.
  
Gas Marketing
Our gas marketing
subsidiary, SES, allows us to capture downstream opportunities related to
marketing and transportation of natural gas. SES purchases natural gas
production and sells it to end-users and manages the basis and marketing
portfolio and acquires transportation rights on third party pipelines and
gathering lines.  Our current marketing operations primarily relate to the
marketing of our own natural gas production and some third-party natural gas.
 During 2011, we marketed 611.4 Bcf of natural gas, compared to 495.8 Bcf
in 2010 and 382.5 Bcf in 2009.  Of the total volumes marketed, production
from our E&P operated wells accounted for 94% in 2011, compared to 95% in
2010 and 92% in 2009.

SES is a foundation
shipper on two pipeline projects serving the Fayetteville Shale play growth,
the Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, or FEP, a 2.0 Bcf per day pipeline that
is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer
Partners, L.P., and two pipeline laterals called the Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals, have already been constructed by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC, or Texas
Gas, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP.  FEP was placed
in-service in January 2011.  SES has a maximum aggregate commitment of
1,200,000 Dekatherms per day for an initial term of ten years from the
in-service date.  SES has maximum aggregate commitments of 800,000 MMBtu
per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 MMBtu per day on the Greenville
Lateral. 
   
Prior to the
commencement of service on the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals and the
Fayetteville Express Pipeline, the majority of our natural gas from the Arkoma
Basin was moved to markets in the Midwest and was sold primarily based on two
indices, NGPL TexOk and Centerpoint East.  The Fayetteville and
Greenville Laterals and the

Fayetteville Express Pipeline allow us to
transport our natural gas to markets in the eastern United States and
interconnect with Texas Gas Zone 1, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 100, Trunkline Zone
1A, ANR, Tennessee Gas Pipeline 800, Columbia Gulf Mainline, TETCO M1 30" and
Sonat price indices.  We rely in part upon the Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals and the Fayetteville Express Pipeline to service our increased
production from the Fayetteville Shale play.  

During 2011, SES entered
into a number of short and long term firm transportation service and gathering
agreements in support of our growing Marcellus Shale operations in Pennsylvania.
In March 2011, SES entered into a precedent agreement with Millennium Pipeline
Company, L.L.C. pursuant to which it will enter into short and long term
firm natural gas transportation services on Millenniums existing system and
expansions of the system are expected to be in-service by late 2012 and late
2013.  In June 2011, SES entered into a long term agreement with Bluestone
Gathering, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTE Energy Company, pursuant to which
Bluestone Gathering will build and operate a natural gas gathering system in
Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania and Broome County, New York, and provide
gathering services to SES in support of a portion of our future Marcellus Shale
natural gas production.  The projected in-service date for the gathering
system is expected to be during the third quarter of 2012.  We have also
entered into a 15-year agreement with a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline
Partners for the construction of a gathering system in Susquehanna and
Lackawanna counties in Pennsylvania, which once constructed is expected to have
a delivery capacity of 175,000 Dekatherm/day.  SES also executed firm
transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGP) that
increase our ability to move its Marcellus Shale natural gas production in the
short term to market as well as a precedent agreement for an expansion project
with a projected in-service date of November 2013 pursuant to which SES has
subscribed for 100,000 Dekatherm/day of capacity.  TGPs expansion project
will expand its 300 Line in Pennsylvania to provide natural gas transportation
from the Marcellus Shale supply area to existing delivery points on the TGP
system.  TGP filed a certificate application for the project with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in late 2011. Pending regulatory approvals,
construction would begin in 2013, with a projected November 1, 2013 in-service
date.  We have provided certain guarantees of a portion of SESs
obligations under these agreements.  We refer you to the risk factor If
our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce our
projected supply of natural gas, our investments in our gathering operations
could be lost.  In addition, our commitments for transportation on
third-party pipelines and gathering systems could make the sale of our natural
gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
financial condition and cash flows.  

As of December 31, 2011,
SESs obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation
agreements totaled approximately $2.1 billion and we have not recognized any
guarantee obligations with respect to the firm transportation agreements and the
gathering project and services.  

Competition
Our gas gathering and marketing activities compete with numerous
other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger
financial and other resources than we have.  Some of these competitors are
other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that
are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting
competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of
consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other
transportation facilities.  We believe that our ability to compete
effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing
and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users.
Regulation
In March 2006, the
United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, issued new rules pertaining
to certain gathering lines. Compliance with the new rules has not had a material
adverse impact on our operations. We refer you to Other Items  Environmental
Matters and the risk factor We incur substantial costs to comply with
government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental
protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future in Item 1A of Part
I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of government regulation on
our Midstream Services business.

In November 2008, the
FERC issued a Final Rule in Order No. 720, which requires, in relevant part,
major non-interstate natural gas pipelines to post, on a daily basis, specific
scheduled flow information at each receipt or delivery point with a design
capacity of 15,000 MMBtu per day or more. A major non-interstate pipeline is a
pipeline that is not classified as a natural gas company under the Natural Gas
Act (NGA) of 1938 and delivers on average more than 50 million MMBtu of
natural gas annually over a three year period.  Our gathering system in
Arkansas constitutes a major non-interstate pipeline under Order No. 720. In
October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a
decision granting the Texas Pipeline Association and the Railroad Commissions
petition for review and vacating FERCs Order Nos. 720 and 720-A.  In its
order, the 5th Circuit held that Order Nos. 720 and 720-A exceeded the scope of


17 SWN



Table of Contents

FERCs authority under the NGA and that the
FERC cannot require a non-interstate pipeline to post capacity and scheduling
information. Notwithstanding the ruling, Order 720 remains in effect.
Other
Our other operations have primarily consisted of real estate
development activities concentrated on tracts of land located in Arkansas.
 There were no sales of commercial real estate in 2011, 2010 or 2009. As of
December 31, 2011, we owned our office complex in Fayetteville, Arkansas, an
interest in approximately 15 acres of undeveloped real estate near the
Fayetteville complex, our office complex in Conway, Arkansas and 1,761 acres in
or near Conway, Arkansas, related to our operations in the Fayetteville Shale
play. 
Our sand mining operations, in support of our E&P business,
are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning
mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by section 1503(a)
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and
Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.106) is included in
Exhibit 95.1 to this Form 10-K.
Other
Items
Reconciliation
of Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion
and amortization.  We have included information concerning EBITDA in this
Form 10-K because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of
a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure
commonly used in our industry.  EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Southwestern
Energy, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow
data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, or GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.
 EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
of other companies.
We believe that net
income (loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy is the financial measure
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly
comparable to EBITDA as defined.  The following table reconciles
EBITDA, as defined, with net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy for the years-ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

Environmental Regulation
  

Our operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in
which we operate.  We have operations in the United States and, to a much
lesser extent, in Canada.  In the United States, we are subject to numerous
federal, state and local laws and regulations including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or the CERCLA, the Clean
Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state statutes.  These laws and
regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding
requirements in order to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing
and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use
and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and
abandoning of wells, the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters.
 We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not
fully insured against all such risks.  Although future environmental
obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our
operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future
developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement
thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or
costs.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result
in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties
and the imposition of injunctive relief.  Changes in environmental
laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more
stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal
or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations
and financial position, as well as those in the natural gas and oil
industry in general.  Although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that
continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material
adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that this will continue in
the future.  
The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations
thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting
from such spills in United States waters.  A responsible party
includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel,
or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is
located.  OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil
cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages.  While
liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage
of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful
misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or
operating regulation.  If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate
fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply.  Few defenses
exist to the liability imposed by OPA.  OPA imposes ongoing requirements on
a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans
and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and
restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
 
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a
hazardous substance into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and
companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal
of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were
responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to
joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to
natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or the
RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and
production of natural gas and oil.  The RCRA specifically excludes from the
definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes
associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural
gas or geothermal energy.  However, legislation has been proposed in
Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil
exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes, which would make the
reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and
clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a
significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and
oil industry in general.  Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as
paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated
as hazardous waste. 
Our activities in Canada have to date been limited to certain
geological and geophysical activities that are not subject to extensive
environmental regulation.  Once we begin exploration activities in New
Brunswick, we will be subject to federal, provincial and local environmental
regulations that we believe require compliance efforts comparable to those
required in the United States.
We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased,
onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated
with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil.  Although
we have utilized operating and disposal 

19 SWN




Table of Contents
practices that
were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may
have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or
leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken
for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties have been operated
by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not
under our control.  These properties and the wastes disposed thereon
may be subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and analogous state
laws.  Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate
previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by
prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater
contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial
plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.   
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the FWPCA,
imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of
produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters.
 Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to
conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and
similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties
for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges
of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state
discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System general permits issued by the EPA prohibit the discharge
of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain
other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into
coastal waters.  Although the costs to comply with zero discharge
mandates under federal or state law may be significant, the entire industry
is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs
will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or
financial position. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain
natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits
for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of
wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention
plans.
In the past few years, there has been an increased focus on
environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices at the federal, state
and local levels of government although hydraulic fracturing is typically
regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions.  The EPA has asserted
federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities
involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of
drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
 In addition to the EPAs efforts, legislation has been introduced before
Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,
to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. There are
also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus
on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal
agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of
environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For a discussion of
hydraulic fracturing related environmental legislation, we refer you to
Exploration and Production  Federal, State and Local Regulation of Hydraulic
Fracturing and the risk factor Our financial condition and results of
operation could be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory initiatives
in the United States and Canada relating to hydraulic fracturing that could
result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays or
prevent us realizing the value of undeveloped acreage in Item 1A of Part I of
this Form 10-K. 
Employees
At December 31, 2011, we had 2,287 total employees.  None of
our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end
2011.  We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.

GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN INDUSTRY TERMS
The
definitions set forth below shall apply to the indicated terms as used in this
Form 10-K. All natural gas reserves and production reported in this Form 10-K
are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or area where the reserves
exist and at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Acquisition of
properties Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a
property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease
properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including
mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers fees, recording fees, legal costs,
and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. For additional information,
see the SECs definition in Rule 4-10(a) (1) of Regulation S-X, a link for which
is available at the SECs
website, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.    
 
Analogous
reservoir  Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments,
have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth,
temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more
advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may
provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and
estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an analogous
reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with
the reservoir of interest:
(i)
Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure
communication with the reservoir of interest);
(ii)
Same environment of deposition;
(iii)
Similar geological structure; and
(iv)
Same drive mechanism.
For additional
information, see the SECs definition in Rule 4-10(a) (2) of Regulation S-X, a
link for which is available at the SECs
website, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.   
Available
reserves  Estimates of the amounts of oil and gas which the registrant
can produce from current proved developed reserves using presently installed
equipment under existing economic and operating conditions and an estimate of
amounts that others can deliver to the registrant under long-term contracts or
agreements on a per-day, per-month, or per-year basis.  For additional
information, see the SECs definition in Item 1207(d) of Regulation S-K, a link
for which is available at the SEC's website,
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.
Bbl  One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons
liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil or other liquid
hydrocarbons.
Bcf  One billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Bcfe  One billion cubic feet of natural gas
equivalent.  Determined using the ratio of one barrel of crude oil to six
Mcf of natural gas.
Btu  British thermal unit, which is the heat
required to raise the temperature of a one-pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5
degrees Fahrenheit.
Dekatherm
 One million British thermal units (Btu).
Deterministic
estimate The method of estimating reserves or resources is called
deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience,
engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the
reserves estimation procedure. For additional information, see the SECs
definition in Rule 4-10(a) (5) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available
at the SECs website,
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/ecfrlinks.shtml.
Developed oil
and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any
category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i)
Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating
methods or in which the cost of the required    equipment is
relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii)
Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means
not involving a well.

Development
costs Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide
facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More
specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating
costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development
activities, are costs incurred to:
(i)
Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including
surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development
drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public
roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the
proved reserves.
(ii)
Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic
test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well
equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead
assembly.
(iii)
Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as
lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices,
and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and
central utility and waste disposal systems.
(iv)

I of this Form 10-K for a table that reconciles EBITDA with our net income
(loss) attributable to Southwestern Energy from our audited financial
statements.
Economically
producible The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource,
means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected
to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate
revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing

separated
vertically by intervening impervious, strata, or laterally by local geologic
barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or
adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The
geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition
are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the
broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. For
additional information, see the SECs definition in Rule 4-10(a) (15) of
Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SECs website,

Present Value
Index or PVI  A measure that is computed for projects by dividing
the dollars invested into the PV-10 resulting from the investment. 
Probabilistic
estimate The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called
probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each
unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate
a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of
occurrence. For additional information, see the SECs definition in Rule 4-10(a)

 Sized particles mixed with fracturing fluid to hold fractures open after a
hydraulic fracturing treatment.  In addition to naturally occurring sand
grains, man-made or specially engineered proppants, such as resin-coated sand or
high-strength ceramic materials like sintered bauxite, may also be used.
 Proppant materials are carefully sorted for size and sphericity to provide
an efficient conduit for production of fluid from the reservoir to the
wellbore.
Proved
developed producing Proved developed reserves that can be expected to be
recovered from a reservoir that is currently producing through existing wells.

Proved
developed reserves  Proved gas and oil that are also developed gas and
oil reserves.
Proved oil and
gas reserves   Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities
of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given
date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the
hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Also referred to as
proved reserves. For additional information, see the SECs definition in Rule
4-10(a) (22) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SECs

Proved
undeveloped reserves  Proved oil and gas reserves that are also
undeveloped oil and gas reserves.
PV-10  When used with respect to natural gas
and oil reserves, PV-10 means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated
from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future
development costs, using prices and costs in effect as of the date of the report
or estimate, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as
general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense
or to depreciation, depletion and amortization, discounted using an annual
discount rate of 10%.  Also referred to as present value. After-tax PV-10
is also referred to as standardized measure and is net of future income tax
expense.
Reserve life
index  The quotient resulting from dividing total reserves by annual
production and typically expressed in years. 
Reserve
replacement ratio  The sum of the estimated net proved reserves added
through discoveries, extensions, infill drilling and acquisitions (which may
include or exclude reserve revisions of previous estimates) for a specified
period of time divided by production for that same period of time.
Reservoir
A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation
of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water
barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. For additional

ITEM 1A.
 RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K,
the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and
future prospects.  The risk factors described below represent what we
believe are the most significant risk factors with respect to us and our
business.  In assessing the risks relating to our business, investors
should also read the other information included in this Form 10-K, including our
financial statements and the related notes and Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Cautionary Statement
about Forward-Looking Statements.
A substantial
or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse
affect on us.
In the first half of 2008, natural gas and oil prices were at or
near their highest historical levels but subsequently natural gas and oil prices
declined significantly.  Natural gas prices declined in 2011 as compared
with 2010 and have continued to decline in the first two months of 2012, and are
not expected to significantly increase in 2012.  The further significant
decline in natural gas and oil prices would have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the
quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us.
 A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would
negatively affect us in several ways including:
·
our
cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital investments
employed to replace reserves or increase production;
·
certain
reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower proved
reserves and cash flow; and
·
access
to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be
severely limited or unavailable.
Consequently, our revenues and
profitability would suffer.
Lower natural
gas and oil prices and/or increased development costs may cause us to record
ceiling test write-downs.  
We use the full cost method of accounting for our natural gas and
oil operations.  Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore
for and develop natural gas and oil properties.  Under the full cost
accounting rules of the SEC, the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil
properties  net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
deferred income taxes  may not exceed a ceiling limit on a country-by-country
basis.  This is equal to the present value of estimated future net cash
flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus
the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs
being amortized, net of related tax effects.
These rules generally require pricing future natural gas and oil
production at the unescalated natural gas and oil prices in effect at the end of
each fiscal quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow
hedges, utilizing the average price in the 12-month period prior to the end of
each fiscal quarter, defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices
were defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon
future conditions. They also require a write-down if the ceiling limit is
exceeded.  Once a write-down is taken, it cannot be reversed in future
periods even if natural gas and oil prices increase. 
In the period ended March 31, 2009, we incurred a ceiling test
write-down of $907.8 million which resulted in an operating loss for our company
for 2009. If natural gas and oil prices decline below levels utilized in our
ceiling limit test at December 31, 2011 and/or operating costs, development
costs, transportation costs or basis differentials increase, a write-down may
occur, which would adversely impact our results of operation and financial
condition.  Using the first-day-of-the-month prices of natural gas for the
first two months of 2012 and NYMEX strip prices for the remainder of 2012, as
applicable, the prices required to be used to determine the ceiling limit could
result in a ceiling test write-down in the first quarter of 2012 and are likely
to require ceiling test write-downs in each of the remaining quarters in
2012.
Our level of
indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect
operations and limit our growth.
At December 31, 2011, we had total indebtedness of $1,343.3
million, including borrowings of $671.5 million under our revolving credit
facility.  At February 23, 2012, we had long-term indebtedness of
$1,495.2 million, including borrowings of $823.4 million under our revolving
credit facility.  We currently expect to utilize the borrowing availability

under our
revolving credit facility in order to fund a portion of our capital investments
in 2012.  See also our risk
factor headed We may have difficulty financing our planned capital investments
which could adversely affect our growth, below.
The terms of our various financing agreements, including but not
limited to the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes, our
revolving credit facility and the master lease agreement relating to our
drilling rigs and our other equipment leases, which we collectively refer to as
our financing agreements, impose restrictions on our ability and, in some
cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may
otherwise desire to take, including one or more of the following:
·
incurring additional debt, including guarantees of
indebtedness;
·
creating liens on our assets; and
·
selling all or substantially all of our assets.
Our level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and
the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important
consequences for our operations, including:
·
requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash
flow for working capital, capital investments and other general business
activities;
·
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future
for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general corporate and
other activities;
·
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
·
detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn
in our business or the economy generally.
Our ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in
our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including
prevailing economic and financial conditions.  If we fail to comply with
the covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default and
the acceleration of our obligations under those agreements.  We may not
have sufficient funds to make such payments.  If we are unable to satisfy
our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell
assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from a public offering of
securities.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate
sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease
obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the
sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations.
 The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking
such actions.  Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a
public offering, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial
market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of
such offering or other financing.  We cannot assure you that any such
proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed
or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.
We may have
difficulty financing our planned capital investments, which could adversely
affect our growth.
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience
substantial capital investment and working capital needs as a result of our
drilling program. Our planned capital investments for 2012 are expected to
exceed the net cash generated by our operations under current natural gas
prices.  We expect to borrow under our credit facility to fund capital
investments that are in excess of our net cash flow and cash on hand.  Our
ability to borrow under our credit facility is subject to certain conditions.
 At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the borrowing conditions
of our credit facility.  If we are not in compliance with the terms of our
credit facility in the future or if the lenders under our credit facility are
unable to fulfill their commitments, we may not be able to borrow under the
facility to fund our capital investments.  We also cannot be certain that
other financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  In
the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our
drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our
assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.  Any such curtailment or sale
could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations.

Natural gas and
oil prices are volatile.  Volatility in natural gas and oil prices can
adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock.  This
volatility also makes valuation of natural gas and oil producing properties
difficult and can disrupt markets.
Natural gas and oil prices have historically been, and are likely
to continue to be, volatile.  In recent years, there has been a significant
decline in natural gas prices as evidenced by New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) natural gas prices ranging from a high of $13.58 per MMBtu in 2008 to
a recent low of $2.32 per MMBtu in January 2012.  The prices for natural
gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors,
including:
 
 
 
·
 
 
 
 
 
relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural
gas and oil;
 
 
 
·
market uncertainty;
·
worldwide economic conditions;
·
weather conditions;
·
import prices;
·
political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially
the Middle East; 
·
actions taken by OPEC;  
·
competition from other sources of energy; and
·
economic, political and regulatory developments.
Historically we have also experienced price volatility as a result
of locational differentials for our production from the Arkoma Basin and East
Texas, which at any time may further widen due to pipeline or other constraints.
Price volatility makes it difficult to project the return on exploration and
development projects involving our natural gas and oil properties and to
estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or
propose to acquire.  In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt
the market for natural gas and oil properties, as buyers and sellers have more
difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.  Our results of
operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things,
variations in natural gas and oil prices and production performance.  In
recent years, natural gas and oil price volatility has become increasingly
severe.  
The recent adoption of financial reform
legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative
instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other
risks associated with our business which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In July 2010, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed by Congress
and subsequently signed into law.  The new legislation required the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate
rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the
date of enactment. The CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for
certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets.  The
financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin
requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in
connection with our derivative activities.  At this time it is not possible
to predict whether or when the CFTC will adopt those rules or include comparable
provisions in its rulemaking under the new legislation or how those rules will
apply to us. The financial reform legislation may also require the
counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their
derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as
the current counterparties, and such developments may affect the business
relationships we have with those counterparties. The new legislation and any new
regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts
(including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect
our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts,
reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks, reduce our
ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase
our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties and limit our access to the
capital necessary to grow our business. If, as a result of the legislation and
regulations, we are no longer able to use derivatives as we have in the past,
our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be
less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund
capital investments. Our revenues could also be adversely affected if a
consequence of the legislation and regulations is lower commodity prices. Any of
these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

Working
interest owners of some of our properties may be unwilling or unable to cover
their portion of development costs, which could change our exploration and
development plans.  
Some of our working interest owners may have difficulties
obtaining the capital needed to finance their activities, or may believe that
estimated drilling and completion costs are excessive. As a result, these
working interest owners may choose not to participate in certain wells or be
unable or unwilling to pay their share of well costs as they become due. These
actions could cause us to change our development plans for the affected
properties.
Although our
estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited, our
estimates may still prove to be inaccurate.
Our reserve data
represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision
of our management.  Our reserve estimates are audited each year by
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum
engineering firm.  In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of
NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve
estimates.  NSAIs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which
includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately
90% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves.  NSAIs audit
process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and
selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected
fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The
properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the
audit.  The fields included in approximately the top 90% present value as
of December 31, 2011 accounted for approximately 92% of our total proved
reserves and approximately 98% of our proved undeveloped reserves.  In the
conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to
them with respect to ownership interests, oil and natural gas production, well
test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any
agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales
of production.  NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit,
something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or
sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such
information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating
thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the
year-ended December 31, 2011, on January 30, 2012, NSAI issued its audit opinion
as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated
proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been
prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing
of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers.

Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly.  Our
estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of
reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in
developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other
estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers
prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management.
 Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the
reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property
is assigned.  The reservoir engineering and financial data included in
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset
management teams and our Manager  Capital Budgeting & Reserves, who was the
technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve
estimates, and has over eight years of experience in petroleum engineering,
including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves. He reports to our
Senior Vice President  Corporate Development, who has more than 30 years of
experience in reservoir engineering, including the estimation of oil and gas
reserves in multiple basins both in the United States and internationally.
 On our behalf, the Senior Vice President  Corporate Development engages
NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and
financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our
proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. The financial data
included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting
staff. Following these reviews and the audit, the reserve estimates are
submitted by our Senior Vice President  Corporate Development, to our Chief
Executive Officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our
Board of Directors.  NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the
Board of Directors and final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves
rests with our Board of Directors.  We incorporate many factors and
assumptions into our estimates including:
·
expected reservoir characteristics based on geological,
geophysical and engineering assessments;
·
future production rates based on historical performance and
expected future operating and investment activities;
·
future oil and natural gas prices and quality and locational
differentials; and
·
future development and
operating costs.

Although we believe our
assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time
we prepare our estimates, our actual reserves could vary considerably from
estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves (in the aggregate
and for a particular geographic location), production, revenues, taxes and
development and operating

expenditures.  In addition, our
estimates of reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon
production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing
natural gas and oil prices, severance taxes, operating and development costs and
other factors.  In 2011, our reserves were revised upward by 33.7 Bcfe,
primarily due to improved performance in our Marcellus Shale properties,
partially offset by downward performance revisions in our East Texas, Arkoma and
Fayetteville properties and downward price revisions due to a comparative price
decrease in the average 2011 price from the average 2010 price.  In 2010,
our reserves were revised upward by 309.6 Bcfe, primarily due to improved
performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties and upward price revisions due
to a comparative price increase in the average 2010 price from the average 2009
price, partially offset by downward performance revisions in our East Texas
properties. In 2009, our reserves were revised upward by 92.9 Bcfe, primarily
due to improved performance in our Fayetteville Shale properties, partially
offset by downward revisions due to a comparative decrease in the average 2009
price from the year-end 2008 gas price.  These revisions represented no
greater than 7% of our total reserve estimates in each of these years, which we
believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.
 Because we review our reserve projections for every property at the end of
every year, any material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent
reserve reports.

Finally, recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires
significant capital investments and successful drilling operations.  At
December 31, 2011, approximately 2,633 Bcfe of our estimated proved reserves
were undeveloped.  Our reserve data assume that we can and will make these
expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur.
 Please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking
Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K for additional information
regarding the uncertainty of reserve estimates.
If we fail to
find or acquire additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline
materially from their current levels.
The rate of production from natural gas and oil properties
generally declines as reserves are depleted.  Unless we acquire additional
properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and
development activities, successfully apply new technologies or identify
additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves
will decline materially as reserves are produced.  Future natural gas and
oil production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in
acquiring or finding additional reserves.
Our drilling
plans for the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play are subject to
change.
As of December 31, 2011, we had drilled and completed 2,380
operated wells relating to our Fayetteville Shale play and 23 operated wells
relating to our Marcellus Shale play.  At year-end 2011, approximately 74%
of our leasehold acreage in the Fayetteville Shale was held by production,
excluding our acreage in the traditional Fairway and the approximately 163,000
net federal acres we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit.  Approximately
3% of our leasehold acreage in the Marcellus Shale was held by production at
year-end 2011. Our drilling plans are flexible and are dependent upon a number
of factors, including the extent to which we can replicate the results of our
most successful wells in addition to the natural gas and oil commodity price
environment.  The determination as to whether we continue to drill wells in
our operating areas may depend on any one or more of the following factors:
·
our ability
to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation;
·
our ability
to transport our production to the most favorable markets;
·
material
changes in natural gas prices (including regional basis differentials); 
·
changes in
the costs to drill, complete or operate wells and our ability to reduce drilling
risks;
·
the extent of
our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells;
·
the costs and
availability of oil field personnel services and drilling supplies, raw
materials, and equipment and services;
·
success or
failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same
production facilities;
·
receipt of
additional seismic or other geologic data or reprocessing of existing data;
·
the extent to
which we are able to effectively operate our own drillings rigs; 
·
availability
and cost of capital; or
·
the impact
of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in
severance taxes.

We continue to gather data about our prospects in our operating
areas, and it is possible that additional information may cause us to alter our
drilling schedule or determine that prospects in some portion of our acreage
position should not be pursued at all.
If we fail to
drill all of the wells that are necessary to hold our acreage, the initial lease
terms could expire, which would result in the loss of certain leasehold
rights.
Leases on approximately 235,167 net acres of our Fayetteville
Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful
wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases, of
which 184,696 net acres are held on federal lands.  Approximately 112,832
net acres of our Marcellus Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if
we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action
to extend the leases.  As discussed above under Our drilling plans for the
Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play are subject to change, our
ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors
that are beyond our control.  With the exception of the Ozark Highlands
Unit, which is federally leased, the current rules in Arkansas relating to the
Fayetteville Shale provide that each drilling unit would consist of a
governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators are permitted to
drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of supply.
 In Pennsylvania, the location of our Marcellus Shale acreage, there are
currently no rules establishing requirements for drilling units.  However,
current rules in Arkansas may change and rules may be implemented in
Pennsylvania that could impair our ability to drill or maintain our acreage
position.  In addition, other E&P operator drilling activity could
impair our ability to drill and maintain acreage positions.  To the extent
that any field rules prevent us from successfully drilling wells in certain
areas, we may not be able to drill the wells required to maintain our leasehold
rights and our leasehold investments could be lost.
If our
Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce our
projected supply of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations
could be lost.  In addition, our commitments for transportation on
third-party pipelines and gathering systems could make the sale of our natural
gas uneconomic, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.
Through December 31, 2011, we had invested approximately $933.0
million in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale play and
approximately $30.7 million in our gas gathering system built for the Marcellus
Shale play.  To the extent necessary to gather our production, we may make
further substantial investments in the expansion of our gas gathering systems.
 Our gas gathering business will largely rely on natural gas sourced from
our operations.  Our marketing subsidiary has also entered into multiple
firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes produced from our
Fayetteville Shale play as well as a number of firm transportation and gathering
agreements relating to the Marcellus Shale play. As of December 31, 2011, our
aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements
and gathering agreements were approximately $2.1 billion. If our Fayetteville
Shale and Marcellus Shale drilling programs fail to produce significant supplies
of natural gas, our investments in our gas gathering operations could be lost,
and we could be forced to pay demand or other charges for transportation on
pipelines and gathering systems that we would not be using.  These events
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.
Our
exploration, development and drilling efforts and our operation of our wells may
not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are
subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive
reservoirs will be discovered.  We invest in property, including
undeveloped leasehold acreage that we believe will result in projects that will
add value over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will
result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that leasehold acreage acquired by us
will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we
pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our
investment in such leasehold acreage or wells.  Drilling for natural gas
and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from
wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a
profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.  In addition,
wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return.  Our
ability to achieve our target PVI results is dependent upon the current and
future market prices for natural gas and crude oil, costs associated with
producing natural gas and crude oil and our ability to add reserves at an
acceptable cost.  We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other
advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects and in
conducting our exploration activities.  The seismic data and other
technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of
leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether natural gas or oil is present or
may be produced economically.  The use of seismic data and other
technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional
drilling strategies.
In addition, we may not be successful in implementing our business
strategy of controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order
to improve our overall return.  The cost of drilling, completing and
operating a well is often

uncertain, and
cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project.  Further, our
drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
numerous factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, title problems,
pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents,
adverse weather conditions, environmental and other governmental requirements
and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs,
equipment and services.
The success of
our New Venture projects is subject to drilling and completion technique risks
and enhanced recovery methods.  Our drilling results may not meet our
expectations for reserves or production and the value of our undeveloped New
Venture acreage could decline. 
Many of our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and
completion techniques as developed by ourselves and our service providers in
order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest
possible returns. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited
to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired
drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our
casing the entire length of the well bore, and being able to run tools and other
equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face
while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to
fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the
entire length of the well bore during completion operations, and successfully
cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation
stage. 
We may inject water into formations on some of our properties to
increase the production of crude oil, natural gas and associated liquids or
employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional
production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery
methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods
do not allow for the
extraction of crude oil, natural gas and associated liquids in a manner or to
the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our
investments in such projects. In addition, if proposed legislation and
regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing become law, the cost of
some of these enhanced recovery methods could increase substantially.
Ultimately, the success of drilling and completion techniques and
enhanced recovery methods can only be evaluated over time as more wells are
drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time
period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to
execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations,
limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices decline, the return on our
investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated
and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. 
Our financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected by legislative
and regulatory initiatives in the United States and Canada relating to hydraulic
fracturing that could result in increased costs and additional operating
restrictions or delays or prevent us realizing the value of undeveloped acreage.

We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our E&P operations as a
means of maximizing the productivity of our wells.  It is an essential and
common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil,
natural gas, and associated liquids from dense subsurface rock formations. The
knowledge and expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our
operations in the Fayetteville Shale play are being utilized in our other
operating areas, currently including our Marcellus Shale acreage and in the
future expected to also include our exploration program in New Brunswick,
Canada. Successful hydraulic fracturing techniques are also expected to be
critical to the development of our recently announced unconventional horizontal
oil play targeting the LSBD formation in Arkansas and Louisiana.  Hydraulic
fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the
hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the
wellbore. In our Fayetteville Shale play, the fracturing fluids we use are
comprised of over 99.9% water and sand. The remaining 0.1% is comprised
of small quantities of additives that contain chemical compounds such as
hydrochloric acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde and sodium chloride which is used
in common household products. 
In the past few years, there has
been an increased focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing
practices in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas
commissions but there has recently been a number of regulatory initiatives at
the federal and local levels as well as by other state agencies.  The Environmental Protection Agency
(the EPA) has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic
fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has
begun the process of drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted
regulatory authority. 
In July 2011, the EPA issued
proposed rules that would subject all oil and gas operations (production,
processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New
Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National 

32 SWN




Table of Contents
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS)
programs. The EPA proposed rules also include NSPS standards for completions of
hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission
completion (REC) techniques developed in the EPA's Natural Gas STAR program
along with the pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards
would be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing
wells that are refractured. Further, the proposed regulations under NESHAPS
include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for those glycol
dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not
currently subject to MACT standards. Final action on the proposed rules is
expected no later than February 28, 2012. We are currently evaluating the
effect these proposed rules could have on our business.
In October 2011, the EPA also announced a schedule for
development of standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas
operations to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The regulations will be
developed under the EPA's Effluent Guidelines Program under the authority of the
Clean Water Act. The EPA anticipates issuing the proposed rules in 2014. 
In addition to the EPAs efforts, legislation has been introduced
before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals
Act, to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require
disclosure of the chemicals used in the
hydraulic fracturing process. There are also
certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on
environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal
agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of
environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced
a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on
drinking water and groundwater, with initial results expected to be available by
late 2012 and final results by 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy
is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to
better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing
completion methods. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior is considering
disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal
lands. 
Certain states in which we operate, including Arkansas,
Pennsylvania and Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting,
regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure,
waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing
operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In
addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances,
may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or
hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal
legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in
the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply
with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or
curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production
activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of
wells. 
In the Province of New Brunswick in Canada, there are presently no
hydraulic fracturing regulations but there has been increased attention on
developing a regulatory framework.
Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic
fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to
oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or
increased operating costs in
the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the
development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic
fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the
implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially
cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased
compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 
We incur
substantial costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations
relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the
future.
Our exploration, production, development and gas gathering and
marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local
levels.  We have made and will continue to make large expenditures in our
efforts to comply with these regulations, including environmental regulation.
The natural gas and oil regulatory environment could change in ways that might
substantially increase these costs.  Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate
conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights.  These
regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons we may
produce and sell.  In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the FERC
regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the NGA.  Other
regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of
royalty payments.
As an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and oil
properties, and an owner of gas gathering systems and sand mine, we are subject
to various federal, state and local regulations relating to discharge of
materials into, and protection of, 

33 SWN




Table of Contents
the environment.
 These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the
cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject us to liability
for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in
affected areas.  Changes in or additions to regulations regarding the
protection of the environment could significantly increase our costs of
compliance, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
One of the responsibilities of owning and operating natural gas
and oil properties is paying for the cost of abandonment. We may incur
significant abandonment costs in the future which could adversely affect our
financial results. 
Natural gas and
oil drilling and producing operations involve various operating and
environmental risks that could result in substantial losses.
Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to
the operation and development of natural gas and oil properties, the drilling of
natural gas and oil wells and the sale of natural gas and oil, including but not
limited to encountering well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure,
fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural
gas, brine or well fluids, hydrocarbon drainage from adjacent third-party
production, release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental
hazards and risks and failure of counterparties to perform as agreed.
We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities
arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and
in amounts that we believe to be prudent.  However, our insurance does not
protect us against all operational risks.  For example, we generally do not
maintain business interruption insurance.  Additionally, pollution and
environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  These risks could
give rise to significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a
material adverse effect upon our financial results.  
Our ability to sell our natural gas and oil and/or to receive
market prices for our production may be adversely affected by constraints or
interruptions on gathering systems, pipelines, processing and transportation
systems owned or operated by us or others. 
The marketability of our natural gas and oil production depends in
part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering systems,
processing and pipeline and other transportation systems owned or operated by
third parties. The lack of available capacity in these systems and facilities
can result in the shutting-in of producing wells, the delay or discontinuance of
development plans for our properties, or lower price realizations. Although we
have some contractual control over the transportation and gathering of our
production, material changes in these business relationships could materially
affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil
production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in
supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines,
infrastructure or capacity constraints, and general economic conditions could
adversely affect our ability to produce, gather, and transport natural gas. 
 In particular, if drilling in the Marcellus Shale continues
to be successful, the amount of natural gas being produced by us and others
could exceed the capacity of, and result in strains on, the various gathering,
and transportation systems, pipelines, and other infrastructure available in
these areas. It will be necessary for additional infrastructure, pipelines,
gathering, and transportation systems and processing facilities to be expanded,
built or developed to accommodate anticipated production from these areas.
Because of the current economic climate, certain processing or pipeline and
other gathering or transportation projects that might be, or are being,
considered for these areas may not be developed timely or at all due to lack of
financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs, well fees
proposed in Pennsylvania, or other constraints. In addition, capital and other
constraints could limit our ability to build or access intrastate gathering and
transportation systems necessary to transport our production to interstate
pipelines or other points of sale or delivery. In such event, we might have to
delay or discontinue development activities or shut in our wells to wait for
sufficient infrastructure development or capacity expansion and/or sell
production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX, which would
adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
A portion of our production in any region may be interrupted, or
shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of
weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline, gathering, processing or
transportation system access or capacity, field labor issues or strikes, or we
might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a
substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could
temporarily adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies, raw
materials and qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of
operations.  
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill
wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and
other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate
significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing
periodic shortages. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for
equipment, services, personnel and raw materials (such as sand, cement,
manufactured proppants and other materials utilized in the provision of the
oilfield services).  Higher natural gas and oil prices generally stimulate
increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and
associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.  In addition,
our E&P operations also require local access to large quantities of water
supplies and disposal services for produced water in connection with our
hydraulic fracture stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs. We
cannot be certain when we will experience shortages or price increases, which
could adversely affect our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or
restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations.
Our business
could be adversely affected by competition with other companies.  
The natural gas and oil industry is highly competitive, and our
business could be adversely affected by companies that are in a better
competitive position.  As an independent natural gas and oil company, we
frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses,
concessions, marketing agreements, equipment and labor against companies with
financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess.  Many
of our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and
productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.
 Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire
additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct
operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in this highly competitive environment.  In addition, many of
our competitors have been operating in some of our core areas for a much longer
time than we have or have established strategic long-term positions in
geographic regions in which we may seek new entry.
We have made
significant investments in our oilfield service operations, including our
drilling rig and sand mine operations in order to meet certain of our oilfield
service and resource needs, lower our costs and increase of the efficiency of
our operations.  If our exploration and production activities are curtailed
or disrupted, these operations may adversely impact our results of operations.
 In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely
impact our relationships with third-party providers.  
We have made significant investments in order to meet certain of
our oilfield services needs, including establishing our own drilling rig
operations and sand mine.  In 2012, we plan to invest in and commence
providing pressure pumping services for a portion of our operated wells.
 We may make additional investments to expand these operations in the
future.  Our drilling operations are conducted through our subsidiary, DDI,
which had 404 employees as of December 31, 2011.  We have lease commitments
for 14 drilling rigs and related equipment with respect to DDI's operations and
we also own one drilling rig.  In addition to these rigs, we have contracts
with third-party drilling companies for use of their rigs which may not be
terminable without penalty.  In 2010, another of our subsidiaries, DeSoto
Sand, LLC, began operating our first sand mine in Arkansas in order to meet a
portion of our sand needs for the Fayetteville Shale play. We also purchase sand
for use in our operations from various third parties, including certain of our
oilfield service providers.  Our drilling rig and sand mine operations may
have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party
service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and
resources from other providers.  We may also compete with third-party
providers for qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our
relationships with such providers. If the operations of our drilling rigs and/or
sand mine are disrupted or our existing third-party providers discontinue their
relationships with us, we may not be able to secure alternative services or
resources on a timely basis, or at all.  Even if we are able to secure
alternative services or resources, there can be no assurance that such services
or resources will be of equivalent quality or that pricing and other terms will
be favorable to us.  If we are unable to secure third-party services or
resources or if the terms are not favorable to us, our financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected.
We depend upon
our management team and our operations require us to attract and retain
experienced technical personnel.  
The successful implementation of our business strategy and
handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy
depends, in part, on our experienced management team, as well as certain key
geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals employed by us.
 The success of our technological initiatives that support our business
enterprise is also dependent upon attracting and retaining experienced technical
professionals.  The loss of key members of

35 SWN




Table of Contents
our management
team or other highly qualified technical professionals could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
If natural gas prices decline further, our failure to hedge the
remaining portion of our expected 2012 production could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition. 
To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural
gas and oil, historically, we have entered into hedging arrangements with
respect to a significant portion of our expected production.  As of
February 23, 2012, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges on approximately 47% of
our targeted 2012 natural gas production as compared to approximately 45% for
2009, 30% for 2010 and 52% for 2011.  Our price risk management activities
increased natural gas sales by $315.6 million in 2011, increased natural gas
sales by $290.3 million in 2010 and increased natural gas sales by $587.8
million in 2009. If natural gas prices decline in 2012, unless we enter into
additional hedging arrangements, our revenues would be adversely affected.
  To the extent that we engage in additional hedging activities in the
current price environment, we would not realize the benefit of price increases
above the levels of the hedges.  
In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of
financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
·
our production is less than expected;
·
there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points
for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;
·
the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform the
contracts; or
·
a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or oil
prices.
Finally, future market price volatility could create significant
changes to the hedge positions recorded on our financial statements.  We
refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in
Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10-K.
Certain U.S.
federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and
natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future
legislation.
The elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions
currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies
has been proposed in recent years. These changes have included, among other
proposals:
·
the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and
natural gas properties; 
·
the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and
development costs; 
·
the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production
activities; and 
·
an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and
geophysical expenditures.
It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted.
The passage of these or any similar changes in federal income tax laws to
eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with
respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our ability to produce natural gas could be impaired if we are
unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are
unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable
environmental rules.
Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of
or recycle water used in our E&P operations, could adversely impact our
operations, particularly with respect to our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus
Shale operations, and also possibly our recently announced unconventional oil
play targeting the LSBD formation in Arkansas and Louisiana. Moreover, the
imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include
restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic
fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water,
drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or
production of natural gas.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as
amended, or the FWPCA, imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the
discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable
waters.  Permits must be obtained to discharge 
 
36 SWN



Table of Contents
pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in
waters and wetlands.  The FWPCA and similar state laws provide for civil,
criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of
pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other
hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced
water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances
related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. The EPA has
also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and
production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Compliance
with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal,
storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic
fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays,
interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be
predicted, all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and
financial condition.
Climate change and global warming concerns could lead to
additional regulatory measures that may adversely impact our operations and
financial condition. 
Our E&P operations are currently focused on the production of
hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, and we expect to continue to focus on
such resources in the future. The production of hydrocarbons from these sources
has an energy intensity that is a number of times higher than that for
production from conventional sources. Therefore, we expect that the carbon
dioxide, or CO2, intensity of our production will increase in the long-term. We
actively seek to reduce the environmental impact of our operations by
pursuing more efficient use of natural resources such as hydrocarbons and
water and managing and mitigating the emissions to the air, water and soil, with
a focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. With the efforts of our
Health, Safety and Environmental Department, we have been able to plan for and
comply with environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating
strategy. We anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and
expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the
protection of the environment that will increase the cost of equipment,
materials and services whose production utilizes hydrocarbons. We may also face
increased competition from alternative energy sources that do not rely on
hydrocarbons. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our
future exposure concerning such matters and if we are unable to find solutions
to environmental initiatives as they arise, including reducing the CO2 emissions
for our existing projects, we may have additional costs as well as compliance
and operational risks with respect to our existing operations as well as facing
difficulties in pursuing new projects.
Our certificate
of incorporation and, bylaws contain provisions that could make it more
difficult for someone to either acquire us or affect a change of
control.
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
together with any stockholder rights plan that we might have in place, could
discourage an effort to acquire us, gain control of the company, or replace
members of our executive management team. These provisions could potentially
deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our common stock at
above-market prices.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
The summary of our oil and natural gas reserves as of fiscal
year-end 2011 based on average fiscal-year prices, as required by Item 1202 of
Regulation S-K, is included in the table headed 2011 Proved Reserves by
Category and Summary Operating Data in Business  Exploration and Production 
Our Proved Reserves in Item 1 of this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference
into this Item 2.  Our proved reserves are based upon estimates prepared
for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the
asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is
located. These estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of
the asset management teams and by our Manager  Capital Budgeting &
Reserves, who was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the
preparation of our reserves estimates, who reports to the Senior Vice President
 Corporate Development.  Our Manager  Capital Budgeting & Reserves
has more than eight years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the
estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and holds a Bachelor of Science in
Chemical Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration.  Prior to

Our
Fayetteville Shale operations did not produce any oil for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

During 2011, we were required to file Form 23, Annual Survey of
Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, with the U.S. Department of Energy.  The
basis for reporting reserves on Form 23 is not comparable to the reserve data
included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this
Form 10-K. The primary differences are that Form 23 reports gross reserves,
including the royalty owners share, and includes reserves for only those
properties of which we are the operator.
Miles of Pipe
At December 31, 2011,
our Midstream Services segment had 1,791 miles, 25 miles and 13 miles of pipe in
its gathering systems located in Arkansas, Texas, and Pennsylvania,
respectively.

Title to Properties
We believe that we have satisfactory title to substantially all of
our active properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil
and natural gas industry.  Our properties are subject to customary royalty
and overriding royalty interests, certain contracts relating to the exploration,
development, operation and marketing of production from such properties,
consents to assignment and preferential purchase rights, liens for current
taxes, applicable laws and other burdens, encumbrances and irregularities in
title, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect
the value of such properties.  Prior to acquiring undeveloped properties,
we endeavor to perform a title investigation that is thorough but less vigorous
than that we endeavor to conduct prior to drilling, which is consistent with
standard practice in the oil and natural gas industry.  Generally, before
we commence drilling operations on properties that we operate, we endeavor to
conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to
significant defects before proceeding with operations.  We believe that we
have performed a thorough title examination with respect to substantially all of
our active properties that we operate.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment. Our policy is to accrue environmental and cleanup related
costs of a non-capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes
any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows.   
In February 2009, SEPCO was added as a defendant in a Third
Amended Petition in the matter of Tovah Energy, LLC and Toby Berry-Helfand v.
David Michael Grimes, et, al.  In the Sixth Amended Petition, filed in July
2010, in the 273rd District Court in Shelby County, Texas (collectively, the
Sixth Petition), plaintiff alleged that, in 2005, they provided SEPCO with
proprietary data regarding two prospects in the James Lime formation pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement and that SEPCO refused to return the proprietary
data to the plaintiff, subsequently acquired leases based upon such proprietary
data and profited therefrom.  Among other things, the plaintiffs
allegations in the Sixth Petition included various statutory and common law
claims, including, but not limited to claims of misappropriation of trade
secrets, violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, breach of fiduciary duty
and confidential relationships, various fraud based claims and breach of
contract, including a claim of breach of a purported right of first refusal on
all interests acquired by SEPCO between February 15, 2005 and February 15, 2006.
 In the Sixth Petition, plaintiff sought actual damages of over $55 million
as well as other remedies, including special damages and punitive damages of
four times the amount of actual damages established at trial. 
Immediately before the commencement of the trial in November 2010,
plaintiff was permitted, over SEPCOs objections, to file a Seventh Amended
Petition claiming actual damages of $46 million and also seeking the equitable
remedy of disgorgement of all profits for the misappropriation of trade secrets
and the breach of fiduciary duty claims. In December 2010, the jury found in
favor of the plaintiff with respect to all of the statutory and common law
claims and awarded $11.4 million in compensatory damages. The jury did not,
however, award the plaintiff any special, punitive or other damages. In
addition, the jury separately determined that SEPCOs profits for purposes of
disgorgement were $381.5 million. This profit determination does not constitute
a judgment or an award. The plaintiffs entitlement to disgorgement of profits
as an equitable remedy will be determined by the judge and it is within the
judges discretion to award none, some or all the amount of profit to the
plaintiff.  On December 31, 2010, the plaintiff filed a motion to enter the
judgment based on the jurys verdict.  On February 11, 2011, SEPCO filed a
motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to disregard
certain findings.  On March 11, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended motion
for judgment and intervenor filed its motion for judgment seeking not only the
monetary damages and the profits determined by the jury but also seeking, as a
new remedy, a constructive trust for profits from 143 wells as well as future
drilling and sales of properties in the prospect areas.  A hearing on the
post-verdict motions was held on March 14, 2011.  At the suggestion of the
judge, all parties voluntarily agreed to participate in non-binding mediation
efforts.  The mediation occurred on April 6, 2011 and was unsuccessful. On
June 6, 2011, SEPCO received by mail a letter dated June 2, 2011 from the judge,
in which he made certain rulings with respect to the post-verdict motions and
responses filed by the parties. In his rulings, the judge denied SEPCOs motion
for judgment, judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to disregard certain
findings. Plaintiffs and intervenors claim for a constructive trust was denied
but the judge ruled that plaintiff and intervenor shall recover from SEPCO $11.4
million and a reasonable attorneys fee of 40% of the total damages awarded and
are entitled to recover on their claim for disgorgement.  The judge
instructed that SEPCO calculate the profit on the designated wells for each
respective period.  SEPCO performed the calculation and provided it to the
judge in June 2011.  On July 5, 2011, plaintiff and intervenor filed a
letter with the court raising objections to the accounting provided by SEPCO, to
which SEPCO filed a response on July 11, 2011.  On July 12, 2011, the judge
sent a letter to the parties in which he ruled that after reviewing the parties
respective position letters, he was awarding $23.9 million in disgorgement
damages in favor of the plaintiff and intervenor.  In the July 12, 2011
letter, the judge instructed the plaintiff and intervenor to prepare a judgment
for his approval prior to July 21, 2011 consistent with his findings in his June
2, 2011 letter and the disgorgement award.  On August 24, 2011, a judgment
was entered pursuant to which plaintiff and intervenor are entitled to recover
approximately $11.4 million in actual damages and approximately $23.9 million in
disgorgement as well as prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees which currently
are estimated to be up to $8.9 million and all costs of court of the plaintiff
and intervenor.  On September 22, 2011, the plaintiff and intervenor filed
a motion to modify, correct or reform the judgment which requested that the
court vacate the final judgment ordering SEPCO to produce additional accounting
information and reconsider the amount SEPCO should disgorge.  On September
23, 2011, SEPCO filed a motion for a new trial and on November 18, 2011 filed a
notice of appeal.  On November 30, 2011, the court approved SEPCOs
supersedeas bond in the amount of $14.1 million, which stays execution on the
judgment pending appeal.  The bond covers the $11.4 million judgment for
actual damages, plus $1.3 million in pre-judgment interest, $1.3 million in
post-judgment interest (estimating two years for the duration of appeal), and
court costs.  
The Company believes that SEPCO has a number of legal grounds for
appealing the judgment, all of which will be vigorously pursued.  Based on
the Company's understanding and judgment of the facts and merits of this case,
including 

42 SWN




Table of Contents
appellate
defenses, and after considering the advice of counsel, the Company has
determined that, although reasonably possible after exhaustion of all appeals,
an adverse final outcome to this lawsuit is not probable.  As such, the
Company has not accrued any amounts with respect to this lawsuit.  If the
plaintiff and intervenor were to ultimately prevail in the appellate process,
the Company currently estimates, based on the judgments to date, that SEPCOs
potential liability would be up to $44.2 million, including interest and
attorneys fees.  The Companys assessment may change in the future due to
occurrence of certain events, such as denied appeals, and such re-assessment
could lead to the determination that the potential liability is probable and
could be material to the Company's results of operations, financial position or
cash flows. 
On February 20, 2012, the Company became aware that SEPCO was
named as a defendant in the matter of Gery Muncey v. Southwestern Energy
Production Company, et al filed in the District Court of San Augustine County in
Texas on January 31, 2012.  The plaintiff in this case is also the
intervenor in the Tovah Energy matter described above and alleges various claims
including fraud, misappropriation and breach of fiduciary duty that are
purported as independent of the claims alleged in the Tovah Energy matter but
arise from the substantially same circumstances involved in the Tovah Energy
matter.  The plaintiff is seeking value for various royalty and override
ownership interests in wells drilled, disgorgement of profits and punitive
damages.  The Company has not accrued any amounts with respect to this
lawsuit and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any potential liability
based on the Companys understanding and judgment of the facts and merits of
this case.
In March 2010, the Companys subsidiary, SEECO, Inc., was served
with a subpoena from a federal grand jury in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Based
on the documents requested under the subpoena and subsequent discussions
described below, the Company believes the grand jury is investigating matters
involving approximately 27 horizontal wells operated by SEECO in Arkansas,
including whether appropriate leases or permits were obtained therefor and
whether royalties and other production attributable to federal lands have been
properly accounted for and paid.  The Company believes it has fully
complied with all requests related to the federal subpoena and delivered its
affidavit to that effect. The Company and representatives of the Bureau of Land
Management and the U.S. Attorney have had discussions since the production
of the documents pursuant to the subpoena.  In January 2011, the Company
voluntarily produced additional materials informally requested by the government
arising from these discussions.  Although, to the Companys knowledge, no
proceeding in this matter has been initiated against SEECO, the Company cannot
predict whether or when one might be initiated. The Company intends to fully
comply with any further requests and to cooperate with any related
investigation. No assurance can be made as to the time or resources that will
need to be devoted to this inquiry or the impact of the final outcome of the
discussions or any related proceeding. 
We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that
have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
individually or in aggregate, such litigation, claims and proceedings will not
have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of
operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
managements view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect
becomes reasonably estimable. We accrue for such items when a liability is both
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
ITEM 4.
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
 Our sand mining operations, in
support of our E&P business, are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of
1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters
required by section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.106) is

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks
described in the Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements below,
in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and elsewhere in this annual report. You
should read the following discussion with the Item 6. Selected Financial Data
and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this
Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
Background

Southwestern Energy
Company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and crude oil
exploration, development and production (E&P). We are also focused on
creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and
marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services. We operate
principally in two segments: E&P and Midstream Services.
   

Our primary business is
the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil, with our current
operations being principally focused within the United States on development of
an unconventional gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma
Basin, which we refer to as the Fayetteville Shale play.  We are also
actively engaged in exploration and production activities in Pennsylvania, where
we are targeting the unconventional gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale,
and to a lesser extent in Texas and in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the Arkoma
Basin.  We have recently commenced exploration operations in Arkansas and
Louisiana testing an unconventional oil play targeting the Lower Smackover Brown
Dense formation.  In 2010, we commenced an exploration program in New
Brunswick, Canada, which represents our first operations outside of the United
States.

We are focused on
providing long-term growth in the net asset value of our business, which we
achieve in our E&P business through the drillbit. We derive the vast
majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production
of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future. We expect
that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on
natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production. We
expect our natural gas production volumes will continue to increase due to our
ongoing development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas and the Marcellus
Shale play in Pennsylvania. The price we expect to receive for our natural gas
is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our
properties and increase our production.  In recent years, there has been a
significant decline in natural gas prices as evidenced by New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices ranging from a high of $13.58 per MMBtu in
2008 to a recent low of $2.32 per MMBtu in January 2012.  Natural gas
prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict. These
factors, which include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater
exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and
economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and
demand for natural gas, which in turn determines the sale prices for our
production. In addition to the factors identified above, the prices we realize
for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational
differences in market prices.

Recent Financial and Operating
Results

We reported net income
attributable to Southwestern Energy of $637.8 million in 2011, or $1.82 per
diluted share, up from net income attributable to Southwestern Energy of $604.1
million in 2010, or $1.73 per diluted share.  We reported a net loss
attributable to Southwestern Energy of $35.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted
share, in 2009. The loss in 2009 included a $907.8 million, or $558.3 million
net of taxes, non-cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas
and oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas
prices during the first quarter of 2009.  Our cash flow from operating
activities increased 6% to $1,739.8 million in 2011 due to an increase in net
income adjusted for non-cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in
working capital accounts, and increased 21% to $1,642.6 million in 2010 due to
an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working
capital.
 
        In 2011, our
natural gas and oil production increased 24% to 500.0 Bcfe, up from 404.7 Bcfe
in 2010.  The 95.3 Bcfe increase in our 2011 production resulted from a
86.6 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4
Bcf increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more
than offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas
and Arkoma Basin properties. In 2010, our natural gas and oil production
increased to 404.7 Bcfe, up from 300.4 Bcfe in 2009.  We are targeting 2012
natural gas and oil production of 560 to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately
13% over our 2011 production, using midpoints.  Our year-end reserves 

48 SWN




Table of

grew 19% in 2011 to 5,893 Bcfe, up from
4,937 Bcfe at the end of 2010 and 3,657 Bcfe at the end of 2009, primarily as a
result of the continued development of our Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus
Shale play. 

Our E&P segment
reported operating income of $825.1 million in 2011, down from $829.5 million in
2010. Operating income in 2011 decreased $4.4 million over 2010 as the revenue
impact of our 24% increase in production was more than offset by the 10% decline
in our average realized gas prices and a $214.4 million increase in operating
costs that resulted from our significant production growth.  We recorded
operating income from our E&P segment of $829.5 million in 2010, up from an
operating loss of $157.7 million in 2009. The operating loss in 2009 included a
$907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas
and oil properties.  Excluding the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test
impairment, operating income in 2010 increased $79.4 million over 2009 as a
result of the revenue impact of our 35% increase in production which was
partially offset by the 12% decline in our average realized gas prices and a
$217.8 million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our
significant production growth. 

Operating income for our
Midstream Services segment was $248.0 million in 2011, up from $191.6 million in
2010 and $122.6 million in 2009. Operating income for our Midstream Services
segment increased in 2011 due to an increase of $92.2 million in gathering
revenues and an increase of $5.8 million in the margin generated from our
natural gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a $41.6 million
increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of gas purchase costs, that
resulted from our continued significant growth in volumes gathered. Volumes
gathered grew to 745.7 Bcf in 2011 compared to 588.3 Bcf in 2010. Operating
income for our Midstream Services segment increased in 2010 due to an increase
of $110.4 million in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.5 million in the
margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities, which were partially
offset by a $46.9 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of
gas purchase costs, that resulted from our significant growth in volumes
gathered. Volumes gathered grew to 588.3 Bcf in 2010 compared to 387.1 Bcf in
2009.

We had total capital
investments of $2,207.2 million in 2011, compared to $2,120.1 million in 2010
and $1,809.1 million in 2009.  Of our total capital investments, $1,977.5
million was invested in our E&P segment in 2011 compared to $1,775.5 million
and $1,565.5 million invested in our E&P segment in 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Outlook

We believe the outlook
for our business is favorable despite the continued uncertainty of natural gas
prices in the United States and the legislative and regulatory challenges facing
our industry. Our resource base, financial strength and disciplined investment
of capital provide us with an opportunity to exploit and develop our position in
the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play, maximize efficiency
through economies of scale in our key operating areas, enhance our overall
returns through expansion of our Midstream Services operations and grow through
new exploration and development activities. Our capital investment plan for 2012
is flexible and is based on our expectation that natural gas prices will remain
at current price levels.  Should prices decline materially from their
current levels we will adjust our capital investment plans accordingly.

segment were up $210.0 million, or 11%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Higher natural
gas production volumes in 2011 increased revenues by $445.0 million while lower
realized prices for our natural gas production decreased revenue by $227.9
million compared to 2010.  E&P revenues were up $297.2 million, or 19%,
in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher natural gas production volumes in 2010
increased revenues by $551.0 million while lower realized prices for our natural
gas production decreased revenue by $265.1 million. We expect our natural gas
production volumes to continue to increase due to our development of the
Fayetteville Shale properties in Arkansas and our Marcellus Shale properties in
Pennsylvania.  Natural gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and
subject to wide price fluctuations. As of February 23, 2012, we had hedged 266.4
Bcf of our remaining 2012 natural gas production and 185.2 Bcf of our 2013
natural gas production to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations.
 For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities,
we refer you to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this
Form 10-K and to Commodity Prices below for additional information.

Production

In 2011, our natural gas
and oil production increased 24% to 500.0 Bcfe, up from 404.7 Bcfe in 2010.
 The 95.3 Bcfe increase in our 2011 production resulted from a 86.6 Bcf
increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 22.4 Bcf
increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more than
offset a combined 13.7 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and
Arkoma Basin properties.  Natural gas and oil production was up
approximately 35% to 404.7 Bcfe in 2010, as compared to 2009, due to a 106.7 Bcf
increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale play and a 1.0 Bcf
increase in net production from our Marcellus Shale properties, which more than
offset a combined 3.4 Bcfe decrease in net production from out East Texas and
Arkoma Basin properties.  Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale
play was 436.8 Bcf in 2011, up from 350.2 Bcf in 2010 and 243.5 Bcf in 2009.

We are targeting 2012
natural gas and oil production of 560 to 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately
13% over our 2011 production, using midpoints. Approximately 465 to 470 Bcf of
our 2012 targeted natural gas production is projected to come from our
activities in the Fayetteville Shale play. Although we expect production volumes
in 2012 to increase, we cannot guarantee our success in discovering, developing
and producing reserves, including with respect to our Fayetteville Shale play.
Our ability to discover, develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number
of factors, many of which

are beyond our control, including the
availability of capital, the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil
prices and competition. There are also many risks inherent in the discovery,
development and production of natural gas and oil. We refer you to Risk
Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks
and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Commodity Prices

The average price
realized for our natural gas production, including the effects of hedges,
decreased 10% to $4.19 per Mcf in 2011 and decreased 12% to $4.64 per Mcf in
2010. The decrease in the average price realized in 2011 compared to 2010
primarily reflects the decrease in average market prices and to a lesser extent
the decreased effect of our natural gas price hedging activities, which had a
greater positive impact on our average realized gas price in 2010 (see
additional discussion below). The decrease in the average price realized in 2010
compared to 2009 primarily reflected the decrease in average market prices,
which was partially offset by the positive effect of our price hedging
activities in 2010.  We periodically enter into various hedging and other
financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas
and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow
and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in
locational market differentials (we refer you to Item 7A of this Form 10-K, Note
5 to the consolidated financial statements, and our hedge risk factor for
additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities).

Our hedging activities
increased the average gas price $0.63 per Mcf in 2011, compared to an increase
of $0.71 per Mcf in 2010 and an increase of $1.96 per Mcf in 2009. Disregarding
the impact of hedges, the average price received for our natural gas production
in 2011 was $0.37 per Mcf lower than 2010 and $0.48 lower than the average
monthly NYMEX settlement price for 2011.
 
 At December 31,
2011, we had basis protected on approximately 269.4 Bcf of our 2012 expected
natural gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales
arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.02
per Mcf. 
In addition to the basis
hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2011, we had NYMEX fixed price hedges in
place on notional volumes of 185.9 Bcf of our remaining 2012 natural gas
production at an average price of $5.02 per MMBtu and collars in place on
notional volumes of 80.5 Bcf of our 2012 natural gas production at an average
floor and ceiling price of $5.50 and $6.67 per MMBtu, respectively. At December
31, 2011, we had NYMEX fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of 185.2
Bcf of our 2013 natural gas production.
 
Our E&P segment
receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly
NYMEX settlement prices due to locational basis differentials, while
transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received. Assuming
a NYMEX commodity price of $3.00 per Mcf for 2012, and disregarding the impact
of hedges, we expect our total gas sales discount to NYMEX to be $0.45 to $0.55
per Mcf. 

We realized an average
price of $94.08 per barrel for our oil production for the year ended December
31, 2011, up approximately 22% from the prior year. The 2010 average realized
price of $76.84 per barrel was up 40% from 2009. We did not hedge any of our
2011, 2010 or 2009 oil production.

Operating Income

Operating income from
our E&P segment decreased $4.4 million to $825.1 million in 2011 from $829.5
million in 2010 as the revenue impact of our 24% increase in production was more
than offset by the 10% decrease in our average realized gas prices and a $214.4
million increase in operating costs that resulted from our significant
production growth. We recorded an operating loss from our E&P segment of
$157.7 million in 2009.  The operating loss in 2009 includes a $907.8
million non-cash ceiling test impairment of our United States natural gas and
oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas prices
during the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling
test impairment, operating income in 2010 increased $79.4 million over 2009 as a
result of the revenue impact of our 35% increase in production which was
partially offset by a 12% decline in our average realized gas prices and a
$217.8 million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our
significant production growth.  

Operating Costs and Expenses

Lease operating expenses
per Mcfe for the E&P segment were $0.84 in 2011, compared to $0.83 in 2010
and $0.77 in 2009. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in
2011 primarily due to increased gathering costs associated with our Fayetteville
Shale operations. Lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in
2010 

51 SWN




Table of
Contents
 
compared to 2009 primarily due to increased
gathering, compression and water disposal costs associated with our Fayetteville
Shale operations.  We expect our per unit operating cost for this segment
to range between $0.86 and $0.90 per Mcfe in 2012.

General and
administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $0.27 per Mcfe in 2011,
down from $0.30 per Mcfe in 2010 and $0.35 per Mcfe in 2009. The decreases in
general and administrative costs per Mcfe in 2011 and 2010 were due to the
effects of our increased production volumes. In total, general and
administrative expenses for the E&P segment were $134.8 million in 2011,
$120.3 million in 2010 and $105.0 million in 2009. The increases in general and
administrative expenses since 2009 were primarily a result of increased payroll,
incentive compensation, employee-related costs and professional fees associated
with the expansion of our E&P operations due to the continued development of
the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play. These increases accounted
for $11.1 million, or 76%, of the 2011 increase and $13.6 million, or 89%, of
the 2010 increase. We added 106 new E&P employees during 2011 compared to
253 employees added in 2010.

We expect our per unit
cost for general and administrative expenses in 2012 to range between $0.29 and
$0.33 per Mcfe.  The expected increase in our per unit general and
administrative costs in 2012 is due to general increases in our G&A and
increased compensation costs associated with ongoing development of our
Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays. Future changes in our general and
administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary
costs, level of pension expense, amount of stock-based compensation expense and
the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees and level and
intensity of our operating activities. For eligible employees, a portion of
incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and
performance results, including production, proved reserve additions, present
value added for each dollar of capital invested, and lease operating expenses
and general and administrative expenses per unit of production, while another
portion is discretionary based upon an employees performance. 

Taxes other than income
taxes per Mcfe were $0.11 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Taxes
other than income taxes per Mcfe vary from period to period due to changes in
severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production
volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Effective January 1, 2009, the
State of Arkansas changed the severance tax on natural gas wells to be based on
the market value of natural gas produced.  

Our full cost pool
amortization rate averaged $1.30 per Mcfe for 2011, $1.34 per Mcfe for 2010 and
$1.51 per Mcfe for 2009. The decline in the average amortization rate for 2011
compared to 2010 was primarily the result of lower acquisition and development
costs and sale of certain East Texas properties in 2011 and 2010. The decline in
the average amortization rate for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result
of lower acquisition and development costs combined with the $907.8 million
non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and the
sale of certain East Texas oil and natural gas leases and wells in the second
quarter of 2010 as the proceeds from the sale were appropriately credited to the
full cost pool. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of
reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of
previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs
that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties
that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization.
We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due
to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other
factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future
reserves attributed to our Fayetteville Shale play.

Unevaluated costs
excluded from amortization were $942.9 million at the end of 2011 compared to
$712.1 million at the end of 2010 and $595.4 million at the end of 2009. 
Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization at the end of 2011 included $27.9
million related to our properties in Canada. The increase in unevaluated costs
since December 31, 2010 primarily resulted from a $172.9 million increase in our
undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs as well as a $103.7 million
increase in our drilling activity in our wells in progress. See Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization.

The timing and amount of
production and reserve additions could have a material impact on our per unit
costs; if production or reserves additions are lower than projected, our per
unit costs could increase.

Revenues

Revenues from our
marketing activities were up 15% to $2,451.3 million for 2011 compared to 2010.
The increase in marketing revenues resulted from increases in the volumes
marketed which partially offset a decrease in the prices received for volumes
marketed. Revenues from our marketing activities were up 53% to $2,137.8 million
for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in marketing revenues for 2010 resulted
from increases in the volumes marketed combined with an increase in the prices
received for volumes marketed. The average price received for volumes marketed
decreased 7% in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 18% in 2010 compared to
2009. Volumes marketed increased 23% in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 30%
in 2010 compared to 2009. Of the total volumes marketed, production from our
E&P operated wells accounted for 94% in 2011, 95% in 2010 and 92% in 2009.
Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices
are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses.

Revenues from our
gathering activities were up 29% to $408.2 million for 2011 compared to 2010,
and were up 54% to $316.0 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The increases in
gathering revenues primarily resulted from a 27% increase in gas volumes
gathered in 2011 compared to 2010 and a 52% increase in gas volumes gathered in
2010 compared to 2009. Substantially all of the increases in gathering revenues
for 2011 and 2010 resulted from increases in the volumes gathered from our
operated production from the Fayetteville Shale play. Gathering volumes,
revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as
production from our Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays increase.

Operating Income 

Operating income from
our Midstream Services segment increased 29% to $248.0 million in 2011 and
increased 56% to $191.6 million in 2010. The increases in operating income
reflect the substantial increases in gas volumes gathered and marketed which
resulted primarily from our increased E&P production volumes. The increase
in operating income for 2011 compared to 2010 was due to an increase of $92.2
million in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.8 million in the margin
generated from our gas marketing activities, which were partially offset by a
$41.6 million increase in operating costs and expenses, exclusive of purchased
gas costs.  The increase in operating income for 2010 compared to 2009 was
due to a $110.4 million increase in gathering revenues and an increase of $5.5
million in the margin generated from our gas marketing activities, which were
partially offset by a $46.9 million increase in operating costs and expenses,
exclusive of purchased gas costs.

The margin generated
from gas marketing activities was $33.2 million for 2011, compared to $27.4
million for 2010 and $21.9 million for 2009.  Margins are primarily driven
by volumes of gas marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for
commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities.  The
increases in margins generated are primarily the result of a 23% increase in
volumes marketed in 2011 and a 30% increase in volumes marketed in 2010, as
compared to prior years, resulting from marketing our increased E&P
production volumes. We enter into hedging activities from time to time with
respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection.  For
more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we refer
you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 5
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Interest
Expense 
Interest expense, net of
capitalization, was $24.1 million in 2011, a decrease of $2.1 million compared
to 2010, primarily due to a increase in capitalized interest. Interest
capitalized increased to $45.7 million in 2011 from $32.9 million in 2010,
primarily due to an increase in our weighted average interest rate and average
borrowed balance under our credit facility during 2011, which had a weighted
average interest rate of 2.06% for 2011 and an increase in our unevaluated

properties.

In 2010, interest
expense, net of capitalization, was $26.2 million, an increase of $7.5 million
compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest. Interest
capitalized decreased to $32.9 million in 2010 from $40.2 million in 2009,
primarily due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate during 2010 as
a result of the increase in our average borrowed balance under our credit
facility, which had a weighted average interest rate of 1.06% for 2010.

Income
Taxes
Our effective tax rate
was 39.3% in 2011 and 2010 and 31.5% in 2009.  Our effective tax rate,
excluding the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment of our natural gas
and oil properties, would have been 39.0% for 2009. In general, differences
between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of 35% primarily
result from the effect of certain state income taxes and permanent items
attributable to book-tax differences.    

Stock-Based
Compensation Expense
We recognized expense of
$10.6 million and capitalized $8.5 million for stock-based compensation in 2011,
compared to $9.8 million expensed and $6.8 million capitalized in 2010 and $10.2
million expensed and $5.9 million capitalized in 2009. We refer you to Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity
based compensation plans.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

We depend primarily on
internally-generated funds, our Credit Facility, sales of non-core assets and
funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of
liquidity. 

During 2012, assuming
natural gas prices remain at current levels, we expect to draw on a portion of
the funds available under the Credit Facility to fund the portion of our planned
capital investments (discussed below under Capital Investments), that are
expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations.  We refer you
to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K
and the section below under Financing Requirements for additional discussion
of our Credit Facility.

Net cash provided by
operating activities increased 6% to $1.7 billion in 2011, due to an increase in
net income adjusted for non-cash expenses which was partially offset by changes
in working capital accounts.  Net cash provided by operating activities
increased 21% to $1.6 billion in 2010, due to an increase in net income adjusted
for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital accounts.  For 2011,
requirements for our capital investments were funded from our cash generated by
operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Facility and the proceeds from
the sale of certain East Texas oil and natural gas properties.  Net cash
from operating activities provided 80% of our cash requirements for capital
investments in 2011, 79% in 2010 and 76% in 2009. 

At December 31, 2011,
our capital structure consisted of 25% debt and 75% equity. We believe that our
operating cash flow and available funds under our Credit Facility will be
adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for 2012. The credit
status of the financial institutions participating in our Credit Facility could
adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the Credit Facility. While we
believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds,
we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation. 

Our cash flow from
operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive
for our natural gas and oil production. Natural gas and oil prices are subject
to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which
are impacted by the overall state of the economy. The price received for our
production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities, as more fully
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this
Form 10-K and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk. Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our
counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction. We actively
monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative
and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default
swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults
associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more
counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating
activities.

Additionally, our
short-term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from
our customers and partners. We actively manage this risk through credit
management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced
any significant write-offs for non-collectable amounts. However, any sustained
inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact
our cash flows.

Due to the above
factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow
from operations. Accordingly, we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash
dependent upon available cash flow.

Capital
Investments
Our capital investments
were $2.2 billion in 2011, up from $2.1 billion in 2010. Capital investments
include an increase of $4.3 million in 2011, an increase of $14.4 million in
2010 and an increase of $12.2 million in 2009 related to the change in accrued
expenditures between years. Our E&P segment investments in 2011 were $2.0
billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.6 billion in 2009.

Our capital investments for 2012 are planned to be $2.1 billion,
consisting of approximately $1.8 billion for E&P, $190 million for Midstream
Services and $90 million for corporate and other purposes. Of the approximate
$1.8 billion, we expect to allocate approximately $1.1 billion to our
Fayetteville Shale play. Our planned level of capital investments in 2012 is
expected to allow us to continue our progress in the Fayetteville Shale and
Marcellus Shale programs and explore and develop other existing natural gas and
oil properties and generate new drilling prospects. As discussed above, our 2012
capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from
operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. The planned capital program
for 2012 is flexible and can be modified, including downward, if the low natural
gas price environment persists for an extended period of time.  We will
reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing
market conditions and, if natural gas prices change significantly in 2012, we
could change our planned investments.
Financing
Requirements
Our total debt outstanding was $1,343.3 million at December 31,
2011, compared to $1,094.2 million at December 31, 2010. 
In February 2011, we
amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the
borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date to February
2016.  The amount available under the revolving credit facility may be
increased to $2.0 billion at any time upon the Companys agreement with its
existing or additional lenders. We had $671.5 and $421.2 million outstanding
under its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010,
respectively. 

The interest rate on our
Credit Facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently
200 basis points over LIBOR. At February 23, 2012, our publicly traded notes are
rated BBB- by Standard and Poors and we have a Corporate Family Rating of Baa3
by Moodys. Any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of
funds under the Credit Facility.

Our Credit Facility contains covenants which impose certain
restrictions on us. Under the Credit Facility, we must keep our total debt at or
below 60% of our total capital, and must maintain a ratio of EBITDA to interest
expense of 3.5 or above. Our Credit Facilitys financial covenants with respect
to capitalization percentages exclude the noncontrolling interest in equity, the
effects of non-cash entries that result from any full cost ceiling impairments,
hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities.
Therefore, under our Credit Facility, our capital structure at December 31, 2011
would have been 27% debt and 73% equity. We were in compliance with all of the
covenants of our Credit Facility at December 31, 2011. Although we do not
anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with
those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development
program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for
natural gas and oil.  If we are unable to borrow under our Credit Facility,
we would have to decrease our capital investment plans.

At December 31, 2011,
our capital structure consisted of 25% debt and 75% equity compared to 27% debt
and 73% equity at December 31, 2010.  Our debt percentage of total capital
at December 31, 2011 decreased in 2011, primarily due to our profitable results
and the minimal funding of our capital investments and operational needs through
debt.  Equity at December 31, 2011 included an accumulated other
comprehensive gain of $424.9 million related to our hedging activities and a
loss for $15.9 million related to our pension and other postretirement
liabilities. The amount recorded in equity for our hedging activities is based
on current market values for our hedges at December 31, 2011 and does not
necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges are
ultimately settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received
associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged.

Our hedges allow us to
ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations.  At February
23, 2012, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 266.4 Bcf, or
approximately 47% of our targeted 2012 natural gas production and 185.2 Bcf of
our expected 2013 natural gas production.  The amount of long-term debt we
incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans.


Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 
We may enter into
off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material
off-balance sheet obligations.  At December 31, 2011, the Companys

As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had
commitments for demand transportation charges on various pipelines, including
approximately $1.0 billion related to the FEP pipeline and $0.7 billion related
to the Boardwalk Pipeline.
(2)
Operating leases include costs for compressors, aircraft,
vehicles, office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases
expiring through 2019. Additionally, this includes $58.1 million for leases of
14 drilling rigs and related equipment through 2014.
(3)
As of December 31, 2011, our E&P segment had commitments for
approximately $548.3 million to companies for fracture stimulation services,
which are cancellable under certain circumstances.     
(4)
As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services segment had
commitments of approximately $100.6 million and our E&P segment had
commitments of approximately $6.5 million for compression services associated
primarily with our Fayetteville Shale play operations.
(5)
Purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders under
existing agreements.  As of December 31, 2011, our Midstream Services
segment had outstanding purchase obligations of $12.7 million relating to
compression units.
(6)
In conjunction with our exploration program in New Brunswick,
Canada, we provided promissory notes payable on demand to the Minister of
Finance of the Province of New Brunswick with an aggregate principal amount of
CAD $44.5 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information regarding our commitments related to our exploration
program in Canada. Our other significant contractual obligations include
approximately $127.5 million for asset retirement obligations primarily relating
to oil and gas properties, approximately $12.0 million for funding of benefit
plans, approximately $9.6 million for various information technology support and
data subscription agreements, approximately $7.1 million for insurance premium
financing and approximately $7.4 million related to seismic services.  

We refer you to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements
for a discussion of the terms of our debt.
Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities 
Substantially all of our
employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. We
currently expect to contribute approximately $12.7 million to our pension plans
and $0.2 million to our postretirement benefit plan in 2012. For 2011, we
contributed $12.5 million to our pension plans and contributed $0.1 million to
our postretirement benefit plan. At December 31, 2011 we recognized a liability
of $20.5 million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans compared to a liability of $15.9 million at
December 31, 2010. For further information regarding our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies below for additional
information.

Working
Capital
We maintain access to
funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our Credit
Facility described in Financing Requirements above. We had positive working
capital of $93.4 million at December 31, 2011 and negative working capital of
$113.1 million at December 31, 2010. Current assets increased $397.4 million
during 2011 primarily due to a $384.1 million increase in our current hedging
asset which was partially offset by a $9.7 million decrease in  

57 SWN




Table of

accounts receivable. Current liabilities
increased $190.9 million primarily due to a $150.1 million increase in our
current deferred income taxes related to our hedging activities, a $40.2 million
increase in accounts payable, and a $2.4 million increase in advances from
partners.  

Natural Gas in Underground
Storage

We currently have one facility owned by our E&P segment that
contains natural gas in underground storage. Natural gas in storage that is
expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current assets.
This current portion of natural gas in storage is classified as inventory and is
carried at the lower of cost or market.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
current portion of natural gas in storage was $7.8 million and $10.0 million,
respectively. The non-current portion of natural gas in storage is classified in
property and equipment and carried at cost.  The carrying value of the
non-current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. 
The natural gas in
inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement production in
meeting the segments contractual commitments, especially during periods of
colder weather. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas, we
utilize the natural gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be
able to realize for our natural gas in inventory. A significant decline in the
future market price of natural gas could require a write-down of our natural gas
in underground storage carrying cost.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES
The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following
describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.
Natural Gas and
Oil Properties
We utilize the full cost
method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and
acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs
(productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal
costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized  on a
country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the
properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are
subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable
deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues
attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at 10 percent
(standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved
properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash
expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher
natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Effective
December 31, 2009, companies using the full cost method were required to use the
average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12
months, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, to
calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. For quarter and annual periods
ending prior to December 31, 2009, prices in effect at the date of each
accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow
hedges, were required to be used. 

Using the average quoted
price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub
natural gas of $4.12 per MMBtu and $92.71 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate
oil, adjusted for market differentials, the Companys net book value of its
United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount
and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2011. Cash flow
hedges of natural gas production in place increased this ceiling amount by
approximately $262.5 million at December 31, 2011. Decreases in average market
prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of
costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and service costs
could result in future ceiling test impairments.  Using the
first-day-of-the-month prices of natural gas for the first two months of 2012
and NYMEX strip prices for the remainder of 2012, as applicable, the prices
required to be used to determine the ceiling limit could result in a ceiling
test write-down in the first quarter of 2012 and are likely to require ceiling
test write-downs in each of the remaining quarters in 2012.  At December
31, 2010, the ceiling value of the Companys reserves was calculated based upon
year-end quoted market prices of $4.38 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and
$75.96 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2009, the
ceiling value of the Companys 

58 SWN




Table of
Contents
 
reserves was calculated based upon year-end
quoted market prices of $3.87 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and $57.65 per
barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. Decreases in market prices as well as
changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded
from amortization, future development costs and production costs could result in
future ceiling test impairments. At March 31, 2009, the net capitalized costs of
our natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $558.3
million (net of tax) and resulted in a non-cash ceiling test impairment using
quarter-end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and
$46.00 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil.

All of our costs
directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of properties in New
Brunswick, Canada relating to our exploration program at December 31, 2011 were
unproved and did not exceed the ceiling amount.  If our exploration program
in Canada is unsuccessful on all or a portion of these properties, a ceiling
test impairment may result in the future.

Natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly.  Our
estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of
reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in
developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other
estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers
prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management.
 Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the
reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property
is assigned.  The reservoir engineering and financial data included in
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset
management teams and our Manager  Capital Budgeting & Reserves, who was the
technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve
estimates, and has over eight years of experience in petroleum engineering,
including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves, who reports to our
Senior Vice President  Corporate Development.  Our Senior Vice President 
Corporate Development has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir
engineering, including the estimation of oil and gas reserves in multiple basins
both in the United States and internationally.  On our behalf, the Senior
Vice President  Corporate Development engages NSAI, a worldwide leader of
petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and
government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as
discussed in more detail below. The financial data included in the reserve
estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Following these
reviews and the audit, the reserve estimates are submitted by our Senior Vice
President  Corporate Development to our Chief Executive Officer for his review
and approval prior to the presentation to our Board of Directors.  NSAI
reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors and final
authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our Board of
Directors.  
In each of the past three years, revisions to our proved reserve
estimates represented no greater than 7% of our total proved reserve estimates,
which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls.
Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this
estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non-producing
reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the
majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted
for 55% of our total reserve base at December 31, 2011. Assigning monetary
values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of
such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are
compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of
production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the
reserves.  We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently
address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating
quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our
control.  We refer you to Although our estimated natural gas and oil
reserve data is independently audited, our estimates may still prove to be
inaccurate in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Form 10-K for a more
detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors.
In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI
study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve
estimates.  NSAIs audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which
includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately
90% of present worth of the companys total proved reserves.  NSAIs audit
process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and
selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected
fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves.  The
properties in the bottom 20% of the total present worth are not reviewed in the
audit.  The fields included in approximately the top 90% present value as
of December 31, 2011, accounted for approximately 92% of our total proved
reserves and approximately 98% of our proved undeveloped reserves.  In the
conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to
them with respect to ownership interests, oil and natural gas production, well
test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any
agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales
of production.  NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit,
something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or
sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such
information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating
thereto or had independently verified such information or data. For the
year-ended December 31, 2011, on January 30, 2012, NSAI issued its audit opinion
as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates, stating that our estimated
proved oil and gas reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been

prepared in
accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
A decline in natural gas and oil prices used to calculate the
discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of
cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported. Our reserve base is nearly
100% natural gas, therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as
significant an impact as natural gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve
quantities. Our standardized measure and reserve quantities at December 31,
2011, were $3,450.8 million and 5,893.2 Bcfe, respectively. An assumed decrease
of $1.00 per Mcf in the average 2011 natural gas price used to price our
reserves would have resulted in an approximate $1,472.6 million decline in our
standardized measure and an approximate decrease of 947 Bcfe of our reported
reserves. The decline in reserve quantities, assuming this decrease in natural
gas price, would have the impact of increasing our unit of production
amortization of the full cost pool. The unit of production rate for amortization
is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates, capitalized costs
and future development costs.
Hedging
We use natural gas and
crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and
cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil. Our policies
prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties
with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We
actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both
quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and
credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit
defaults associated with our transactions. From 2006 through 2008, we
established a portfolio of hedges relating to approximately 60% to 80% of our
annual production.  However, only 45%, 30% and 52% of our 2009, 2010, and
2011 production, respectively, was hedged due to credit and overall market
events of 2008 and 2009 as well as the low commodity price environment
throughout 2010 and 2011. The primary market risks related to our derivative
contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for
natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is generally offset by
the gain or loss recognized upon the related natural gas or oil transaction that
is hedged.

Our derivative
instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements and generally
qualify for hedge accounting. We have established the fair value of derivative
instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with
assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other
sources. These valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance
sheet and, to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on
equity production, the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income. Results
of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil
sales. Any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any
ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in
earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an unrealized gain
of $5.2 million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for
hedge accounting in addition to a $4.2 million loss related to the change in
estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges. Future market price
volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in
our financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Form 10-K for
additional information regarding our hedging activities.

Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits

We record our prepaid or
accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and
other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we
consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these
benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the
discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively
settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate
of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2011 benefit
obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2012, the discount
rate assumed is 5.00%. For the 2012 periodic benefit cost, the expected return
assumed is 7.50%. This compares to a discount rate of 5.50% and an expected
return of 7.50% used in 2011.  

Using the assumed rates
discussed above, we recorded total benefit cost of $11.5 million in 2011 related
to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Due to the
significance of the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return, the
following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a 50 basis point
change in those assumptions would have had on our 2011 pension expense:

At December 31, 2011, we
recognized a liability of $20.5 million, compared to $15.9 million at December
31, 2010, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During
2011, we also made cash payments totaling $12.6 million to fund our pension and
other postretirement benefit plans. In 2012, we expect to make cash payments
totaling $12.9 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans and recognize pension expense of $12.0 million and a postretirement
benefit expense of $2.2 million. 

New Accounting
Standards Implemented in this Report
In January 2011, we
implemented certain provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements (Update 2010-06).  Update 2010-06 requires
entities to provide a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance and
settlements of anything valued with a Level 3 method, which is used to price the
hardest to value instruments. The implementation did not have an impact on our
results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In July 2011, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive
Income (Update 2011-05), which amends Topic 200, Comprehensive
Income. Update 2011-05 eliminates the option to present components of other
comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of changes in stockholders
equity, and requires presentation of total comprehensive income and components
of net income in a single statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate,
consecutive statements. Update 2011-05 requires presentation of reclassification
adjustments for items transferred from OCI to net income on the face of the
financial statements where the components of net income and the components of
OCI are presented. The amendments do not change current treatment of items in
OCI, transfer of items from OCI, or reporting items in OCI net of the related
tax impact. Update 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2011.  The implementation of these changes did
not have an impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Accounting
Standards Not Yet Implemented
In May 2011, the FASB
issued guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements outlined
in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic
820)Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS (Update 2011-04).  Update 2011-04
expands existing fair value disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3
inputs, including: quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and
assumptions used in the measurement; description of the valuation processes in
place and sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and
interrelationships between those inputs; the level of items (in the fair value
hierarchy) that are not measured at fair value in the balance sheet but whose
fair value must be disclosed; and the use of a nonfinancial asset if it differs
from the highest and best use assumed in the fair value measurement. The
amendments in Update 2011-04 must be applied prospectively and are effective
during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The
implementation of the disclosure requirement is not expected to have a material
impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position
or cash flows.

In December 2011, the
FASB issued guidance on offsetting assets and liabilities and disclosure
requirements in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, Disclosures about
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (Update 2011-11).  Update 2011-11
requires that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments
and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as
well as instruments and transaction s subject to an agreement similar to a
master netting agreement.  In addition, the standard requires disclosure of
collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or
similar arrangements.  Update 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those
annual periods.  The implementation of the disclosure requirement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2011, the
FASB issued guidance on accumulated other comprehensive income in Accounting
Standards Update No. 2011-12,
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for
Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards

61 SWN




Table of
Contents
 
Update No. 2011-05 (Update
2011-12).  Update 2011-12 defers the specific requirement to present items
that are classified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income
separately with their respective components of net income and other
comprehensive income, as promulgated under Update 2011-05.  Update 2011-12
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15,
2011, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of the disclosure
requirement is expected to have on the Companys consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). 

We caution you that
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are subject to all of the
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the
exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas and oil.
These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility,
third-party interruption of

sales to market, inflation, lack of
availability of goods and services, environmental risks, drilling and other
operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating
proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production
and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in Item 1A
of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Estimates of our proved
natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such
reserves in this Form 10-K are based upon various assumptions, including
assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas and oil prices, drilling
and operating expenses, capital investments, taxes and availability of funds.
The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. This process
requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available
geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
Therefore, those estimates are inherently imprecise. 

Actual future
production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development costs,
operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves
will most likely vary from those estimated. Such variances may be material. Any
significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and
present value of reserves set forth in this Form 10-K. Our properties may also
be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on
adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to
reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing
natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. 

At December 31, 2011,
approximately 45% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and
1% were proved developed non-producing. Proved undeveloped reserves and proved
developed non-producing reserves, by their nature, are less certain than proved
developed producing reserves. Estimates of reserves in the non-producing
categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the
performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved
undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful
drilling operations. Recovery of proved developed non-producing reserves
requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is
subject to the risk of a successful recompletion. Production revenues from
proved undeveloped and proved developed non-producing reserves will not be
realized, if at all, until sometime in the future. 

The reserve data assumes
that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves.
Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the
costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we
cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will
occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. 

You should not assume
that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10-K is
the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In
accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows
from proved reserves are generally based on average prices over the preceding
twelve months and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and
costs may be materially higher or lower than the average prices and costs as of
the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in
governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash
flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development
and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of
actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In
addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in
calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not
necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company.

Should one or more of
the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Form 10-K occur,
or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans
could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information
contained in a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its
entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related
damages.

All forward-looking
statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this
cautionary statement.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risks relating to
our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis
differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use
natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to
reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the
prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of Directors has
approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products
for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial
products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of
our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and
limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings.

Credit Risk

Our financial
instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities
trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited
due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic
areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues at December
31, 2011.  See Commodities Risk below for discussion of credit risk
associated with commodities trading.

Interest Rate Risk

The following table
presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related
weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of December 31,
2011. At December 31, 2011, we had $1,343.3 million of total debt with a
weighted average interest rate of 4.87% and we had $671.5 million of
indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. Interest rate swaps may be
used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate. We do not have
any interest rate swaps in effect currently.

Commodities Risk

We use over-the-counter
natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our
production and to hedge activity in our Midstream Services segment against the
inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing
differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps
and options include (1) transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price
(or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable
price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps),
(2) transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different
indices (referred to as basis swaps) and (3) the purchase and sale of
index-related puts and calls (collars) that provide a floor price, below which
the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the
commodity is below the contracted floor, and a ceiling price above which we
pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above
the contracted ceiling.

The primary market risks
relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and
basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price
risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase
of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. Credit risk relates to the
risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties. The
counterparties are primarily major commercial banks, investment banks, and
integrated energy companies which management believes present minimal credit
risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial
exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit
risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit
default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty
losses related to non-performance and do not anticipate any losses given the
information we have currently. However, we cannot be certain that we will not
experience such losses in the future.

At December 31, 2011,
our basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded
in natural gas and oil sales. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded
an unrealized gain of $5.2 million related to the basis swaps that did not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment and an unrealized loss of $4.2 million
related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges.
Typically, our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a
reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the
derivative contract, which is primarily a NYMEX price, and the index price for
the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged. 

Additionally, at
December 31, 2010, we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on
12.0 Bcf of 2011 natural gas production that did not qualify for hedge
treatment.

Midstream Services

At December 31, 2011,
our Midstream Services segment had outstanding fair value hedges in place on 0.1
Bcf of natural gas for 2012. These hedges are a mixture of floating-price swap
purchases and sales relating to our natural gas marketing activities. These
hedges have contract months from January 2012 to March 2012 and have a net fair
value liability of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2011.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 
Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  We have performed an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting.  Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2011.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate.
Our management used the
criteria set forth in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to perform its assessment. Based
on this assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer, concluded, that as of December 31, 2011, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
  

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report that follows.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Southwestern Energy Company:

In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southwestern
Energy Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
 Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it estimates the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves in 2009 and
the limitation on its capitalized costs as of December 31, 2009.  

A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND
SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
 
(1) ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
 
Nature of
Operations
Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries,
collectively, Southwestern or the Company) is an independent energy company
engaged in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production. The
Company engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production, natural gas
gathering and natural gas marketing through its subsidiaries. Southwesterns
exploration, development and production (E&P) activities are principally
focused within the United States on development of an unconventional gas
reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, which the Company
refers to as the Fayetteville Shale play.  The Company is also actively
engaged in exploration and production activities in Pennsylvania, where we are
targeting the unconventional gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and to
a lesser extent in Texas and in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin.
 The Company has recently commenced exploration operations in southern
Arkansas and northern Louisiana testing a new unconventional horizontal oil play
targeting the Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation.  Southwesterns
natural gas gathering and marketing (Midstream Services) activities primarily
support the Companys E&P activities in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and
Texas.
Basis of
Presentation
The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K present the Companys financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  The Company evaluates subsequent events through the date the
financial statements are issued.
Principles of
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Southwestern and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In 2010, the
Company purchased the non-controlling interest in Overton Partners, L.P.
 
Revenue
Recognition
Gas and oil sales. Gas sales and oil sales are recognized
when the products are sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price,
delivery has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the revenue
is reasonably assured. The Company uses the entitlement method that requires
revenue recognition for the Companys net revenue interest of sales from its
properties.  Accordingly, gas sales and oil sales are not recognized for
deliveries in excess of the Companys net revenue interest, while gas sales and
oil sales are recognized for any under delivered volumes. Production imbalances
are generally recorded at estimated sales prices of the anticipated future
settlements of the imbalances. At December 31, 2011, the Company had
overproduction of 6.1 Bcf valued at $22.5 million and underproduction of 6.4 Bcf
valued at $22.9 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company had overproduction of
3.9 Bcf valued at $13.3 million and underproduction of 3.7 Bcf valued at $12.8
million. 
Gas marketing. The Company generally markets its natural
gas, as well as some gas produced by third parties, to brokers, local
distribution companies and end-users, pursuant to a variety of contracts. Gas
marketing revenues are recognized when delivery of natural gas has occurred,
title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability of
the revenue is reasonably assured. 
Gas gathering. The Company gathers its natural gas, as well
as some gas produced by third parties, pursuant to a variety of contracts. Gas
gathering revenues are recognized when the service is performed, the price is
fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.

 
75 SWN



Table of Contents

Other. The Company maintains an underground gas storage
facility and generally sells natural gas from its storage facility during the
winter gas withdrawal season. Revenue is recognized on natural gas storage sales
when the natural gas is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price,
delivery has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the revenue
is reasonably assured. Other revenues include gains of $0.9 million, $2.5
million and $3.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily related
to the sale of gas in underground storage. 
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined by the Company as
short-term, highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three
months or less and deposits in money market mutual funds that are readily
convertible into cash.  Management considers cash and cash equivalents to
have minimal credit and market risk.
Certain of the Companys cash accounts are zero-balance controlled
disbursement accounts that do not have the right of offset against the Companys
other cash balances. The Company presents the outstanding checks written against
these zero-balance accounts as a component of accounts payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding checks included as a
component of accounts payable totaled $47.7 million and $23.1 million at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Inventory
Inventory recorded in current assets includes $7.8 million at
December 31, 2011 and $10.0 million at December 31, 2010, for natural gas in
underground storage owned by the Companys E&P segment, and $38.4 million at
December 31, 2011 and $25.1 million at December 31, 2010 for tubulars and other
equipment used in the E&P segment.
The Company has one natural gas storage facility. The current
portion of the natural gas is classified in inventory and carried at the lower
of cost or market. The non-current portion of the natural gas is classified in
property and equipment and carried at cost. The carrying value of the
non-current natural gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. Withdrawals of
current natural gas in underground storage are accounted for by a weighted
average cost method whereby natural gas withdrawn from storage is relieved at
the weighted average cost of current natural gas remaining in the facility.
Other assets include $19.5 million at December 31, 2011 and $20.6
million at December 31, 2010 for inventory held by the Midstream Services
segment consisting primarily of pipe that will be used to construct gathering
systems.   
Tubulars and other equipment are carried at the lower of cost or
market and are accounted for by a moving weighted average cost method that is
applied within specific classes of inventory items. Purchases of inventory are
recorded at cost and inventory is relieved at the weighted average cost of items
remaining within a specified class. 
Property,
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Natural Gas and Oil Properties. The Company utilizes the
full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development
and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such
costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other
internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized on a
country by country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the
properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs, less
accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, are subject to a
ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value
of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves
discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market
value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off
as a non-cash expense.  The expense may not be reversed in future periods,
even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the
ceiling. Full cost companies must use the average quoted price from the first
day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of
derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of
their reserves.
Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month
from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $4.12 per MMBtu and
$92.71 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market
differentials, the Companys net book value of its United States natural gas and
oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling
test impairment at December 31, 2011. Cash flow hedges of natural gas production
in place increased this ceiling amount by approximately $262.5 million at
December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, this ceiling amount of the Companys
reserves was calculated based upon average quoted market prices of $4.38 per
MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas and $75.96 per barrel for West Texas
Intermediate oil, and at December 31, 2009, the ceiling value of the 
 
76 SWN




Table of Contents
Companys reserves
was calculated based upon year-end quoted market prices of $3.87 per MMBtu for
Henry Hub natural gas and $57.65 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil.
Decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of
reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development
costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments.
 At March 31, 2009, the net capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil
properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $558.3 million (net of tax) and
resulted in a non-cash ceiling test impairment in the first quarter of
2009. 
All of our costs directly associated with the acquisition and
evaluation of properties in New Brunswick, Canada relating to our exploration
program at December 31, 2011 were unproved and did not exceed the ceiling
amount.  If our exploration program in Canada is unsuccessful on all or a
portion of these properties, a ceiling test impairment may result in the
future.
On December 31, 2009, the Company implemented certain provisions
of FASB ASC 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas, as updated by Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-03, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas (Topic 932)
(FASB ASC 932), which (a) expand the definition of oil- and gas-producing
activities; (b) require energy companies to value their proved reserves by
averaging the price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months
instead of using a year-end price; and (c) allow for additional drilling
locations to be classified as proved undeveloped reserves assuming such
locations are supported by reliable technologies. The Company accounted for the
FASB ASC 932 changes as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable
from a change in accounting estimate and will account for the change
prospectively. The Company is not able to disclose the effects resulting from
the implementation of these changes on the amount of proved reserves and
disclosed quantities because personnel and time constraints made it infeasible
for the Company to perform a second internal reserve estimation process under
the prior standards on its approximately 4,850 properties.
Gathering Systems. The Companys investment in gathering
systems is primarily related to its Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas and
Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania.  These assets are being depreciated
on a straight-line basis over 25 years.
Capitalized Interest. Interest is capitalized on the cost
of unevaluated gas and oil properties that are excluded from amortization and
actively being evaluated.
Asset Retirement Obligations.  An asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is
recognized as a liability in the period incurred or when it becomes
determinable, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement
cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The asset retirement
obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value and accretion expense is
recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected
settlement value. The Company owns natural gas and oil properties which require
expenditures to plug and abandon the wells when reserves in the wells are
depleted. 
Income
Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the
differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted
rate change. Deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the income tax
effect of reporting certain transactions in different years for income tax and
financial reporting purposes.  A valuation allowance is established to
reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax
benefits will not be realized. 
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a
recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is
recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the
position. The amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities
reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax
uncertainties.

Derivative
Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
defined commodity price risks and does not use them for speculative trading
purposes. The Company uses commodity swaps and options contracts to hedge sales
of natural gas. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of hedge
contracts have been recognized in gas sales in the consolidated statements of
operations when the contracts expire and the related physical transactions of
the commodity hedged are recognized. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive
income (loss) to the extent that they are effective in offsetting the changes in
the cash flows of the hedged item.  In contrast, gains and losses from the
ineffective portion of swaps and option contacts as well as basis swap contracts
that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recognized currently in
gas sales in the consolidated statements of operations.  Changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as well as
the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings
immediately.  See Note 5 for a discussion of the Companys hedging
activities.
Earnings Per
Share
Basic earnings per common share attributable to Southwestern
Energy stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to
Southwestern Energy by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each year. The diluted earnings per share attributable to Southwestern
Energy stockholders calculation adds to the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding the incremental shares that would have been outstanding
assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options and the vesting of unvested
restricted shares of common stock. 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, outstanding options for
3,577,104 shares with an average exercise price of $11.78 were included in the
calculation of diluted shares. Options for 881,254 shares were excluded from the
calculation because they would have had an antidilutive effect. For the year
ended December 31, 2010, outstanding options for 4,753,530 shares with an
average exercise price of $9.42 were included in the calculation of diluted
shares. Options for 548,160 shares were excluded from the calculation because
they would have had an antidilutive effect. For the year ended December 31,
2009, 6,683,085 of the Companys outstanding options with an average exercise
price of $8.33 were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares because they
would have had an antidilutive effect.  
For the year ended December 31, 2011, 241,044 shares of restricted
stock were included from the calculation of diluted shares. The calculation
excluded 135,352 shares of restricted stock because they would have had an
antidilutive effect. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 700,512 shares of
restricted stock were included from the calculation of diluted shares. The
calculation excluded 39,600 shares of restricted stock because they would have
had an antidilutive effect. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the number of
shares of restricted stock excluded from the calculation of diluted shares was
836,861 because they would have had an antidilutive
effect.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation transactions
using a fair value method and recognizes an amount equal to the fair value of
the stock options and stock-based payment cost in either the consolidated
statement of operations or capitalizes the cost into natural gas and oil
properties or gathering systems included in property and equipment. Costs are
capitalized when they are directly related to the acquisition, exploration and
development activities of the Companys natural gas and oil properties or
directly related to the construction of the Companys gathering systems.

New
Accounting Standards Implemented in this Report
In January 2011, we implemented certain provisions of Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (Update
2010-06).  Update 2010-06 requires entities to provide a reconciliation of
purchases, sales, issuance and settlements of anything valued with a Level 3
method, which is used to price the hardest to value instruments. The
implementation did not have an impact on our results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. 
In July 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (Update 2011-05), which
amends Topic 200, Comprehensive Income. Update 2011-05 eliminates the
option to present components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the
statement of changes in stockholders equity, and requires presentation of total
comprehensive income and components of net income in a single statement of
comprehensive income, or in two separate, consecutive statements. Update 2011-05
requires presentation of reclassification adjustments for items transferred from
OCI to net income on the face of the financial statements where the components
of net income and the components of OCI are presented. The amendments do not
change current treatment of items in OCI, transfer of items from OCI, or
reporting items in OCI net of the related tax impact. Update 2011-05 is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2011.  The implementation of these changes did not have an impact on the
Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Accounting
Standards Not Yet Implemented
In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurement
and disclosure requirements outlined in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value
Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS (Update
2011-04).  Update 2011-04 expands existing fair value disclosure
requirements, particularly for Level 3 inputs, including: quantitative
disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement;
description of the valuation processes in place and sensitivity of the fair
value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those
inputs; the level of items (in the fair value hierarchy) that are not measured
at fair value in the balance sheet but whose fair value must be disclosed; and
the use of a nonfinancial asset if it differs from the highest and best use
assumed in the fair value measurement. The amendments in Update 2011-04 must be
applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2011. The implementation of the disclosure
requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance on offsetting assets
and liabilities and disclosure requirements in Accounting Standards Update No.
2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (Update
2011-11).  Update 2011-11 requires that entities disclose both gross and
net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the
statement of financial position as well as instruments and transaction s subject
to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement.  In addition, the
standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection
with master netting agreements or similar arrangements.  Update 2011-11 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013,
and interim periods within those annual periods.  The implementation of the
disclosure requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance on accumulated other
comprehensive income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral
of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of
Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards
Update No. 2011-05 (Update 2011-12).  Update 2011-12 defers the
specific requirement to present items that are classified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components
of net income and other comprehensive income, as promulgated under Update
2011-05.  Update 2011-12 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2011, and interim periods within those annual
periods.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
implementation of the disclosure requirement is expected to have on the
Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
   
(2) DIVESTITURES
 
In May 2011, we sold certain oil and natural gas leases, wells and
gathering equipment in East Texas for approximately $118.1 million.  The
sale included only the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle Bossier
Shale intervals in approximately 9,717 net acres. The net production from the
Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale intervals in this acreage was approximately
7.0 MMcf per day and proved net reserves were approximately 37.1 Bcf when the
sale was closed in May 2011.
At closing, the Company
deposited $85.0 million of proceeds from this sale with a qualified intermediary
to facilitate potential like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031
of the Internal Revenue Code. The remaining funds were classified as restricted
cash in the consolidated balance sheet and, unless utilized for one or more
like-kind exchange transactions, were restricted in their use until November
2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company utilized $82.1 million
of these restricted funds for like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.

In June 2010, we sold certain oil and natural gas leases, wells
and gathering equipment in East Texas for approximately $357.8 million.
 The sale included only the producing rights to the Haynesville and Middle
Bossier Shale intervals in approximately 20,063 net acres. The net production
from the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale intervals in this acreage was
approximately 13.5 MMcf per day and proved net reserves were approximately 55.4
Bcf when the sale was closed in June 2010.

our exploration program in New Brunswick, Canada.

Of the total net
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization at December 31, 2011, approximately
$83.2 million is related to unevaluated seismic costs in the Fayetteville Shale
play, approximately $101.3 million is related to acquisition of undeveloped
properties in the Companys Fayetteville Shale play, approximately $179.4
million is related to acquisition of undeveloped properties in the Companys
Marcellus Shale play and approximately $245.0 million is related to acquisition
of undeveloped properties in the Companys New Ventures, excluding our
exploration program in New Brunswick, Canada. The Company has $27.9 million of
unevaluated costs related to its exploration program in Canada. Additionally,
the Company has approximately $180.2 million of unevaluated costs related to
costs of wells in progress. The remaining costs excluded from amortization are
related to properties which are not individually significant and on which the
evaluation process has not been completed. The timing and amount of property
acquisition and seismic costs included in the amortization computation will
depend on the location and timing of drilling wells, results of drilling, and
other assessments. The Company is, therefore, unable to estimate when these
costs will be included in the amortization computation.

capitalized $43.4 million, $32.9 million and $40.2 million during 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively, based on the Companys weighted average cost of borrowings
used to finance the expenditures. 

In addition to
capitalized interest, the Company also capitalized internal costs of $147.7
million, $139.2 million and $112.9 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009,

Income tax expense is calculated by applying the statutory tax rates to the
revenues less costs, including depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
after giving effect to permanent differences and tax credits.
 
Natural Gas and Oil Reserve
Quantities 

The Company engaged the
services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), an independent
petroleum engineering firm, to audit the reserves estimated by the Companys
reservoir engineers. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of
NSAI studied the Companys major properties in detail and independently
developed reserve estimates.  NSAIs audit consists primarily of
substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of the Companys major
properties and accounted for approximately 90%, 85% and 88% of the present worth
of the Companys total proved reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and a reserve
audit is less rigorous in nature than a reserve report prepared by an
independent petroleum engineering firm containing its own estimate of reserves.
Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and the Companys reserve estimates
are generally based upon extrapolation of historical production trends, analogy
to similar properties and volumetric calculations. Accordingly, the Companys
estimates are expected to change, and such changes could be material and occur
in the near term as future information becomes available.

The following
standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved
natural gas and oil reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are calculated
after income taxes and discounted using a 10% annual discount rate and do not
purport to present the fair market value the Companys proved gas and oil
reserves:

Under the standardized
measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying an average price from
the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, adjusted for known
contractual changes, to the estimated future production of year-end proved
reserves in 2011 and 2010, and utilized year-end pricing in 2009. Prices used
for the standardized measure above were average market prices of $4.12 per MMBtu
for natural gas and $92.71 per barrel for oil in 2011, average market prices of
$4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $75.96 per barrel for oil in 2010, and
year-end prices of $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas and $57.65 per barrel for oil
in 2009. Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future production and
development costs based on year-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows.
Future income taxes were computed by applying the year-end statutory rate to the
excess of pre-tax cash inflows over the Companys tax basis in the associated
proved gas and oil properties after giving effect to permanent differences and
tax credits.

(5) DERIVATIVES AND RISK
MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed
to volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude
oil which impacts the predictability of its cash flows related to the sale of
natural gas and oil. These risks are managed by the Companys use of certain
derivative financial instruments.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
Companys derivative financial instruments consisted of price swaps,
costless-collars and basis swaps. A description of the Companys derivative
financial instruments is provided below:

Fixed price swaps  
The Company receives a
fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the
counterparty.
 
Floating price swaps 
The Company receives a
floating market price from the counterparty and pays a fixed price. 
 
Costless-collars  
Arrangements that
contain a fixed floor price (put) and a fixed ceiling price (call). If the
market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price,
the Company receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market
price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from
either party. 

Basis swaps 
Arrangements that
guarantee a price differential for natural gas from a specified delivery point.
The Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential
is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if
the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract.
  

GAAP requires that all
derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
and be measured at fair value. Under GAAP, certain criteria must be satisfied in
order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as
either a cash flow or a fair value hedge. Accounting for qualifying hedges
requires a derivatives gains and losses to be recorded either in earnings or as
a component of other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on derivatives that
are not elected for hedge accounting treatment or that do not meet hedge
accounting requirements are recorded in earnings. 

The Company utilizes
counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy
at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors
the credit ratings of these counterparties. Additionally, the Company performs
both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on
their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. However,
the events in the financial markets in recent years demonstrate there can be no
assurance that a counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the
Company.

Cash Flow Hedges
 
The reporting of gains
and losses on cash flow derivative hedging instruments depends on whether the
gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the
hedged item. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the derivative
hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized
in earnings during the period that the hedged transaction takes place. The
ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the derivative hedging
instrument recognized in earnings immediately.

―

As of December 31, 2011,
the Company recorded a gain in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
its hedging activities of $424.9 million net of a deferred income tax liability
of $276.2 million. The amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
will be relieved over time and recognized in the statement of operations as the
physical transactions being hedged occur. Assuming the market prices of natural
gas futures as of December 31, 2011 remain unchanged, the Company would expect
to transfer an aggregate after-tax net gain of approximately $303.2 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months.
Gains or losses from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are
reflected as adjustments to natural gas sales in the consolidated statements of
operations. Natural gas sales included a realized gain from settled contracts of
$320.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a realized gain
of $301.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Volatility in net
income, comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income may
occur in the future as a result of the Companys derivative activities.

The following tables
summarize the before tax effect of all cash flow hedges on the consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Other Derivative Contracts

Although the Companys
basis swaps meet the objective of managing commodity price exposure, these
trades are typically not entered into concurrent with the Companys derivative
instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and therefore do not generally
qualify for hedge accounting. Basis swap derivative instruments that do not
qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair
values under hedging assets, other assets and hedging liabilities, as applicable
and all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are
recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations as a
component of natural gas sales. 

As of December 31, 2011,
the Company had basis swaps on natural gas production that did not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment of 36.6 Bcf, 30.1 Bcf, and 9.1 Bcf for 2012, 2013,
and 2014, respectively.

The carrying values of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current
assets and current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets
approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. For debt and
derivative instruments, the following methods and assumptions were used to
estimate fair value:

Debt: The fair
values of the Companys senior notes were based on the market for the Companys
publicly-traded debt as determined based on yield of the Companys 7.5% Senior
Notes due 2018, which was 4.6% at December 31, 2011 and 5.2% at December 31,
2010. The carrying values of the borrowings under the Companys unsecured
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010 approximate fair
value.

Derivative
Instruments: The fair value of all derivative instruments is the amount at
which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The
amounts are based on quoted market prices, best estimates obtained from
counterparties and an option pricing model, when necessary, for price option
contracts.

Table of Contents

GAAP establishes a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of
three broad levels: 

Level 1 valuations - 
Consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority.

Level 2 valuations - 
Consist of quoted market information for the calculation of fair
market value. 

Level 3 valuations - 
Consist of internal
estimates and have the lowest priority.
 
Pursuant to GAAP, the
Company has classified its derivatives into these levels depending upon the data
utilized to determine their fair values. The Companys Level 2 fair value
measurements include fixed-price and floating-price swaps and are estimated
using internal discounted cash flow calculations using the NYMEX futures index.
The Companys Level 3 fair value measurements include costless-collars and basis
swaps. The Companys costless-collars are valued using the Black-Scholes model,
an industry standard option valuation model, and takes into account inputs such
as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including
assumptions of the NYMEX futures index, interest rates, volatility and credit
worthiness. The Companys basis swaps are estimated using internal discounted
cash flow calculations based upon forward commodity price curves.

Issuance of Senior Notes and
Subsidiary Guarantees  

In January 2008, the
Company completed an offering of $600 million Senior Notes with a coupon rate of
7.5% (7.5% Senior Notes), a maturity in February 2018 and semi-annual interest
payments. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture, holders have
the option to require the Company to purchase all or any portion of the notes at
a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest before the change of control date.

Table of Contents

The indentures governing
the Companys senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict
the ability of the Company and/or its subsidiaries ability to incur liens, to
engage in sale and leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell
assets.  All of the Companys senior notes are currently guaranteed by its
subsidiaries, SEECO, Inc. (SEECO), Southwestern Energy Production Company
(SEPCO) and Southwestern Energy Services Company (SES).  If no default
or event of default has occurred and is continuing, these guarantees will be
released (i) automatically upon any sale, exchange or transfer of all of the
Companys equity interests in the guarantor; (ii) automatically upon the
liquidation and dissolution of a guarantor; (iii) following delivery of notice
to the trustee of the release of the guarantor of its obligations under the
Companys credit facility; and (iv) upon legal or covenant defeasance or other
satisfaction of the obligations under the notes.  

Please refer to Note 15,
Condensed Consolidating Financial Information in this Form 10-K for additional
information.

Credit Facility  

In February 2011, the
Company amended and restated its unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing
the borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date to
February 2016 (Credit Facility).  The amount available under the Credit
Facility may be increased to $2.0 billion at any time upon the Companys
agreement with its existing or additional lenders. The Company had $671.5 and
$421.2 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility at December 31,
2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The interest rate on the amended
credit facility is calculated based upon our debt rating and is currently 200
basis points over the current London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and was 200
basis points over LIBOR at December 31, 2011. The Credit Facility is guaranteed
by the Companys subsidiary, SEECO.  The Credit Facility requires
additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not
satisfied.  The revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose
certain restrictions on the Company. Under the credit agreement, the Company may
not issue total debt in excess of 60% of its total capital and must maintain a
ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
to interest expense of 3.5 or above. The
terms of the Credit Facility also include covenants that restrict the ability of
the Company and its material subsidiaries to merge, consolidate or sell all or
substantially all of their assets, restrict the ability of the Company and its
subsidiaries to incur liens and restrict the ability of the Companys
subsidiaries to incur indebtedness.  At December 31, 2011, the
Companys capital structure consisted of 25% debt and 75% equity and it was in
compliance with the covenants of its debt agreements.  While the Company
believes all of the lenders under the Credit Facility have the ability to
provide funds, it cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its
obligation under the facility. 

Interest Payments

Total cash interest
payments made by the Company were $64.8 million in 2011, $57.0 million in 2010
and $56.7 million in 2009. 

(8) COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

Operating Commitments and
Contingencies

The Company has
commitments to third parties for demand transportation charges. At December 31,
2011, future payments under non-cancelable demand charges are approximately
$212.2 million in 2012, $218.8 million in 2013, $234.3 million in 2014, $233.7
million in 2015, $236.2 million in 2016 and $960.5 million thereafter. 

Southwestern leases 14
drilling rigs and equipment for its E&P operations under leases that expire
on January 1, 2015. The Companys current aggregate annual payment under the
leases is approximately $19.4 million. The lease payments for the drilling rigs
and equipment, as well as other operating expenses for the Companys drilling
operations, are capitalized to natural gas and oil properties and are partially
offset by billings to third-party working interest owners for their share of rig
day-rate charges.
 
The Company leases
compressors, aircraft, vehicles, office space and equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases expiring through 2019.  At December 31, 2011, future
minimum payments under these non-cancelable leases accounted for as operating
leases are approximately $69.9 million in 2012, $65.0 million in 2013, $57.7
million in 2014, $33.5 million in 2015, $25.9 million in 2016 and $16.2 million
thereafter. The Company also has commitments for compression services related to
its Midstream Services and E&P segments. At December 31, 2011, future
minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements are approximately $42.1
million in 2012, $30.0 million in 2013, $15.7 million in 2014, $9.6 million in
2015, $8.0 million in 2016 and $1.7 million thereafter.

During 2011, SES entered
into a number of short and long term firm transportation service and gathering
agreements in support of our growing Marcellus Shale operations in Pennsylvania.
In March 2011, SES entered into a precedent agreement with Millennium Pipeline
Company, L.L.C. pursuant to which it will enter into short and long term
firm natural gas transportation services on Millenniums existing system and
expansions of the system are expected to be in-service by late 2012 and late
2013.  In June 2011, SES entered into a long term agreement with Bluestone
Gathering, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTE Energy Company, pursuant to which
Bluestone Gathering will build and operate a natural gas gathering system in
Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania and Broome County, New York, and provide
gathering services to SES in support of a portion of our future Marcellus Shale
natural gas production.  The projected in-service date for the gathering
system is expected to be during the third quarter of 2012.  SES also
executed firm transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
(TGP) that increase our ability to move its Marcellus Shale natural gas
production in the short term to market as well as a precedent agreement for an
expansion project with a projected in-service date of November 2013 pursuant to
which SES has subscribed for 100,000 Dekatherm/day of capacity.  TGPs
expansion project will expand its 300 Line in Pennsylvania to provide natural
gas transportation from the Marcellus Shale supply area to existing delivery
points on the TGP system.  TGP filed a certificate application for the
project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in late 2011. Pending
regulatory approvals, construction would begin in 2013, with a November 1, 2013
in-service date.   

We have provided certain
guarantees of a portion of SESs obligations under these agreements.  As of
December 31, 2011, SESs obligations for demand and similar charges under the
firm transportation agreements totaled approximately $2.1 billion and we
currently have not recognized any guarantee obligations with respect to the firm
transportation agreements and the gathering project and services.  

On October 6, 2011, the
Companys subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Production Company (SEPCO), entered
into a 15-year agreement with a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners for
the construction of a gathering system in Susquehanna and Lackawanna counties in
Pennsylvania, which once constructed is expected to have a delivery capacity of
275,000 Dekatherm/day.

In the first quarter of
2010, the Company was awarded exclusive licenses by the Province of New
Brunswick in Canada to conduct an exploration program covering approximately 2.5
million acres in the province. The licenses require the Company to make certain
capital investments in New Brunswick of approximately $47 million Canadian
dollars (CAD) in the aggregate over a three year period. In order to obtain
the licenses, the Company provided promissory notes payable on demand to the
Minister of Finance of the Province of New Brunswick with an aggregate principal
amount of CAD $44.5 million. The promissory notes secure the Company's capital
expenditure obligations under the licenses and are returnable to the Company to
the extent the Company performs such obligations. If the Company fails to fully
perform, the Minister of Finance may retain a portion of the applicable
promissory notes in an amount equal to any deficiency. The Company commenced its
Canada exploration program in 2010 and, as of December 31, 2011 had invested CAD
$28.5 million in New Brunswick.  No liability has been recognized in
connection with the promissory notes due to the Companys investments in New
Brunswick as of December 31, 2011 and its future investment plans.

Environmental Risk

The Company is subject
to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when
it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can
be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other
compliance related costs will not have a material effect on the financial
position or reported results of operations of the Company.

Litigation

In February 2009, SEPCO was added as a defendant in a Third
Amended Petition in the matter of Tovah Energy, LLC and Toby Berry-Helfand v.
David Michael Grimes, et, al.  In the Sixth Amended Petition, filed in July
2010, in the 273rd District Court in Shelby County, Texas (collectively, the
Sixth Petition), plaintiff alleged that, in 2005, they provided SEPCO with
proprietary data regarding two prospects in the James Lime formation pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement and that SEPCO refused to return the proprietary
data to the plaintiff, subsequently acquired leases based upon such proprietary
data and profited therefrom.  Among other things, the plaintiffs
allegations in the Sixth Petition included various statutory and common law
claims, including, but not limited to claims of misappropriation of trade
secrets, violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, breach of fiduciary duty
and confidential relationships, various fraud based claims and breach of
contract, including a claim of breach of a purported right of first refusal on
all interests acquired by SEPCO between February 15, 2005 and February 15, 2006.
 In the Sixth Petition, plaintiff sought actual damages of over $55 million
as well as other remedies, including special damages and punitive damages of
four times the amount of actual damages established at trial.

Table of Contents
Immediately before the commencement of the trial in November 2010,
plaintiff was permitted, over SEPCOs objections, to file a Seventh Amended
Petition claiming actual damages of $46 million and also seeking the equitable
remedy of disgorgement of all profits for the misappropriation of trade secrets
and the breach of fiduciary duty claims. In December 2010, the jury found in
favor of the plaintiff with respect to all of the statutory and common law
claims and awarded $11.4 million in compensatory damages. The jury did not,
however, award the plaintiff any special, punitive or other damages. In
addition, the jury separately determined that SEPCOs profits for purposes of
disgorgement were $381.5 million. This profit determination does not constitute
a judgment or an award. The plaintiffs entitlement to disgorgement of profits
as an equitable remedy will be determined by the judge and it is within the
judges discretion to award none, some or all the amount of profit to the
plaintiff.  On December 31, 2010, the plaintiff filed a motion to enter the
judgment based on the jurys verdict.  On February 11, 2011, SEPCO filed a
motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to disregard
certain findings.  On March 11, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended motion
for judgment and intervenor filed its motion for judgment seeking not only the
monetary damages and the profits determined by the jury but also seeking, as a
new remedy, a constructive trust for profits from 143 wells as well as future
drilling and sales of properties in the prospect areas.  A hearing on the
post-verdict motions was held on March 14, 2011.  At the suggestion of the
judge, all parties voluntarily agreed to participate in non-binding mediation
efforts.  The mediation occurred on April 6, 2011 and was unsuccessful. On
June 6, 2011, SEPCO received by mail a letter dated June 2, 2011 from the judge,
in which he made certain rulings with respect to the post-verdict motions and
responses filed by the parties. In his rulings, the judge denied SEPCOs motion
for judgment, judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to disregard certain
findings. Plaintiffs and intervenors claim for a constructive trust was denied
but the judge ruled that plaintiff and intervenor shall recover from SEPCO $11.4
million and a reasonable attorneys fee of 40% of the total damages awarded and
are entitled to recover on their claim for disgorgement.  The judge
instructed that SEPCO calculate the profit on the designated wells for each
respective period.  SEPCO performed the calculation and provided it to the
judge in June 2011.  On July 5, 2011, plaintiff and intervenor filed a
letter with the court raising objections to the accounting provided by SEPCO, to
which SEPCO filed a response on July 11, 2011.  On July 12, 2011, the judge
sent a letter to the parties in which he ruled that after reviewing the parties
respective position letters, he was awarding $23.9 million in disgorgement
damages in favor of the plaintiff and intervenor.  In the July 12, 2011
letter, the judge instructed the plaintiff and intervenor to prepare a judgment
for his approval prior to July 21, 2011 consistent with his findings in his June
2, 2011 letter and the disgorgement award.  On August 24, 2011, a judgment
was entered pursuant to which plaintiff and intervenor are entitled to recover
approximately $11.4 million in actual damages and approximately $23.9 million in
disgorgement as well as prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees which currently
are estimated to be up to $8.9 million and all costs of court of the plaintiff
and intervenor.  On September 23, 2011, SEPCO filed a motion for a new
trial and on November 18, 2011 filed a notice of appeal.  On November 30,
2011, the court approved SEPCOs supersedeas bond in the amount of $14.1
million, which stays execution on the judgment pending appeal.  The bond
covers the $11.4 million judgment for actual damages, plus $1.3 million in
pre-judgment interest, $1.3 million in post-judgment interest (estimating two
years for the duration of appeal), and court costs.
The Company believes that SEPCO has a number of legal grounds for
appealing the judgment, all of which will be vigorously pursued.  Based on
the Company's understanding and judgment of the facts and merits of this case,
including appellate defenses, and after considering the advice of counsel, the
Company has determined that, although reasonably possible after exhaustion of
all appeals, an adverse final outcome to this lawsuit is not probable.  As
such, the Company has not accrued any amounts with respect to this lawsuit.
 If the plaintiff and intervenor were to ultimately prevail in the
appellate process, the Company currently estimates, based on the judgments to
date, that SEPCOs potential liability would be up to $44.2 million, including
interest and attorneys fees.  The Companys assessment may change in the
future due to occurrence of certain events, such as denied appeals, and such
re-assessment could lead to the determination that the potential liability is
probable and could be material to the Company's results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.
On February 20, 2012, the Company became aware that SEPCO was
named as a defendant in the matter of Gery Muncey v. Southwestern Energy
Production Company, et al filed in the District Court of San Augustine County in
Texas on January 31, 2012.  The plaintiff in this case is also the
intervenor in the Tovah Energy matter described above and alleges various claims
including fraud, misappropriation and breach of fiduciary duty that are
purported as independent of the claims alleged in the Tovah Energy matter but
arise from the substantially same circumstances involved in the Tovah Energy
matter.  The plaintiff is seeking value for various royalty and override
ownership interests in wells drilled, disgorgement of profits and punitive
damages.  The Company has not accrued any amounts with respect to this
lawsuit and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any potential liability
based on the Companys understanding and judgment of the facts and merits of
this case. 
In March 2010, the Companys subsidiary, SEECO, Inc., was served
with a subpoena from a federal grand jury in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Based
on the documents requested under the subpoena and subsequent discussions
described below, the Company believes the grand jury is investigating matters
involving approximately 27 horizontal wells operated by SEECO in Arkansas,
including whether appropriate leases or permits were obtained therefor and
whether royalties and other production attributable to federal lands have been
properly accounted for and paid.  The Company believes it has 

92 SWN




Table of Contents
fully complied
with all requests related to the federal subpoena and delivered its affidavit to
that effect. The Company and representatives of the Bureau of Land Management
and the U.S. Attorney have had discussions since the production of the
documents pursuant to the subpoena.  In January 2011, the Company
voluntarily produced additional materials informally requested by the government
arising from these discussions.  Although, to the Companys knowledge, no
proceeding in this matter has been initiated against SEECO, the Company cannot
predict whether or when one might be initiated. The Company intends to fully
comply with any further requests and to cooperate with any related
investigation. No assurance can be made as to the time or resources that will
need to be devoted to this inquiry or the impact of the final outcome of the
discussions or any related proceeding. 
We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that
have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
individually or in aggregate, such litigation, claims and proceedings will not
have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of
operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
managements view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect
becomes reasonably estimable. We accrue for such items when a liability is both
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Indemnifications

The Company provides
certain indemnifications in relation to dispositions of assets.  These
indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation or tax matters
existing at the date of disposition.  No liability has been recognized in
connection with these indemnifications.

$         1,174,381 

The net deferred tax
liability at December 31, 2011 was comprised of net long-term deferred income
tax liabilities of $1,586.8 million in addition to a net current deferred income
tax liability of $194.2 million.  The net deferred tax liability at
December 31, 2010 was comprised of net long-term deferred income tax liabilities
of $1,130.3 million, in addition to a net current deferred income tax liability
of $44.1 million.  In 2011, the Company
paid $0.8 million in state income taxes and paid $3.4 million in alternative
minimum taxes.  In 2010, the Company paid $0.4 million in state income
taxes and paid $14.0 million in alternative minimum taxes. The Companys net
operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2011 was $878.2 million and has
expiration dates of 2027 through 2031. The Company also had an alternative
minimum tax credit carryforward of $73.5 million and a statutory depletion
carryforward of $13.0 million at December 31, 2011.

Deferred tax assets
relating to tax benefits of employee stock option grants have been reduced to
reflect exercises in 2011. Some exercises resulted in tax deductions in excess
of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of the
grant (windfalls). Although these additional tax benefits or windfalls are
reflected in net operating loss carryforwards, pursuant to GAAP, the additional
tax benefit associated with the windfall is not recognized until the deduction
reduces taxes payable. Accordingly, since the tax benefit does not reduce our
current taxes payable in 2011 due to net operating loss carryforwards, these
windfall tax benefits are not reflected in our net operating losses in
deferred tax assets for 2011. Windfalls included in net operating loss
carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets for 2011 were $110.3
million.  The Company utilized a portion of its net operating loss
carryforward in 2010 based on its federal income tax return filing. Therefore,
an additional tax return benefit associated with the windfall was recognized in
2011.

As of December 31, 2011,
the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits.  The income tax years 2008
and 2009 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service resulting in no
changes to the Companys taxes. The income tax years 2009 to 2011 remain open to
examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject,
except for the 2009 federal tax return for which the examination is complete.


The Company has an
income tax net operating loss carryforward related to its Canadian operations of
$11.0 million, and has expiration dates of 2030 through 2031. The Company
assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient
future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax
asset associated with the Canadian net operating loss. Based on this assessment,
the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $2.0 million, as of December 31,
2011, to reflect that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset
will not be recognized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $0.5
million in 2010. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are increased.

(11) RETIREMENT AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS

401(k) Defined Contribution
Plan
 
The Company has a 401(k)
defined contribution plan covering eligible employees. The Company expensed $1.9
million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million of contribution expense in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Additionally, the Company capitalized $3.8 million, $4.2
million and $3.3 million of contributions in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of
the Companys natural gas and oil properties or directly related to the
construction of the Companys gathering systems.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans

Prior to January 1,
1998, the Company maintained a traditional defined benefit plan with benefits
payable based upon average final compensation and years of service.
 Effective January 1, 1998, the Company amended its pension plan to become
a cash balance plan on a prospective basis for its non-bargaining employees. A
cash balance plan provides benefits based upon a fixed percentage of an
employees annual compensation. The Companys funding policy is to contribute
amounts which are actuarially determined to provide the plans with sufficient
assets to meet future benefit payment requirements and which are tax
deductible.

The postretirement
benefit plan provides contributory health care and life insurance benefits.
Employees become eligible for these benefits if they meet age and service
requirements. Generally, the benefits paid are a stated percentage of medical
expenses reduced by deductibles and other coverages. 

Substantially all
employees are covered by the Companys defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans. The Company accounts for its defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans by recognizing the funded status of each
defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the
Companys balance sheet. In the event a plan is overfunded, the Company
recognizes an asset. Conversely, if a plan is underfunded, the Company
recognizes a liability.

The expected return on
plan assets for the various benefit plans is based upon a review of the
historical returns experienced, combined with the future expected returns based
upon the asset allocation strategy employed. The plans seek to achieve an
adequate return to fund the obligations in a manner consistent with the federal
standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and with a prudent
level of diversification.

The Companys overall
investment strategy is to provide an adequate pool of assets to support both the
long-term growth of plan assets and to ensure adequate liquidity exists for the
near-term benefit payment of obligations to participants, retirees and
beneficiaries. The Retirement Committee of the Companys Board of Directors
(Retirement Committee) administers the Companys pension plan assets. The
Retirement Committee believes long-term investment

performance is a function of asset-class
mix and restricts the composition of pension plan assets to a combination of
cash and cash equivalents, domestic equity markets, international equity markets
or investment grade fixed income assets.

The table below presents
the allocations targeted by the Retirement Committee and the actual
weighted-average asset allocation of the Companys pension plan at December 31,
2011, by asset category. The asset allocation targets are subject to change and
the Retirement Committee allows for its actual allocations to deviate from
target as a result of current and anticipated market conditions.  Plan
assets are periodically balanced whenever the allocation to any asset class
falls outside of the specified range.

The Companys pension
plan assets that are classified as Level 1 are due to the pension plans
investments comprising either cash or investments in open-ended mutual funds
which produce a daily net asset value that is validated with a sufficient level
of observable activity to support classification of the fair value measurement
as Level 1. The Companys Level 2 pension plan assets represent investments in
institutional funds.  These equity securities can be redeemed on demand but
are not actively traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are
based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers.  No
concentration of risk arising within or across categories of plan assets exists
due to any significant investments in a single entity, industry, country or
investment fund.

 (12) STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

The Southwestern Energy
Company 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was adopted in February 2004 and
approved by stockholders in May 2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the
compensation of officers, key employees and eligible non-employee directors of
the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2004 Plan replaced the Southwestern Energy
Company 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) and the Southwestern Energy
Company 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (2002 Plan) but did not affect prior
awards under those plans which remained valid and some of which are still
outstanding. The awards under the prior plans have been adjusted for stock
splits as permitted under such plans.

The 2004 Plan provides
for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, and shares of restricted stock
and restricted stock units to employees, officers and directors that in the
aggregate do not exceed 16,800,000 shares. The types of incentives that may be
awarded are comprehensive and are intended to enable the Companys board of
directors to structure the most appropriate incentives and to address changes in
income tax laws which may be enacted over the term of the 2004 Plan.

As initially adopted,
the 2000 Plan provided for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights,
shares of phantom stock, and shares of restricted stock to employees, officers
and directors that in the aggregate did not exceed 1,250,000 shares of common
stock. As initially adopted, the 2002 Plan provided for grants of options, stock
appreciation rights, shares of phantom stock and shares of restricted stock that
in the aggregate did not exceed 300,000 shares to employees who are not officers
or directors of the Company under provisions of Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Company may utilize
treasury shares, if available, or authorized but unissued shares when a stock
option is exercised or when restricted stock is granted.

The Company measures the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. All options are
issued at fair market value at the date of grant and expire seven years from the
date of grant for awards under the 2004 Plan and ten years from the date of
grant for awards under all other plans. Generally, stock options granted to
employees and directors vest ratably over three years from the grant date. The
Company issues shares of restricted stock to employees and directors which
generally vest over four years. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
individual grants with the exception of awards granted to participants who have
reached retirement age or will reach retirement age during the vesting period.
Restricted stock and stock options granted to participants on or after December
8, 2005 immediately vest upon death, disability or retirement (subject to a
minimum of five years of service).

The Company also
recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.7 million related to stock options in
2011, compared to deferred tax benefits of $1.7 million in 2010 and $1.4 million
in 2009. A total of $20.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
the Companys unvested stock option and restricted stock grants. This cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.


The fair value of stock
options is estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes valuation
model that uses the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table.
 Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys
common stock and other factors.  The Company uses historical data on
exercise of stock options, post vesting forfeitures and other factors to
estimate the expected term of the stock-based payments granted. The risk free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant.

Table of Contents

(13) SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Companys reportable
business segments have been identified based on the differences in products or
services provided. Revenues for the E&P segment are derived from the
production and sale of natural gas and crude oil. The Midstream Services segment
generates revenue through the marketing of both Company and third-party produced
natural gas volumes and through gathering fees associated with the
transportation of natural gas to market. 

Summarized financial
information for the Companys reportable segments is shown in the following
table.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note 1. Management evaluates the performance of its segments based
on operating income, defined as operating revenues less operating costs and
expenses. Income before income taxes, for the purpose of reconciling the
operating income amount shown below to consolidated income before income taxes,
is the sum of operating income, interest expense and other income (loss), net.
The Other column includes items not related to the Companys reportable
segments including real estate and corporate items.

(15) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

The Company is providing
condensed consolidating financial information for SEECO, SEPCO and SES, its
subsidiaries that are currently guarantors of the Companys registered public
debt, and for its other subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such debt. These
wholly owned subsidiary guarantors have jointly and severally, fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the Companys 7.35% Senior Notes and 7.125% Senior
Notes. The subsidiary guarantees (i) rank equally in right of payment with all
of the existing and future senior debt of the subsidiary guarantors; (ii) rank
senior to all of the existing and future subordinated debt of the subsidiary
guarantors; (iii) are effectively subordinated to any future secured obligations
of the subsidiary guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such obligations; and (iv) are structurally subordinated to all debt and other
obligations of the subsidiaries of the guarantors.  In the case of each
series of notes, if no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing, these guarantees will be released (i) automatically upon any sale,
exchange or transfer of all of the Companys equity interests in the guarantor;
(ii) automatically upon the liquidation and dissolution of a guarantor; (iii)
following delivery of notice to the trustee of the release of the guarantor of
its obligations under the Companys credit facility; and (iv) upon legal or
covenant defeasance or other satisfaction of the obligations under the
notes.

The Company has not
presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the
subsidiary guarantors because it believes that such financial and narrative
information would not provide any additional information that would be material
in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. The following condensed
consolidating financial information summarizes the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows for the Companys guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

We have performed an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
Exchange Act).  Our disclosure controls and procedures are the
controls and other procedures that we have designed to ensure that we record,
process, accumulate and communicate information to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and submission within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms. All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those determined to be
effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Based on the evaluation, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.  There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2011, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page 68 of this Form
10-K.

ITEM 9B. OTHER
INFORMATION

There was no information required to
be disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, that was not reported on such form.
