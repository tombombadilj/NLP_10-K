 In 2011, we produced 1.5 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills in Counce, Tennessee and
Valdosta, Georgia, and 1.0 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium at our mills in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88,000 acres of timberland located near our
Counce and Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements with third parties on approximately 279,000 acres of timberland. 
Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping
containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes and
wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.  Industry Overview 
According to the Fibre Box Association, the value of industry shipments of corrugated products was $26.1 billion in 2011.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize
freight costs. The U.S. corrugated products industry consists of approximately 575 companies and 1,245 plants. 
Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated
products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued to
produce corrugated products.  Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers, as well as from
recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak. The finished paper product is wound into
large rolls, which are slit to size as required and shipped to converters.  PCA Operations and Products 
Containerboard Mills  Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 20
lb. to 47 lb. Mill capacities described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper basis weights, and production can exceed estimated capacity if a higher-than-estimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced. All four of our mills have
completed an extensive independent review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer service.
 The following four paragraphs describe our containerboard mills annual practical maximum capacity, 2011 actual
production and production capabilities.  Counce.    Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of the
largest kraft linerboard mills in the United States. Its year-end 2011 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the American Forest and Paper Association (AF&PA), is 1,043,000 tons. In 2011, we produced 1,007,000 tons of
kraft linerboard on two paper machines at Counce. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard. 
Valdosta.    Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill. Its year-end 2011 annual estimated
production capacity, as reported to the AF&PA, is 556,000 tons. In 2011, our single paper machine at Valdosta produced 516,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces a range of basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb. 
Tomahawk.    Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills in the
United States. Its year-end 2011 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&PA, is 538,000 tons. In 2011, we produced 538,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper machines at Tomahawk. The Tomahawk mill produces
a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium. 
Filer City.    Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill. Its year-end 2011
annual estimated production capacity on three paper machines, as reported to the AF&PA is 438,000 tons. In 2011, we produced 438,000 tons of corrugating medium on three paper machines at Filer City. Filer City produces corrugating medium grades
ranging in basis weight from 20 lb. to 47 lb.

Corrugated Products  We operate 71 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, six regional graphic design centers, a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and
distribution centers. Of the 71 manufacturing facilities, 41 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers. The remaining 30 manufacturing facilities,
commonly called sheet plants, procure combined sheets (primarily produced at PCAs corrugated plants) and manufacture finished corrugated containers.  We have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part, serves a market
radius that typically averages 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick
turnaround items.  We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging. 
Timberland  We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 88,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills, which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 12 years remaining, on
average.  During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold approximately 800,000 acres of timberland. We currently have in place supply
agreements covering approximately 279,000 of the 800,000 acres sold. The majority of the acreage covered by supply agreements is located in close proximity to our Counce mill. 
PCA participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and is certified under the SFI sourcing standards. These standards are
aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. PCA is committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship
ethics.  Sales and Marketing  Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations who serve local and
regional accounts. We also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and
marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the graphic design centers. General marketing support is located at our
corporate headquarters.  Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to
our corrugated plants, to other domestic customers and to the export market. This group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all
containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.

Table of Contents
Distribution  Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Rail shipments typically represent from about 50% to 55% of the tons shipped and the remaining 45% to 50% is comprised of truck shipments.
Our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities.  Our corrugated products are delivered by truck
due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 miles radius. We use third-party warehouses for short-term storage of corrugated products. 
Customers  PCAs
corrugated products group sells to approximately 9,000 customers in over 17,000 locations. About two-thirds of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic
locations. The remaining one-third of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or those customers with a national presence. These customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United
States.  Major Raw Materials Used  Fiber supply.    Fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no
100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mill system has the capability to
shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use various types of virgin
and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is sold to our mills directly or through
trade agreements. During 2011, our containerboard mills consumed approximately 625,000 tons of recycled fiber, and our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 208,000 tons of recycled fiber. As a result, PCA was a net recycled fiber
buyer of 417,000 tons, or 17% of PCAs total fiber requirements.  Energy supply.    Energy at
PCAs four mills is obtained through purchased or self-generated fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, purchased wood waste and by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process, including black
liquor and wood waste. Each of PCAs mills self-generate process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and
also to generate electricity.  In 2011, PCAs four mills consumed about 41 million MMBTUs to produce both steam and
electricity. Of the 41 million MMBTUs consumed, about 62% was from mill generated by-products, and 38% was from purchased fuels. Of the 38% in purchased fuels, 34% was from coal, 28% from purchased wood waste, and 33% from natural gas.
 In 2011, our mills purchased approximately 9.0 million CkWh (hundred kilowatt hours) of electricity, or the equivalent
of 3.1 million MMBTUs. Approximately 45% of the electricity consumed by our four mills in 2011 was generated on-site.  In 2011, PCAs corrugated products plants consumed about 2.1 million MMBTUs of natural gas.  In October 2009, PCA announced major energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta linerboard mills, to significantly reduce fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and reduce fossil fuel
consumption at

these facilities. The projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at the Valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing
recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the Counce mill. We expect these projects to reduce our mill purchased fuels and electricity. 
Competition  According
to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 575 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,245 plants. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customers specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within
a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions. 
The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a
consolidated basis. These customers are often referred to as national or corporate accounts.  Corrugated products businesses
seek to differentiate themselves through pricing, quality, service, design and product innovation. We compete for both local and national account business, and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products. On a national level,
our primary competitors include International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by Koch Industries, Inc.) and Rock-Tenn Company. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent
converters.  Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our own
corrugated products plants are a number of large, diversified paper companies, including International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific and Rock-Tenn Company, as well as other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally considered a
commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.  Employees 
As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 8,300 employees. Approximately 2,500 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,800 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and the
International Association of Machinists (IAM).  Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the existing labor
agreements at our containerboard mills covering USW-represented employees (88% of mill hourly workforce) were extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at our mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and June 2015.
Agreements with other union mill employees (12% of mill hourly workforce) expire between June 2012 and October 2014. Based on an agreement reached with the USW in April 2009, the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering USW represented
employees was extended up to five years. Contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between February 2012 and December 2017. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently
expired or are expiring in the near future.  During 2011, we experienced no work stoppages and have experienced no instances
of significant work stoppages in the five years prior to 2011. We believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees. 
Environmental Matters 
Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations. We commit substantial resources to
maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting us are:  1.   Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)  2.   Clean Water Act (CWA) 
  7 


Table of Contents
3.   Clean Air Act (CAA) 
4.   The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA) 
5.   Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)  6.   Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)  We believe that we are currently
in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other
environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we spent approximately $26.0 million, $24.6 million and $26.4 million, respectively, to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws.
Additionally, total capital costs for environmental matters were $2.8 million, $1.1 million and $0.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We currently estimate 2012 environmental capital expenditures will be
$1.0 million. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial
condition.  In 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) published the Boiler MACT
regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. These regulations were vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2007. The EPA proposed final regulations
in March 2011, which would require compliance in 2014. During 2011, the EPA determined that it would reconsider certain provisions of the Boiler MACT regulations and, in December 2011, the EPA published proposed rules containing changes to the March
2011 rules. The EPA may make further changes to the proposed rules. PCA is currently assessing the impact of these regulations on its operations which could require significant modifications to certain of PCAs boilers. Due to the complexity of
these regulations, and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations, the timing and amount of expenditures to be made by PCA are uncertain, but could be significant during the period before compliance
is required.  As is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation
of soil or groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2011, remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature. As of
December 31, 2011, we maintained an environmental reserve of $10.5 million, which includes funds relating to on-site landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Of the $10.5 million reserve,
$5.1 million is reserved for our landfill obligations, which are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. We believe these reserves are
adequate.  We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including
liability for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us. 
On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc., sold its
containerboard and corrugated products business to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity investment firm. As a part of the April 12, 1999 transaction, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill. 
As of the date of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the
$10.5 million accrued as of December 31, 2011 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at
the federal level, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so, what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental
compliance costs, through caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities, which may be material. However, climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of
renewable energy is encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. Our recently-completed major energy
projects at the Counce and Valdosta linerboard mills are expected to significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels at those facilities, while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities. While we believe we are well-positioned to
take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected.

Industry Risks  Industry Cyclicality  Imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell containerboard and corrugated products, and as a result, could result
in lower selling prices and earnings.  The price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available
for sale in the market exceeds the demand. The demand for containerboard is driven by market needs for containerboard in the United States and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers. Market needs or demand are driven by both global and
U.S. business conditions. If supply exceeds demand, prices for containerboard and corrugated products could decline, resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations. 
Competition  The intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry could result in
downward pressure on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations.  The
containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly competitive, with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position. Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify
price competition. The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as other factors including innovation, design, quality and service. To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with
respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected. Our products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal. The
intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products, both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.  Company Risks  Cost of Fiber  An increase in the cost of
fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings.  PCA has supply agreements at market prices for
wood fiber to be consumed at our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills on approximately 279,000 acres of timberland. In addition to these supply agreements, PCA also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices.
 PCA purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills. PCA currently purchases, net of recycled
fiber generated at its box plants, approximately 400,000 to 450,000 tons of recycled fiber per year. The amount of recycled fiber purchased each year depends on the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber as the company attempts to minimize
total fiber costs.  The market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. In addition, the increase in
demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. These periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price
volatility. Periods of above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, which could result in lower or volatile earnings. 
Cost of Purchased Energy and Chemicals  An increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher
manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings.  PCA has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in
its manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural gas and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past. In addition, costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing have
risen. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If energy and chemical prices rise, our production costs and transportation costs will increase, which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced
earnings.

Table of Contents
Material Disruption of Manufacturing  A material disruption at one of our
manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition.  Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities, particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease operations
unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages; prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; fire; explosion of a boiler; labor difficulties; natural catastrophes; terrorism;
governmental regulations; and other operational problems. These events could cause us to be unable to service our customers or lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.  Environmental Matters  PCA may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations. 
We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and
water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws. See
Item 1. Business  Environmental Matters for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years. In addition, environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw
materials and purchased energy. Although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing, these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or
changes in existing laws or regulations, which might require additional significant environmental expenditures.  Investment Risks
 Market Price of our Common Stock  The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause
the value of your investment to decline.  Securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price
declines and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could
be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly.  General Risks  Economic Conditions  Our earnings and cash
generated from operations could be significantly lower if a severe downturn in the U.S. economy occurs again.  Our
operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the U.S. economy, and to a lesser extent, by global economic conditions. The significant downturn in the U.S. economy impacted our industry and PCA in late 2008 and
continued into 2009, lowering the demand for our products and our mill production. This lower demand and production reduced our revenues, increased our unit production costs, and lowered our earnings and our cash generated from operations during
those periods. Demand for our products and PCAs mill production improved during 2010 and continued to improve in 2011. It is unknown whether economic conditions will again deteriorate or continue to improve. In the event that economic
conditions deteriorate, our operating and financial performance will be adversely impacted. Lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our ability to fund operations, capital requirements, and common stock dividend payments, and another
prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt covenants.

 We currently own our four containerboard mills and 44 of our corrugated manufacturing operations (37
corrugated plants and seven sheet plants). We also own one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which includes sales offices and woodlands management offices. These sales offices and woodlands management offices generally have one to four
employees and serve as administrative offices. PCA leases the space for four corrugated plants, 23 sheet plants, six regional design centers, and numerous other distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment in these leased
facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by PCA, except for forklifts and other rolling stock which are generally leased. 
We lease the cutting rights to approximately 88,000 acres of timberland located near our Valdosta mill (77,000 acres) and
our Counce mill (11,000 acres). On average, these cutting rights agreements have terms with approximately 12 years remaining.  Our corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois. The headquarters facility is leased for the next ten years with provisions for two additional five year lease extensions. 
 


Item 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  During September and October 2010, PCA and eight other U.S. and Canadian containerboard producers were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging violations of the Sherman Act. The lawsuits have been consolidated in a single complaint under the caption Kleen Products LLC v Packaging Corp. of America et al. The consolidated complaint
alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply of containerboard, and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of containerboard products during the period from August 2005 to the time of
filing of the complaints. The complaint was filed as a purported class action suit on behalf of all purchasers of containerboard products during such period. The complaint seeks treble damages and costs, including attorneys fees. The
defendants motions to dismiss the complaint were denied by the court in April 2011. PCA believes the allegations are without merit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously. However, as the lawsuit is in the early stages of discovery, PCA is
unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses.  PCA is a party to various other
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these
legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Stockholders  As of February 17, 2012, there were 89 holders of record of our common stock.  Dividend
Policy  PCA expects to continue to pay regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance as to the timing or level of
future dividend payments because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.  On February
22, 2011, PCA announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend on its company stock from an annual payout of $0.60 per share to $0.80 per share. The first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share was paid to shareholders on April 15, 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
The following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report.  Overview 
PCA is the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the United States, based on production capacity. We
operate four containerboard mills and 71 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the United States. Approximately 80% of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants. The
remaining 20% is sold to domestic customers or the export market. We produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We
also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging.  In analyzing our operating performance, we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results: 
 


 

 
 containerboard and corrugated products demand;   


 

 
 corrugated products and containerboard pricing and mix; 
  17 


Table of Contents


 

 
 cost trends and volatility for our major costs, including wood and recycled fiber, purchased fuels, electricity, labor and fringe benefits and
transportation costs; and

 cash flow from operations and capital expenditures.  Historically, supply and demand, as well as industry-wide inventory levels, have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products. In addition to U.S. shipments, approximately 10% of
domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries.  The market for containerboard and
corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy grew at a slower rate in 2011 than it did in 2010 as real GDP increased 1.7% in 2011 compared to a 3.0% increase in 2010 as reported by the U. S.
Department of Commerce. Industry-wide corrugated products shipments increased 0.5% in 2011 compared to 2010 and containerboard production was 0.3% higher than in 2010 as reported by industry trade publications. PCA experienced improvement in demand
that exceeded the industry average, and for the year, our corrugated products shipments were up 5.0% compared to 2010, and containerboard production increased from 2,443,000 tons to 2,499,000 tons, or up 2.3% setting a new record for annual
production. Industry containerboard inventories at the end of December 2011 were 2.35 million tons, more than 65,000 tons below the ten-year average for year-ending levels. 
Average prices for containerboard and corrugated products were higher during 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting a full year of the two
published price increases that occurred in 2010. During 2011 the published price in industry trade publications for containerboard did not change.  Increased pricing and improved demand favorably impacted PCAs 2011 earnings compared to 2010. However, they were offset by higher costs for transportation, chemicals, fiber, labor and other input
items. Published recycled fiber costs in 2011 increased, on average, approximately 20% compared to 2010. At the end of 2011, published recycled fiber prices did decline and entered 2012 below the 2011 average price. Wood fiber costs in 2011 were
essentially unchanged from 2010 levels as weather conditions in the U.S. South were favorable for access to wood fiber. Transportation costs increased 9% from prior year levels as average diesel prices, as reported by the U.S. Department of
Energy, increased 28% from the 2010 average price. Labor related costs increased reflecting annual merit increases and increased costs for medical insurance and workers compensation. Our prices paid for purchased fuels and electricity each
averaged approximately 5% higher for 2011 compared to the 2010 average.  As disclosed in Note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements, PCA is a producer of black liquor, which is considered an alternative fuel when mixed with diesel, making the black liquor an alternative fuel eligible for a $0.50 per gallon refundable alternative fuel mixture tax credit
through December 31, 2009. In an IRS memorandum released during the second quarter of 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor also qualifies for the taxable cellulosic biofuel producer credit of $1.01 per gallon of biofuel produced in 2009.
In a subsequent memorandum, the IRS concluded that a black liquor producer may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor (the same gallon of
fuel cannot receive both credits, but different gallons of fuel can be claimed as either the alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit). PCA received the required cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in
September 2010.  Prior to the IRSs memoranda and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credits, PCA had
recorded all tax credits resulting from black liquor production before December 31, 2009 as alternative fuel mixture tax credits, resulting in $171.3 million in income in 2009 and an additional $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. Based
upon both IRS memoranda and the 2010 guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit, PCA analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture
credit, or claiming a combination of the two credits for 2009. For the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009, PCA claimed about two-thirds of the gallons as cellulosic biofuel producer credits and about one-third of the gallons as
alternative fuel mixture credits, resulting in additional income of $38.5 million in 2010 and a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $102.0 million. This 
  18 


Table of Contents

reserve relates to uncertainty concerning the proprietary biofuel process at the Companys Filer City corrugating medium mill. Due to the unique and proprietary nature of the Filer City mill
process, IRS guidelines do not specifically address the process and uncertainty exists. As a result, the Company recorded a $102.0 million reserve for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As of December 31,
2011, including the $102.0 million recorded as an uncertain tax position under ASC 740, PCA had as much as $167.5 million of tax credits to be used to offset future tax payments. The cellulosic biofuel producer credit is a taxable credit.
However, the laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit are not completely defined. The IRS has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability. PCA believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not
subject the Company to federal or state income taxes on such benefits. If it is determined that any of the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to taxation, PCA will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its net
income. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company received notification that the IRS will begin its review of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in the 2009 federal income tax return, and such review is under way. 
On February 3, 2012, PCA amended its 2009 tax return to reflect a change in claimed gallons between the alternative fuel mixture credits
and the cellulosic biofuel producer credits. This change is expected to result in a first quarter 2012 non-cash, after-tax charge of $23 million.  Excluding charges of $4.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for asset disposals related to major energy projects and income of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share, for an adjustment related to medical benefits
reserves, we earned net income of $161.8 million ($1.61 per diluted share) for the full year of 2011. This compares with $166.3 million ($1.62 per diluted share) for the comparable period in 2010, excluding the income impact of the tax
credits noted above of $47.7 million ($0.46 per share) and charges of $8.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) for asset disposals related to major energy projects and other assets no longer in service and facility closure costs. Management excludes
the above items and uses these measures to focus on PCAs on-going operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present
operating results. Reconciliations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP are included elsewhere in Item 7 under Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts. 
In the first quarter of 2012, our corrugated products shipments should be higher with four additional workdays compared to the fourth
quarter of 2011, and we also expect a full quarters earnings benefit from our major energy projects. We expect normal first quarter cost increases from colder weather, annual maintenance outages at our Counce and Valdosta mills, timing related
employee benefits, a higher tax rate and pension expense. Average export containerboard prices are expected to be lower reflecting the full impact of fourth quarter price changes. Considering all of these items we expect first quarter earnings,
excluding special items (including the non-cash charge described above), to be approximately equal to reported earnings of $0.40 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011.

 Net Sales  Net sales increased by $184.5 million, or 7.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010. Net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales
volumes of corrugated products and containerboard ($122.6 million) and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard ($61.9 million).  Total corrugated products volume sold increased 5.0% to 32.5 billion square feet in 2011 compared to 31.0 billion square feet in 2010. On a comparable shipment-per-workday basis, corrugated
products sales volume also increased 5.0% in 2011 versus 2010. Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year. Both 2011 and 2010 contained 251 workdays,
those days not falling on a weekend or holiday. Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 1.2% to 513,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 507,000 tons in 2010. 
Income from Operations  Income from operations increased by $87.3 million, or 47.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. As noted in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, PCA
received the cellulosic biofuel producer registration in September 2010. As a result, our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations
($96.0 million) in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the provision for income taxes ($135.5 million) in 2010. In addition, income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amount of
$9.2 million in 2010. Excluding special items (as detailed below under Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts), income from operations decreased $6.8 million for full year 2011. This decrease was
primarily attributable to increased costs for transportation ($20.5 million), chemicals ($16.7 million), labor ($13.4 million), recycled fiber ($10.0 million), medical and workers compensation ($8.9 million), depreciation ($8.1 million),
energy ($4.8 million), the impact of severe winter weather in first quarter 2011 ($3.5 million), legal services ($2.3 million), travel, entertainment and meetings ($1.9 million), warehousing requirements ($1.7 million), building repairs ($1.5
million), environmental expenses ($1.4 million) and other fringe benefits ($1.2 million). These increases were partially offset by increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard ($61.9 million) and higher sales volume
($29.4 million).

Table of Contents
Gross profit increased $9.7 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2011
from the year ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 21.9% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2010 to 20.7% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to cost
increases on a per unit basis described above.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $11.5 million, or 6.3%, for
the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of increased salary expense ($4.3 million) reflecting annual merit increases, fringe benefits ($1.3 million), warehouse costs related
to customer requirements ($1.7 million), travel and meeting costs ($1.6 million) and other increased costs which were individually insignificant.  Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $6.4 million, or 11.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to increased salary
and fringe benefit expenses ($4.0 million) and increased costs for professional services related to legal matters ($2.3 million).  Other expense, net, decreased $9.2 million, or 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to closure costs at
two facilities ($4.2 million) and costs related to the write-off of paper machine assets at Tomahawk ($2.8 million) in 2010 in addition to reduced fixed asset disposal costs ($1.6 million). 
Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes  Net interest expense decreased by $3.1 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of higher capitalized
interest ($2.2 million) related to the Counce and Valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. 
PCAs effective tax rate was 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and (34.2)% for the year ended December 31, 2010
due to the impact of recording the alternative fuel mixture tax credits in 2010. Excluding the impact of the tax credits, the 2010 effective tax rate would have been 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective tax rate varies from
the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% principally due to the impact of the alternative fuel mixture tax credits (in 2010), state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers deduction. PCA had no material changes to its
uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes, during 2011. In March 2011, the Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it will begin its review of the 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns in the second quarter
of 2011. This review is under way.  Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009

Net Sales 
Net sales increased by $288.0 million, or 13.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31,
2009. Net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of corrugated products and containerboard ($176.7 million) and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard ($111.3 million). 
Total corrugated products volume sold increased 7.2% to 31.0 billion square feet in 2010 compared to 28.9 billion square feet
in 2009. On a comparable shipment-per-workday basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 6.8% in 2010 from 2009. Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays
within the year. The larger percentage increase, on a total shipments basis, was due to the fact that 2010 had one more workday (251 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2009 (250 days). Containerboard sales volume
to external domestic and export customers increased 17.6% to 507,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 431,000 tons in 2009.  Income from Operations  Income from operations decreased by
$167.1 million, or 47.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. As noted in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, PCA received the cellulosic biofuel producer registration in September 2010. As a result,
our 2010 income from operations was reduced primarily due to reversing a portion of our 2009 alternative fuel mixture credits out of income from operations ($96.0 million) in order to claim cellulosic biofuel credits which were recorded in the
provision for income taxes ($135.5 million) in 2010. In addition, income from operations included alternative fuel mixture credits in the amounts of $168.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively, in 2009 and 2010. Excluding special
items (as detailed below under Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts), income from operations increased $99.4 million for full year 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales
prices of corrugated products and containerboard ($111.3 million), higher sales volume ($58.4 million) partially offset by increased costs for fiber ($47.8 million), transportation ($10.6 million), labor and fringe benefits
($7.8 million) and maintenance and building repairs ($7.3 million).  Gross profit increased $105.6 million, or
24.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 19.9% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2009 to 21.9% of net sales in the year ended
December 31, 2010 primarily due to the increases of sales prices and volume described previously.  Selling and
administrative expenses increased $9.0 million, or 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of increased salary expense ($6.1 million) including annual merit
increases, incentive compensation, and temporary labor, labor related benefits ($1.0 million), travel and meeting costs ($1.1 million) and broker commissions ($0.7 million). 
Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $3.5 million, or 6.4%, from the year ended December 31,
2009. The increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses ($2.3 million) and costs for professional services regarding legal, tax and audit matters ($1.2 million). 
Other expense, net, increased $5.4 million, or 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities ($4.2 million) and costs related to the write-off of paper machine assets at Tomahawk ($2.8 million), partially offset by reduced expenses related to
legal claims ($1.5 million).

Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes 
Net interest expense decreased by $3.2 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest ($3.9 million) related to the Counce and Valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.
 Due to the impact of recording the fuel tax credits, PCAs effective tax rate was (34.2%) for the year ended
December 31, 2010 and 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of the fuel tax credits, the effective tax rate would have been 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 36.3% for the same period in 2009.
The effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% principally due to the impact of the fuel tax credits, state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers deduction. PCA recorded a material change
in its uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes, of $102.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the amendment of the 2009 federal income tax return to claim gallons of alternative fuel produced at the Filer
City, Michigan mill. Due to the proprietary nature of the biofuel process at the Filer City mill, uncertainty as to total fuel gallons qualifying for the credit exists, which caused the additional reserve. Pending the timing and the outcome of the
IRS review that is currently under way, which is not determinable at this time, the reserve for uncertain tax positions could change significantly.  Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Operating Activities 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $345.5 million compared to
$349.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 1.3%. Net income, excluding the income from the tax credits (described in Note 16 to the financial statements included in this report) of
$47.7 million in 2010, was $158.0 million and $157.7 million, respectively, for 2011 and 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was higher by $7.7 million (primarily due to increased depreciation from the
recently-completed major energy projects) and requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by $14.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010, which increased net cash provided by operating activities. The change in operating assets and
liabilities was primarily due to an improvement in accounts receivable ($33.3 million) resulting from price increases in 2010 and favorable changes in inventory ($20.0 million) in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a 2010 build in inventory in
anticipation of the downtime related to the major energy project work completed in 2011. This was partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable ($26.1 million) and higher pension contributions ($6.9 million) in 2011 compared to 2010.
In addition, PCA utilized fewer alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer credits to reduce federal tax payments in 2011 than it did in 2010, resulting in higher cash taxes paid ($33.6 million) in 2011 compared to the same period in
2010. Cash requirements for operating activities are subject to PCAs operating needs, the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses, and seasonal fluctuations in its operations. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $349.9 million compared to
$306.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $43.8 million, or 14.3%. Net

income, excluding the income from the tax credits (described in Note 16 to the financial statements included in this report) of $47.7 million in 2010 and $171.3 million in 2009,
was $157.7 million and $94.6 million, respectively, for 2010 and 2009, an increase of $63.1 million that increased net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, more alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer
tax credits ($24.2 million) were used to reduce federal tax payments during 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, PCAs cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were $19.1 million. This was partially offset by higher
requirements for operating assets and liabilities ($51.6 million) driven by higher accounts receivable levels in 2010 as a result of both higher 2010 sales volumes and pricing. 
Investing Activities  Net cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $28.8 million, or 9.0%, to $350.1 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The
increase was primarily related to $57.3 million in corrugated products business acquisitions completed in 2011 and higher additions to other long-term assets of $10.4 million in 2011 compared to 2010. This was partially offset by lower additions to
property, plant and equipment of $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to reduced spending ($55.9 million) on the major energy optimization projects. 
Net cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $202.0 million, or 169.3%, to
$321.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily related to higher additions to property, plant and equipment of $206.0 million, which included $175.9 million for the major energy
optimization projects at our linerboard mills, during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Partially offsetting this increase was a $3.1 million acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2009 as
described in Note 18 to the financial statements.  As of December 31, 2011, PCA had commitments for general purpose
capital expenditures of $40.4 million. PCA believes that cash-on-hand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments.  Financing Activities  Net cash used for financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2011 was $35.6 million compared to $92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $57.2 million, or 61.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to $150.0 million of proceeds from
borrowing under a new term loan in October 2011 and $9.9 million in proceeds from the settlement of treasury locks received in February 2011, partially offset by higher repurchases of PCA common stock of $86.1 million, as well as higher
dividends paid of $14.2 million during 2011.  Net cash used for financing activities totaled $92.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $17.3 million, or 22.9%, compared to the same period in 2009. The difference was primarily attributable to repurchases of PCA common stock of $38.9 million during 2010, partially offset by
lower common stock dividends paid of $15.1 million and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6.5 million during 2010 compared to 2009.  On November 29, 2000, PCA established an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company, LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are
included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders initially established a
$150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the
creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRCs assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA. Credit available under the receivables credit

facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. On October 11, 2011, PCA amended the receivables credit facility
agreement which extended the termination date to October 11, 2014 and increased the borrowing availability from $150.0 million to $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, PCA had $91.0 million in additional borrowing capacity
available under this facility and $109.0 million of borrowings was outstanding.  On July 21, 2003, PCA offered to
qualified institutional investors $150.0 million of 4.375% senior notes which matured in 2008 and $400.0 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2013. On March 25, 2008, PCA refinanced the five-year notes, issuing
$150.0 million of 6.50% senior notes due March 15, 2018 through a registered public offering.  On
August 1, 2011, PCA entered into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate. The treasury rate will serve as a reference in determining the interest rate
applicable to the new debt securities the Company expects to issue in the future to refinance PCAs currently outstanding $400.0 million of senior notes that mature in 2013. At December 31, 2011, the Company had a notional value of
$400.0 million in an interest rate protection agreement outstanding that is expected to settle by the end of 2012.  On
October 11, 2011, PCA replaced its senior credit facility that was scheduled to terminate in April 2013 with a new senior credit facility that provides a $150.0 million term loan facility, which PCA fully borrowed, and a $250.0 million
revolving credit facility, including a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin that is determined based upon PCAs credit ratings. PCA is
required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loan of $3.8 million beginning March 31, 2012 through September 30, 2016, with the balance due at maturity. The new senior credit facility will terminate on October 11, 2016. PCA had no
borrowings and $14.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, resulting in $235.7 million in unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2011. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011 that would require disclosure under SEC FR-67, Disclosure in Managements Discussion and Analysis About
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.  Contractual Obligations

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million at December 31,
2011 and interest payments on debt outstanding. Based on interest rates in effect and long-term debt balances outstanding as of December 31, 2011, projected contractual interest payments would be approximately $37.1 million in 2012 and for
each future year. For the purpose of this disclosure, we have assumed that PCAs variable and fixed rate long-term debt would be replaced at maturity with similar long-term debt and similar interest rates. This disclosure does not attempt to
predict changes in interest rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for the impact of changes in interest rates on PCAs future cash flows. 
The operating lease commitments, capital commitments, purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on PCAs
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. See Notes 8 and 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information. PCA currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2011.
See Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.  As of December 31, 2011,
PCAs expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes $6.3 million of obligations for uncertain tax positions because PCA cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability. See
Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.  PCAs primary sources of
liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities, available borrowing capacity under PCAs revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under PCAs receivables credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, PCA had
$326.7 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities, net of the impact on this borrowing capacity of $14.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Currently, PCAs primary uses of cash are for
operations, capital expenditures, debt service and declared common stock dividends, which it expects to be able to fund from these sources.  The following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2011 for PCAs revolving credit facility, the receivables credit facility and the
senior notes:

 The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million at
December 31, 2011. It also excludes from the projected annual cash interest payments, the non-cash income from the annual amortization of the $22.8 million received in July 2003 and the non-cash expense from the annual amortization of the
$4.4 million paid in March 2008 to settle the treasury locks related to the 5 3/4% senior notes due 2013 and the 6 1/2% senior notes due 2018. The amortization is being recognized over the terms of the 5 3/4% senior notes due 2013 and the
6 1/2% senior notes due 2018 and is included in
interest expense, net.  The instruments governing PCAs indebtedness contain financial and
other covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:   


 

 
 enter into sale and leaseback transactions, 
  26 


Table of Contents


 

 
 incur liens,   


 

 
 incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level,   


 

 
 enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or 
 


 

 
 merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of PCA. 
These limitations could limit corporate and operating activities. 
In addition, PCA must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio under its senior revolving credit facility.
A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and/or prohibit PCA from drawing on the revolving credit
facility. Such acceleration may also constitute events of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility. At December 31, 2011, PCA was in compliance with these covenants. 
PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of $40.4 million in 2012, primarily for maintenance capital, cost reduction,
business growth and environmental compliance.  PCA believes that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand,
available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the
foreseeable future. As its debt or credit facilities become due, PCA will need to repay, extend or replace such facilities. Its ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which
are beyond PCAs control.  Environmental Matters  PCA is subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil
and groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting the Company are:   


 

 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA);   


 

 
 Clean Water Act (CWA);   


 

 
 Clean Air Act (CAA);   


 

 
 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA); 
 


 

 
 Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and   


 

 
 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  PCA believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, the Company has
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. The Company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and does not currently expect
that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we spent approximately $26.0 million, $24.6 million and $26.4 million,
respectively, to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. 
  27 


Table of Contents

Additionally, total capital costs for environmental matters were $2.8 million, $1.1 million and $0.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the Company currently
estimates 2012 environmental capital expenditures will be $1.0 million.  As is the case with any industrial operation,
PCA has, in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the federal
Superfund law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the Company currently owns or operates, former facilities and off-site facilities where the Company has disposed of hazardous substances. As
part of the sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal.
Pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.  In
2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) published the Boiler MACT regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. These regulations were vacated and remanded
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2007. The EPA proposed final regulations in March 2011, which would require compliance in 2014. During 2011, the EPA determined that it would reconsider certain provisions of the Boiler MACT
regulations and, in December 2011, the EPA published proposed rules containing changes to the March 2011 rules. The EPA may make further changes to the proposed rules. PCA is currently assessing the impact of these regulations on its operations
which could require significant modifications to certain of PCAs boilers. Due to the complexity of these regulations, and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations, the timing and amount of
expenditures to be made by PCA are uncertain, but could be significant during the period before compliance is required. 
Because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault, joint and
several, meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, PCA could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. From 1994 through 2011, remediation
costs at PCAs mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2011, PCA maintained an environmental reserve of $10.5 million relating to on-site landfills and surface impoundments as well as
ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. As of this filing, the Company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the $10.5 million accrued as of December 31, 2011 will have a material
impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  While legislation regarding the regulation of
greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so, what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions
could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities, which may be material. However, climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could
also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable
resources. Our energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta linerboard mills are expected to significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels at those facilities, while providing more efficient power generation at those facilities. While we
believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected. 
Critical Accounting Policies  Managements discussion and analysis of PCAs financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements 
  28 


Table of Contents

requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, PCA evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, environmental liabilities, stock based compensation, and
contingencies and litigation. PCA bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  PCA believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion on
the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  Accounts Receivable  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Customer Deductions  PCA evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial
obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), PCA records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be
collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection experience. If the Companys collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material
adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligations), PCAs estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount. 
The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts. Based on
PCAs experience, customer returns, allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of its gross selling price. Accordingly, the Company reserves 1.0% of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items. 
As of December 31, 2011, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was $1.9 million, compared to
$2.5 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded expense related to doubtful accounts of $0.1 million compared to income of $0.9 million recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2010. The income in 2010 of $0.9 million was primarily due to a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the low level of actual losses over the previous three years. For the year
ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded income of $0.9 million related to doubtful accounts compared to expense of $1.5 million in 2009. The decrease in bad debt expense of $2.4 million between 2009 and 2010 was primarily
due to a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to reflect the low level of actual losses over the previous three years and a $0.9 million decrease in expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy
protection.  Inventories  PCA records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The estimated market value
is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required. Raw materials, work in process and
finished goods valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method comprised 61% and 65% of inventories at current cost at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving
average cost. 
  29 


Table of Contents
Pension and Postretirement Benefits 
The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 715, Compensation  Retirement Benefits.  One of the principal assumptions used to
calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets
in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.  The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31. The rate of
compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by PCA based upon annual reviews.  For postretirement health care plan accounting, PCA reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption. 
Environmental Liabilities  PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense
over the useful life of the asset.  The potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities
recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, the Companys estimates may change. PCA believes that any additional costs
identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on its financial statements.  In
connection with the sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with off-site waste disposal prior
to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.  Revenue Recognition  PCA recognizes revenue as title to the products
is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of
these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale.  Impairment of
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end or sooner if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. 
  30 


Table of Contents
Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset may not be fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the assets (or group of assets) carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to fair value is required.  Stock-Based Compensation 
PCA measures and records stock-based compensation cost in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation  Stock
Compensation. Stock compensation cost includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2006, the effective date of ASC 718, and (b) compensation costs for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006. The grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718.  PCA recognizes compensation expense associated with option awards ratably over their vesting periods. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each
option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee
terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant.
 The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of PCAs common stock on the grant
date. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods. As PCAs Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of restricted stock upon an
employees retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age.  Income Taxes  PCAs annual tax rate is determined based on
income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the
financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate in the financial statements is different than the rate reported on PCAs tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and
some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Significant management judgments are required for the
following items:   


 

 
 Management reviews PCAs deferred tax assets for realizability. Valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more
likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision. 
 


 

 
 PCA establishes accruals for uncertain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that PCAs tax return positions are fully supported, PCA
believes that an uncertain tax position does not meet the recognition threshold of ASC 740, Income Taxes. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits,
the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return, case law and emerging legislation. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter, PCA
believes that the accruals for uncertain tax contingencies at December 31, 2011 reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies as of such date in accordance with uncertain tax positions under ASC 740.

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts 
Income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share excluding special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management
presents income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share excluding these special items to focus on PCAs on-going operations and assess its operating performance and believes that these measures provide useful information to
investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP for the years ended

(a)
Consists of energy project related disposals in 2011 and 2009. For 2010, consists of energy project related disposals ($6.2 million), plant closures ($4.2 million) and
other assets no longer in service ($2.8 million).  Item 7A.
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  PCA is exposed to the impact
of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks, but not for trading purposes. For a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities,
see Note 9 to PCAs consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in the report.  The interest rates on
approximately 68% of PCAs debt are fixed. A one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of $2.6 million
annually. In the event of a change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity
analysis assumes no changes in PCAs financial structure.

Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Controls and Procedures 
PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in PCAs filings under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to PCAs management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Prior to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of PCAs management,
including PCAs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCAs disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2011. The evaluation of PCAs disclosure
controls and procedures included a review of the controls objectives and design, PCAs implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report. Based on this evaluation, PCAs
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PCAs disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2011. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PCAs internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  PCAs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, PCAs internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate.  PCAs management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, PCAs management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2011, based on the specified criteria.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 Packaging Corporation of America 
Board of Directors and Stockholders  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Packaging Corporation of America at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Packaging Corporation of Americas internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Packaging Corporation of America  Board of
Directors and Stockholders  We have audited Packaging Corporation of Americas internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Packaging Corporation of
Americas management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  In our opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 21, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2011   


1.
NATURE OF BUSINESS 
Packaging Corporation of America (PCA or the Company) was incorporated on January 25,
1999. On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation (Pactiv), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no
operations from the date of incorporation on January 25, 1999 to April 11, 1999.  The Company is comprised of mills
and corrugated manufacturing operations. The mill operations (the Mills) consist of two kraft linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, and two medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and Tomahawk,
Wisconsin. The Mills transfer the majority of their containerboard produced to PCAs corrugated products plants. 
PCAs corrugated manufacturing operations consist of 71 plants, with 41 operating as combining operations, or corrugated plants, and
30 as sheet plants; a technical and development center, six graphic design centers and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in the continental United States. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and
medium into sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping containers, point-of-sale graphics packaging, point-of-purchase displays and other specialized packaging. Sheet plants purchase sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to
use in the finished corrugated products converting process. The corrugated manufacturing operations sell to diverse customers primarily in North America.  As of December 31, 2011, PCA had approximately 8,300 employees. Approximately 2,500 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5,800 were hourly. Approximately 75% of its hourly
employees are represented by unions. The majority of its unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and the International Association of Machinists (IAM). 
Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the existing labor agreements at PCAs containerboard mills covering
USW-represented employees (88% of mill hourly workforce) were extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at the Companys mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and June 2015. Agreements with other union mill
employees (12% of mill hourly workforce) expire between June 2012 and October 2014. Based on an agreement reached with the USW in April 2009, the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering USW represented employees was extended up to five
years. Contracts for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between February 2012 and December 2017. The Company is currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near
future.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of PCA include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company has one joint venture that is accounted
for under the equity method.  Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  F-8



Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity, when acquired, of three months or less.
Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market.  Accounts Receivable 
The collectibility of PCAs accounts receivable is based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer is
unable to meet its financial obligations to PCA (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to the Company to reduce the net recorded receivable to the
amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized based on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an
unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligations to the Company), the estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount. 
The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts. Based on
the Companys experience, customer returns, allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of gross selling price. Accordingly, PCA reserves 1.0% of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items. 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The
reserve for customer deductions of $3.1 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are also included as a reduction of the accounts receivable balance. 
Inventories  With the exception of inventories at several corrugated products plants acquired since 2004, raw materials, work in process and finished goods are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
cost method. Inventories at the acquired plants are valued at the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Supplies and materials are valued using a moving average cost. All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and
include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories valued using the LIFO method totaled $197.3 million and $199.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, compared to total inventory values (before the LIFO inventory reserve) of $324.0 million and $309.2 million for the same respective periods.  The components of inventories are as follows:

 The amount of interest capitalized related to construction in progress was $7.1 million,
$4.8 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Depreciation
is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under capital leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the useful life, if shorter. The following lives are
used for the various categories of assets:   








 Buildings and land improvements
  
 
5 to 40 years
  

 Machinery and equipment
  
 
3 to 25 years

 The amount of depreciation expense was $161.5 million, $154.0 million and $148.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Pursuant to the terms of an industrial revenue bond, title to certain property, plant and equipment was transferred to a municipal development authority in 2009 in order to receive a property tax
abatement. The title of these assets will revert back to PCA upon retirement or cancellation of the bond. The assets are included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption Property, plant and equipment, net as all risks and
rewards remain with the Company.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
The Company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily customer lists and relationships, covenants not to compete and goodwill,
based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists and relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from six to 40 years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements.  Goodwill, which amounted to $58.2 million and
$38.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is not being amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with 
  F-10



Table of Contents

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other. The Company performs the impairment test at year end or sooner if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. The Company concluded that no impairment
of goodwill existed at the time of the annual impairment tests in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  Other Long-Term Assets
 PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense
using the effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior credit facilities and senior notes, which range from five to ten years. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $2.6 million and $1.3 million as of December 31,
2011 and 2010, respectively.  PCA leases the cutting rights to approximately 88,000 acres of timberland and capitalizes
the annual lease payments and reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs are recorded as depletion when timber is harvested and used in PCAs business operations or sold to customers. Capitalized long-term lease costs were
$26.2 million and $24.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The amount of depletion expense was $0.04 million, $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.  PCA capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development of software which is used in its business
operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Net capitalized software costs were
$1.9 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Software amortization expense was $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant and
Equipment. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the assets (or group of assets) carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. The Company concluded that no impairment
of long-lived assets existed in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  Pension and Postretirement Benefits 
One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
designed to approximate the actual long term returns.  The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension
and postretirement cost reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31st of each year. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension
cost and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.  For postretirement health care plan accounting, the Company
reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Environmental Matters 
Environmental expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations from which no current or future
benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred. Environmental expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded for environmental
contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. These liabilities are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.  Asset Retirement Obligations  The Company accounts for its
retirement obligations related to its landfills under ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value
at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. 
Income Taxes  PCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon managements estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances. 
PCAs practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  PCA measures the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. It is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering
such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes the following hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:  Level 1  Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.  Level 2  Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
Level 3  Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require
the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.  The Company measures the fair value of money market funds based on
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. See Note 6 for information about PCAs pension plans assets measured at fair value and Note 11 for information about PCAs assets and liabilities measured
at fair value.  Planned Major Maintenance Activities 
The Company accounts for its planned major maintenance activities in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and
Equipment, using the deferral method. All maintenance costs incurred during the year are expensed in the year in which the maintenance activity occurs.

Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are
included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. In addition, the Company offers volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at
the time of the respective sale.  Research and Development 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was $12.5 million, $10.9 million and
$9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Interest Expense, Net
 Interest expense, net, includes interest income of $0.02 million, $0.04 million and $0.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and amortization of the net gain on treasury lock settlements in July 2003 and March 2008 of $1.8 million for each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
Trade Agreements  PCA regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs. These agreements are entered into with other producers on an annual basis, pursuant to which both parties
agree to ship an identical number of tons of containerboard to each other within the agreement period. These agreements lower transportation costs by allowing each partys containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other partys
closest corrugated products plant. PCA tracks each shipment to ensure that the other partys shipments to PCA match PCAs shipments to the other party during the agreement period. Such transfers are possible because containerboard is a
commodity product with no distinguishing product characteristics. These transactions are accounted for at carrying value, and revenue is not recorded as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an earnings process. The transactions are
recorded into inventory accounts, and no income is recorded until such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.  Segment Information  PCA is engaged in one line of business: the
integrated manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of total net sales. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  The Company records its derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The guidance requires the Company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or
liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of
the gain or loss is recognized in earnings.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

  F-13



Table of Contents

in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This ASU effectively defers only those changes in Update 2011-05 as discussed below that relate to the presentation of reclassification
adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income and gives the FASB additional time to redeliberate the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will comply with the provisions of ASU 2011-12 upon its adoption on January 1, 2012. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, Compensation  Retirement Benefits  Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic
715-80)  Disclosures about an Employers Participation in a Multiemployer Plan. The amendments in this update require that employers provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures which will provide users with more
detailed information about an employers involvement in multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefits plans. The provisions in this update are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011, with
early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance on December 31, 2011 did not have any impact on the Companys disclosures.  The FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)  Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. The
amendments in this update provide an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and
interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will comply with the provisions of ASU 2011-08 upon its adoption on January 1, 2012. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
The amendments in this ASU require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The provisions in this update
should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will comply with the additional provisions of ASU 2011-05
upon its adoption on January 1, 2012.  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic
820)  Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The amendments in this ASU clarify the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements,
which will improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)  When to Perform
Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts. This ASU modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For such reporting units,
an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2011 did not have any impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving
Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. This ASU requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820. ASU
2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers;
and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases,

sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. As of January 1, 2011, the Company has adopted all disclosure provision of this guidance. See Note 11 for additional information. 
Reclassifications  Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year balances to conform to the presentation of the current fiscal year.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term equity incentive plan, which allows for grants of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance awards to directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who engage in services for PCA. The Company has not granted any option awards since 2007. Restricted stock awards granted to
employees vest at the end of a four-year period, and stock awards granted to directors vest immediately. The plan, which will terminate on October 19, 2014, provides for the issuance of up to 8,550,000 shares of common stock over the life
of the plan. As of December 31, 2011, options and restricted stock for 7,659,255 shares have been granted, net of forfeitures. Forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock available to be granted at a future date.

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option
grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations.
Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. The fair value
of restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the grant date.  A summary
of the Companys stock option activity and related information follows:

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
In connection with the acquisition from Pactiv, PCA and Pactiv entered into a human resources agreement which, among
other items, granted PCA employees continued participation in the Pactiv pension plan for a period of up to five years following the closing of the acquisition for an agreed upon fee. 
Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv pension plan
in which PCA hourly employees had participated though December 31, 2002. The PCA pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced by
retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through December 31, 2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through December 31, 2002 for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

  F-17



Table of Contents
Effective May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a grandfathered pension plan for eligible salaried
employees who had previously participated in the Pactiv pension plan. The benefit formula for the new PCA pension plan for salaried employees is comparable to that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA plan uses career average base pay in the
benefit formula in lieu of final average base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced by retirement benefits earned
under the Pactiv plan through April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through April 30, 2004 for salaried employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan. 
PCA maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), which augments pension benefits for eligible executives earned
under the PCA pension plan for salaried employees. Benefits are determined using the same formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to counting career average base pay, the SERP also recognizes bonuses and any pay earned in excess of IRS
qualified plan compensation limits. Benefits earned under the SERP are reduced by benefits paid from the PCA salaried pension plan and any prior qualified pension and SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan. 
PCA previously maintained a separate SERP for its former CEO and current Executive Chairman which was paid out and terminated on
March 15, 2009. The terminated plan was replaced by a lower cost deferred compensation benefit plan.  PCA provides
certain medical benefits for retired salaried employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for certain hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan covers employees retiring from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had
at least 10 years of full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly employees, the postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is available according to the eligibility provisions in effect at the employees work
location. Per the human resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the liability relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA employees who had retired on or before April 12, 1999 or who were eligible to retire within two
years of that date. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan design for salaried employees incorporating annual dollar caps in determining the maximum amount of employer contributions made towards the total cost of postretirement
medical coverage. Effective January 1, 2012 Pactiv curtailed the availability of retiree medical coverage to any of its salaried retirees, and their enrolled spouses, who were 65 or older. This affected approximately 50 PCA salaried retirees
covered under Pactivs retiree medical plan. PCA permitted these retirees and covered spouses to elect medical coverage under PCAs retiree medical plan effective January 1, 2012.

 For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company expects to recognize in net periodic benefit cost
$6.0 million ($3.7 million net of tax) and $(0.4) million ($0.3 million net of tax) of prior service cost for pension and postretirement plans, respectively, and $4.9 million ($3.0 million net of tax) and $0.5 million
($0.3 million net of tax) of actuarial loss for pension and postretirement plans, respectively, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2011.

 The expected return on pension plan assets reflects the expected long-term rates of return for the
categories of investments currently held in the plan as well as anticipated returns for additional contributions made in the future. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan
investments.  The discount rate assumptions used to calculate the present value of pension and
postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31st. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by
the Company based upon annual reviews.  In determining net pension and postretirement benefit costs, the Company elected to
amortize prior service cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. A 10% corridor is used to determine the amount of the unrecognized net gain or loss to be
amortized. The excess, if any, of the unrecognized net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets is amortized over the average remaining service period until retirement for
active participants and included in the net periodic benefit cost.

 The Company makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient to fund its actuarially determined
costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). However, from time to time the Company may make discretionary contributions in excess of the required minimum amounts. PCA currently
expects to make pension contributions of $32.6 million and record pension plan expense of $36.0 million in 2012. 
The following are estimated benefit payments to be paid to current plan participants by year:

 The Company has two defined contribution benefit plans that cover all full-time salaried employees and
certain hourly employees at several of the Companys facilities. Employees can make voluntary contributions in accordance with the provisions of their respective plan. The Company made employer-matching contributions of $10.4 million,
$9.6 million and $9.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Effective
January 1, 2011, PCAs Board of Directors adopted a resolution designating the portion of the defined contribution plans investments held in the Companys stock, and any future employee or employer contribution invested in the
Companys stock, as investments in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Company uses the ESOP to provide the Companys matching contribution in the form of the Companys stock to the plan participants
(full-time salaried employees only). The Company expenses the

employer-matching contributions and charges dividends on shares held by the ESOP to retained earnings. Any shares of Company stock held by the ESOP are included in basic shares for
earnings-per-share computations. At December 31, 2011, the ESOP held 2.6 million shares of the Companys common stock. 
Salaried employees who are not participants in the grandfathered pension plan (generally those hired on or after April 12,
1999) receive a service-related Company retirement contribution to their defined contribution plan account in addition to any employer matching contribution. This contribution increases with years of service and ranges from 3% to 5% of base
pay. The Company expensed $3.9 million, $3.1 million and $2.8 million for this retirement contribution during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

 On July 21, 2003, PCA offered to qualified institutional investors $150.0 million of
4.375% senior notes which matured in 2008 and $400.0 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2013. On March 25, 2008, PCA refinanced the five-year notes, issuing $150.0 million of 6.50% senior notes due March 15, 2018
through a registered public offering.  On October 11, 2011, the Company replaced its senior credit facility that was
scheduled to terminate in April 2013 with a new senior credit facility that provides a $150.0 million term loan facility, which PCA fully borrowed, and a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of
credit. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin that is determined based upon PCAs credit ratings. The new senior credit facility will terminate on October 11, 2016. The Company had
no borrowings and $14.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, resulting in $235.7 million in unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2011. 
Also on October 11, 2011, PCA amended its existing receivables credit facility agreement which extended the termination date to
October 11, 2014 and increased the borrowing availability from $150.0 million to $200.0 million. The Company had $91.0 million in additional borrowing capacity available under this facility as of December 31, 2011. 
The instruments governing PCAs indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its
subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets. The senior credit facility also requires PCA to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. A failure to comply with these
restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and/or prohibit the Company from drawing on the senior credit facility. Such an acceleration may also constitute an event of
default under the senior notes indenture and the receivables credit facility. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

 As of December 31, 2011, annual principal maturities for debt, excluding unamortized debt discount,
are: $15.0 million (2012), $415.0 million (2013), $124.0 million (2014), $15.0 million (2015), $90.0 million (2016) and $150.0 million (2017 and after).  Interest payments in connection with the Companys debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, amounted to $35.2 million, $35.3 million, and
$35.7 million, respectively.  PCA has an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable that
is accounted for as a secured borrowing under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. To effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC (PCC), which in turn
formed a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company, LLC (PRC), for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $200.0 million receivables-backed revolving
credit facility (Receivables Credit Facility) through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are solely the property of PRC. In the event of liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC
would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRCs assets prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may
not be available at all times. At December 31, 2011, $109.0 million was outstanding and included in Long  term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Substantially all accounts receivable at December 31, 2011
have been sold to PRC and are included in Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions on the consolidated balance sheet. The highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit
facility during 2011 was $109.0 million.  A summary of the Companys drawings under revolving credit facilities,
including the impact of $14.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, as of December 31, 2011 follows:

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
Hedging Strategy  PCA is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing operations. When appropriate, the Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The
primary risks managed by using derivative financial instruments are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks. PCA does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  F-25



Table of Contents
Interest Rate Risk 
The Company has historically used treasury lock derivative instruments to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing
interest rates. On June 12, 2003 and January 17, 2008, in connection with contemplated issuances of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered into interest rate protection agreements with counterparties to protect against increases in the
ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate. These treasury rates served as references in determining the interest rates applicable to the debt securities the Company issued in July 2003 and March 2008, respectively. As a result of changes in the
interest rates on those treasury securities between the time PCA entered into the agreements and the time PCA priced and issued the debt securities, the Company: (1) received a payment of $22.8 million from the counterparty upon settlement
of the 2003 interest rate protection agreement on July 21, 2003; and (2) made a payment of $4.4 million to the counterparty upon settlement of the 2008 interest rate protection agreement on March 25, 2008. The Company recorded
the settlements in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which are amortized over the terms of the respective notes. 
On May 25, 2010, in connection with a contemplated issuance of ten-year debt securities to eventually refinance PCAs currently
outstanding $400.0 million of senior notes that mature in 2013, PCA entered into interest rate protection agreements with counterparties to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate. The treasury rate will serve as
a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the new debt securities the Company expects to issue in the future. The interest rate protection agreements were properly documented and designated as cash flow hedges at inception. On
February 4, 2011, PCA settled the treasury locks and received a payment of $9.9 million. The settlement was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be amortized over the terms of the respective notes once issued.
 On August 1, 2011, PCA entered into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty to protect against
increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate. The treasury rate will serve as a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the new debt securities the Company expects to issue in the future to refinance PCAs currently
outstanding $400.0 million of senior notes that mature in 2013. At December 31, 2011, the Company had a notional value of $400.0 million in an interest rate protection agreement outstanding that is expected to settle by the end of 2012.
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  In connection with the energy optimization projects at its Valdosta, Georgia mill and Counce, Tennessee mill, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in 2009 and 2010 to hedge its
exposure to forecasted purchases of machinery and equipment denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward contracts were properly documented and designated as cash flow hedges at inception. At December 31, 2011, all contracts
have been settled for a loss of $0.7 million. The loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be amortized over the lives of the respective machinery and equipment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. At
December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.  Counterparty
Credit Risk  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these
derivative financial instruments. The amount of counterparty credit exposure is the unrealized gains, if any, on such derivative contracts. To minimize credit risk, the Company only enters into these types of transactions with investment grade
counterparties. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates each hedges net position relative to the counterpartys ability to cover its position. Although no assurances can be given, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties
to these derivative financial instruments to fail to meet its obligations.

The fair value of the term loan and the receivables credit facility approximates its
carrying amount due to the variable interest-rate feature of the instruments. The fair values of the senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the capital lease obligation was estimated to not be materially different from the
carrying amount.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
The following presents information about PCAs assets and liabilities measured at fair value and the valuation
techniques used to determine those fair values. The inputs used in the determination of fair values are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy as being Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in accordance with ASC 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures. The valuation techniques are as follows:  (a) Market
approach  prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities  (b) Cost approach  amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost) 
(c) Income approach  techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market
expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models)  Assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

 The money market funds PCA invests in include funds comprised of U.S. Treasury obligations or backed
by U.S. Treasury obligations. The Company measures the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  The Company calculates the fair value of its treasury locks and foreign currency forward contracts using quoted treasury rates and currency spot rates, respectively, plus or minus forward points to
calculate forward rates.  There were no changes in the Companys valuation techniques used to measure fair values on a
recurring basis as a result of adopting ASC 820. PCA had no assets or liabilities that were measured on a nonrecurring basis.

 The Company purchased $28.5 million, $32.8 million, and $37.3 million during the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, under these purchase agreements.  Litigation
 During September and October 2010, PCA and eight other U.S. and Canadian containerboard producers were named as
defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging violations of the Sherman Act. The lawsuits have been consolidated in a single complaint under the caption
Kleen Products LLC v Packaging Corp. of America et al. The consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to limit the supply of containerboard, and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially
increase prices of containerboard products during the period of August 2005 to the time of filing of the complaints. The complaint was filed as a purported class action suit on behalf of all purchasers of containerboard products during such period.
The complaint seeks treble damages and costs, including attorneys fees. The defendants motions to dismiss the complaint were denied by the court in 
  F-30

April 2011. PCA believes the allegations are without merit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously. However, as the lawsuit is in the early stages of discovery, PCA is unable to predict the
ultimate outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses.  PCA is a party to various other legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Environmental Liabilities  The potential costs for various
environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and
effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. From 1994 through 2011, remediation costs at the Companys mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2011, the Company maintained an
environmental reserve of $10.5 million relating to on-site landfills (see Note 14) and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of
the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, PCAs estimates may change. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures for remediation costs and asset retirement obligations above the $10.5 million accrued as of December 31, 2011, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Asset retirement obligations consist primarily of landfill capping and closure and post-closure costs. PCA is legally
required to perform capping and closure and post-closure care on the landfills at each of the Companys mills. In accordance with ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PCA recognizes the fair value of these
liabilities as an asset retirement obligation for each landfill and capitalizes that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated value of the asset retirement obligation over time, and the related
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Upon settlement of the liability, PCA will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the recorded liability. 
The following table describes changes to PCAs asset retirement obligation liability:

 Cash payments for income taxes were $52.7 million, $19.1 million and $22.3 million for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company had federal income
tax credit carryforwards included in deferred taxes of $167.5 million which can be used to offset federal taxes payable through December 31, 2015. The $167.5 million recognizes the full benefit of federal tax credit carryforwards as
claimed on PCAs federal tax return for the cellulosic biofuel credits before an adjustment of $102.0 million for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740. The deferred tax asset from the cellulosic biofuel producer credit carryforwards of
$167.5 million is described in more detail in Notes 16 and 20.  The following table summarizes the changes related

During the third quarter of 2011, the statue of limitations for the federal tax year of 2007
expired. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, various state statutes of limitations expired. As a result of these events, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by $2.0 million gross or $1.3 million net of the
federal benefit for state taxes during the third and fourth quarters of 2011. At December 31, 2011, PCA had recorded a $111.0 million reserve for uncertain tax positions excluding interest. Of the total, $106.8 million (net of the
federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The increase in reserve in 2010 is attributable to alternative energy tax credits as described in Note 16. 
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, PCA recorded $0.2 million gross ($0.16 million net) and
$0.2 million gross ($0.09 million net), respectively, in its statement of income, increasing the accrual for interest to $2.2 million gross ($1.4 million net) and $2.0 million gross ($1.2 million, net) at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. No accrual for penalties was made.  PCA and its subsidiaries are subject to
U.S. federal income taxes, as well as income taxes of multiple state and city jurisdictions. A federal examination of the tax years 2002 and 2004 has been concluded. The tax years 2008  2011 remain open to federal examination. The
tax years 2002  2011 remain open to state examinations. During March of 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) started an audit of PCAs 2008 and 2009 tax years, which includes the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in
the 2009 federal income tax return. Pending the timing and outcome of the IRS audit, which is not determinable at this time, PCA expects the reserve for uncertain tax positions to change significantly. PCA estimates the change in uncertain tax
positions to be between $0 and $104.7 million due to potential changes upon IRS examination.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TAX CREDITS 
The Company generated black liquor as a by-product of its pulp manufacturing process and used it in a mixture with
diesel fuel during 2009 to produce energy at its Counce, Tennessee, Valdosta, Georgia, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin mills. Through December 31, 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code provided a $0.50 per gallon refundable tax credit for taxpayers
who used alternative fuels in their trade or business. As a registered alternative fuel mixer, the Company believes the use of black liquor as an alternative fuel through December 31, 2009 qualified for this credit. After December 31,
2009, the alternative fuel mixture credit for a mixture of black liquor and diesel used is no longer available. During the first quarter of 2010, the IRS released a memorandum which provided clarification about the calculation of the alternative
fuel mixture credit for black liquor. As a result, during the first quarter of 2010 the Company released the reserve of $9.2 million that was established in 2009 due to the ambiguity in the calculation of the credit. This reserve release resulted in
additional income of $9.2 million, which was recorded in Alternative Fuel Mixture Tax Credits on the income statement in the first quarter of 2010.  The total alternative fuel mixture credits earned by PCA in 2008 and 2009 were $185.4 million, which was recorded as income with a corresponding receivable on its balance sheet during 2009 when the
Company received their registration as a producer of alternative fuels. As federal taxes became due, PCA applied these credits against the taxes due. The laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture tax credit are not completely
defined. The IRS has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability. PCA believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not subject the Company to federal or state income taxes on such benefits. If it is determined that any
of the credits are subject to taxation, PCA will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its income. 
In an IRS memorandum released during the second quarter of 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor also qualifies for the taxable
cellulosic biofuel producer credit of $1.01 per gallon of biofuel produced in 2009. In a subsequent memorandum, the IRS concluded that a black liquor producer may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit
in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor (the same gallon of fuel cannot receive both credits but can be claimed as either alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit). PCA received the required
cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in September 2010. 
  F-34



Table of Contents
Based upon both IRS memoranda and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit,
during the quarter ended September 30, 2010, the Company analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture credit, or claiming a combination of the
two credits for 2009. For the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009, PCA claimed about two-thirds of the gallons as cellulosic biofuel producer credits and about one-third of the gallons as alternative fuel mixture credits. As a result,
during the quarter ended September 30, 2010, the Company recorded a charge of $(111.9) million in Alternative Fuel Mixture Tax Credits due to the reversal of a portion of the income previously recorded from alternative fuel mixture credits and a
$145.8 million benefit in the (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes to reflect the reallocation of gallons to the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. The net impact of the reallocation of the gallons between the two credits resulted in additional net
income impact of $33.4 million in the third quarter of 2010. Additional expenses of $0.8 million ($0.5 million after tax) related to the cellulosic biofuel producer credit were also recorded. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company determined that its proprietary biofuel process at the Filer City, Michigan
mill would likely qualify for the 2009 cellulosic biofuel producer credit. The Company amended the 2009 federal return in December 2010 to claim these gallons, resulting in $107.0 million of cellulosic biofuel producer credits. Due to the unique and
proprietary nature of the Filer City mill process, IRS guidelines do not specifically address the process and uncertainty exists. As a result, the Company increased the reserve for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes, by
$102.0 million, which resulted in a fourth quarter net benefit of $5.0 million. Similar to the quarter ended September 30, 2010, the Company analyzed the appropriate combination of the cellulosic biofuel producer credit and the alternative fuel
mixture credit. As a result, the Company recorded income of $16.4 million in Alternative Fuel Mixture Tax Credits, representing gallons reallocated to the alternative fuel credits per the amended 2009 federal return. 
The cellulosic biofuel producer credit is a taxable credit. However, the laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture
credit are not completely defined. The IRS has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability. PCA believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not subject the Company to federal or state income taxes on such benefits. If
it is determined that any of the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to taxation, PCA will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its income. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company received notification
that the IRS will begin its review of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in the 2009 federal income tax return, and such review is under way.  The amount of credits that the Company can apply against future federal taxes owed will be dependent upon the timing and amount of PCAs future taxable income. As of December 31, 2011, including
the reserve for uncertain tax positions, PCA had as much as $167.5 million of tax credits to be used to offset future tax payments. The cellulosic biofuel producer credit carryforward must be utilized to offset federal taxes owed by
December 31, 2015, at which time the credit carryforward expires. A valuation allowance was not recorded against the deferred tax asset for this credit carryforward since the Company believes the credit can be fully utilized before expiration.
If it is determined that any of the credit carryforward will become subject to expiration, PCA will reduce the deferred tax asset and record a corresponding charge to income.  See Note 20 for a subsequent event which occurred on February 3, 2012, in which PCA amended its 2009 tax return to reflect a change in claimed gallons between the alternative fuel mixture credits and
cellulosic biofuel producer credits.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, PCA owned approximately 29% of Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV) and
had not guaranteed the debt of STV and has no future funding requirements. There is no carrying value of the Companys investment in STV under the equity method at December 31, 2011 and 2010. PCA did not receive any dividends from STV in
2011, 2010 or 2009.  PCA purchased pulpwood directly from STV for its Valdosta mill until November 2010, when STV sold its
timberlands to another entity. PCA purchased $2.7 million and $3.4 million of pulpwood for its Valdosta, Georgia mill from STV during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS 
On July 2, 2009, the Company acquired a specialty sheet business located in Chicago, Illinois for approximately $3.1
million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulting in $1.7 million of goodwill which is deductible for income tax purposes. Sales and total assets of the acquisition were not
material to the Companys overall sales and assets prior to the acquisition. Operating results of the plant subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Companys operating results. 
On April 14, 2011, the Company acquired Field Packaging Group, a corrugated products manufacturer located in Chicago, Illinois, for
$26.9 million. Sales and total assets of the acquisition were not material to the Companys overall sales and total assets prior to the acquisition. Operating results of the acquisition subsequent to April 14, 2011 are included in the
Companys operating results. The Company has allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of which $11.5 million has been allocated to goodwill (which is deductible for income tax purposes),
$9.5 million to customer lists (amortized over a life of ten years) and $0.2 million to other intangibles assets (amortized over a life of three years).  On September 10, 2011, the Company acquired Packaging Materials Company, a corrugated products manufacturer located near Huntsville, Alabama, for $8.6 million. Sales and total assets of the
acquisition were not material to the Companys overall sales and total assets prior to the acquisition. Operating results of the acquisition subsequent to September 10, 2011 are included in the Companys operating results. The Company
has allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of which, $1.5 million has been allocate to goodwill (which is deductible for income tax purposes). 
On November 30, 2011, PCA acquired Colorado Container, a corrugated products manufacturer located in Denver, Colorado, for $21.8
million. Sales and total assets of the acquisition were not material to PCAs overall sales and total assets prior to the acquisition. Operating results of the acquisition subsequent to November 30, 2011 are included in the Companys
operating results. The Company is currently allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

VALDOSTA MILL FIRE INSURANCE RECOVERY 
On April 4, 2011, the Companys Valdosta, Georgia mill had a fire that was confined to the turbine generator
room. The fire resulted in production and sales volume losses of 11,000 tons and significant repair and demolition expenses to affected buildings and equipment. PCA is insured for the lost production, replacement value of destroyed assets, and
related expenses, subject to a $3.0 million deductible. The Company filed an insurance claim for the total cost of the fire and received $6.5 million, net of the $3.0 million deductible, for losses incurred and capital expenditures
during the second quarter of 2011. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, the Company received an additional $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in insurance proceeds for capital expenditures. The $9.4 million in insurance
proceeds is included in net cash provided by operating activities ($5.5 million) and in net cash used for investing activities ($3.9 million) based on the nature of the reimbursement. PCA expects to receive additional insurance proceeds
for capital expenditures as work is completed.


 
 On February 3, 2012, PCA amended its 2009 tax return to reflect a change in claimed gallons between the alternative fuel mixture credits and the
cellulosic biofuel producer credits. This change is expected to result in a first quarter 2012 non-cash, after-tax charge of $23 million.

Note:
The sum of the quarters may not equal the total of the respective years earnings per share on either a basic   or diluted basis due to changes in the
weighted average shares outstanding throughout the year.  For the three months ended March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2011 net income was decreased by $2.1 million or $0.02 per share, $1.2 million or $0.01 per share, $1.0 million or $0.01 per share, and $0.5 million, or $0.005 per share,
respectively, due to asset disposal charges related to major energy projects.  For the three months ended June 30, 2011,
net income was increased by $1.0 million or $0.01 per share due to an adjustment to reserves related to medical benefits.  For
the three months ended September 30, 2010, income from operations was decreased by $111.9 million due to the reversal of a portion of income previously recorded from alternative fuel mixture tax credits in order to claim the cellulosic
biofuel producer credits that are recorded as a benefit in the provision for income taxes.  For the three months ended
March 31, September 30, and December 31, 2010, net income was increased by $9.2 million or $0.09 per share, $33.4 million or $0.33 per share, and $5.0 million or $0.05 per share, respectively, due to the alternative
energy tax credits.  For the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2010,
net income was decreased by $2.5 million or $0.02 per share, $1.1 million or $0.01 per share, $1.8 million or $0.02 per share, and $3.2 million or $0.03 per share, respectively, due to asset disposal and facilities closure
charges.
