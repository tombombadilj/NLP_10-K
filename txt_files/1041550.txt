PART I 
 


ITEM 1.
BUSINESS  In February
1998, HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) issued and sold 4,033,625 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the Common Stock), in connection with the conversion of Hopkinsville Federal Savings Bank (the
Bank) from a federal mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank and the issuance of the Banks capital stock to the Corporation. The conversion of the Bank, the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Bank by the Corporation and the issuance and sale of the Common Stock are collectively referred to herein as the Conversion. In June of 2010, the Corporation issued and sold 3,333,334 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share in
connection with a common stock offering. In July 2010, the Corporation issued and sold an additional 250,000 shares of common stock. Both sales were completed at an offering price of $9.00 per share. After underwriting fees and selling expenses, the
Corporation received additional capital proceeds of approximately $30.4 million. The consolidated results of the Bank and the Corporation are referred to as the Company.  HopFed Bancorp, Inc.  HopFed Bancorp, Inc. was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware in May 1997 at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank for the purpose of serving as a savings and loan holding company of the Bank upon the acquisition of all of the capital stock issued by the Bank in the
Conversion. The Corporations assets primarily consist of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank. The Corporations principal business is overseeing the business of the Bank. The Corporation has registered with the Federal Reserve Bank
(FRB) as a savings and loan holding company. See Regulation  Regulation of the Company.  As a
holding company, the Corporation has greater flexibility than the Bank to diversify its business activities through existing or newly formed subsidiaries or through acquisition or merger with other financial institutions, although the Company
currently does not have any plans, agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions or mergers. The Company is classified as a unitary savings and loan holding company. In previous years, both the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank, were supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the Office of Thrift Supervision was merged into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on July 21,
2011, which assumed responsibility for the supervision of Heritage Bank. After the merger of the Office of Thrift Supervision into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) assumed responsibility for the
supervision and regulation of the Company. The Companys executive offices are located at 4155 Lafayette Road, Hopkinsville, Kentucky 42240, and its main telephone number is (270) 885-1171. The Companys mailing address is P.O. Box
537, Hopkinsville, Kentucky 42241-0537.  Heritage Bank  The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, with branch offices in Kentucky and Tennessee. The Kentucky locations include Hopkinsville, Murray, Cadiz,
Elkton, Fulton, Calvert City and Benton. The Tennessee locations include Clarksville, Pleasant View, Ashland City, Kingston Springs and Erin. The Bank was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1879 under the name Hopkinsville Building and
Loan Association. In 1940, the Bank converted to a federal mutual savings association and received federal insurance of its deposit accounts. In 1983, the Bank became a federal mutual savings bank. On May 14, 2002, the Bank changed its name
from Hopkinsville Federal Bank to Heritage Bank. The primary market area of the Bank consists of the adjacent counties of Calloway, Christian, Todd, Trigg, Fulton, and Marshall located in southwestern Kentucky and Montgomery, Cheatham, Houston,
Obion & Weakley counties located in Tennessee.  The business of the Bank primarily consists of attracting deposits
from the general public and investing such deposits in loans secured by single family residential real estate and investment securities, including U.S. Government and agency securities, municipal and corporate bonds, collateralized mortgages
obligations (CMOs), and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank also originates single-family residential/construction loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans, as well as loans secured by deposits, other consumer loans and
commercial loans. The Bank emphasizes the origination of residential real estate loans with adjustable interest rates and other assets which are responsive to changes in interest rates and allow the Bank to more closely match the interest rate
maturation of its assets and liabilities.

Growth Opportunities  For the years ended December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Companys loan portfolio shrank by approximately $43.8 million and $42.1 million, respectively. There were many factors
that resulted in the Companys negative loan growth in 2011 and 2010. In 2010, the deployment of more than 15,000 troops from nearby Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to Afghanistan resulted in a reduced level of economic activity, lower sales for
merchants, weaker demand for most goods and services and reduced tax collections. Furthermore, the deployment of troops occurred during a time of a national recession, further exasperating the weakness in the local economy. The most recent
deployment of troops is ending and the majority of troops stationed at Fort Campbell have returned. Despite an increase in economic activity since the return of the division, loan demand remains muted. 
Another important factor inhibiting lending growth is the presence of a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement (MOU) originally
between the Board of Directors of the Company and the OTS. The MOU requires the Bank to limit the growth of specific types of lending, including commercial real estate lending. In 2010 and 2011, the MOUs limitation on commercial real estate
made it more difficult for the Bank to experience positive loan growth. The MOUs limitation on commercial real estate lending is focused on the OTS definition of commercial real estate loan concentrations. OTS viewed all commercial real estate
under the same risk profile while the OCC and FDIC may view owner occupied commercial real estate differently as compared to non-owner occupied commercial real estate.  As discussed previously, supervision of the Company and Heritage Bank is now the responsibility of the FRB and OCC, respectively. We anticipate that the change in the interpretation of regulations may
change possible making it easier for the Company to grow its loan portfolio in the future. The Company anticipates undergoing its first OCC examination in June of 2012, after which time we will have a clearer picture of how these regulations will be
interpreted in the future.  The Companys rural markets have fared relatively well compared to urban markets and high
growth coastal areas. In 2011, the yields on corn, soybean, and wheat were below average as spring-time flooding was followed by a summer drought. Higher commodity prices helped offset below average yields. The agricultural community has good reason
to be optimistic in 2012 as commodity prices are at near record levels. The Company anticipates an increase in crop production and an increase in demand for agricultural related credit. 
Despite the limited short term growth prospects, the Companys longer term prospects remain strong. The Fort Campbell Army Base
continues to experience growth as the Army consolidates smaller bases into this facility. The continued construction of the Hemlock Semiconductor plant (production scheduled to begin in 2012) will provide a stable demand for construction labor as
well as opportunity for highly desirable employment when production begins. The Companys Cheatham County market provides an excellent inroad into the Nashville, Tennessee MSA. The Company anticipates that this market will be among the first to
experience an economic recovery due to its well diversified economy and ideal location. Furthermore, the Companys growth opportunities will continue to be enhanced as many of its competitors struggle to remain in business due to credit and
capital concerns. Typically, these opportunities are in the form of seizing on both customer and bank employees dissatisfied with the poor quality of service and the limitations placed on their employees and availability of credit at larger regional
and national banks. The Company also anticipates that a limited number of whole bank and branch acquisition opportunities will be available within its market. The Company is interested in FDIC assisted transactions but has a strong preference for
local acquisitions.  The Company continues to focus its marketing campaign on increasing its market share of checking
accounts. The campaign continues to be a resounding success, opening more than 3,500 new non-interest bearing checking accounts opened in each of the last three years. The Company will continue to focus significant resources to this campaign.

On December 12, 2008, the Company received an $18.4 million investment from the United
States Treasury in the form of preferred stock. The terms of the investment included a 5% dividend for five years, increasing to 9% thereafter. The investment has no stated maturity but may be paid back in whole or part at any time with regulatory
approval. In addition to the dividend, the Treasury received 243,816 stock warrants that are immediately exercisable with a ten year maturity and a strike price of $11.32. The amount and price of the warrants have been adjusted to 253,665.84 shares
and a strike price of $10.88 as a result of a 2% stock dividend declared for shareholders of record at September 30, 2010 and October 3, 2011.  In June and July of 2010, the Company sold a total of 3,583,334 shares of Common Stock at $9.00 per share in a public offering. The net proceeds of the public offering, $30.4 million, were used for
general corporate purposes and included a $10 million distribution to the Bank, our wholly owned subsidiary. The sale of common stock in June 2010 included 112,639 shares of treasury stock. 
At this time, the Company has not redeemed the $18.4 million in preferred stock issued to the United States Treasury under the Troubled
Asset Relief Program. The Company continues to evaluate local and national economic trends and the Companys trends of criticized and non-performing assets. It remains the Companys intent to repurchase the preferred stock prior to the
increase of the dividend to 9% in December of 2013. At this time, the Company does not anticipate raising additional capital to repurchase the preferred stock but may raise additional capital should the opportunity for an acquisition present itself.

 Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The
average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give the lender the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other
things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing
mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans.

 As discussed on page 3 of this report, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to an MOU issued by the
OTS and currently enforced by the OCC and FRB. A significant concern to the OTS was the level of the Banks non-residential real estate lending as compared to its risk based capital. The OTS considered all lending outside of loans secured by
commercial equipment, consumer goods, and 1-4 family homes as non-residential real estate. At December 31, 2011, non-residential real estate loans total 183.5 million, or approximately 143.25% of total consolidated risk based capital. The
Company uses standardized industry codes known as NASICS codes to track the individual components of its loan portfolio, including our non-residential real estate loan portfolio. At December 31, 2011, the Company commercial real estate loan

In addition to the measurements prescribed by the OTS in its MOU, management measures
commercial real estate (CRE) concentrations as discussed in Concentrations of Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices issued on December 12, 2006, jointly by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In this guidance, the agencies make a significant distinction between owner-occupied CRE and non-owner occupied CRE. The
agencies have a heighted level of concerned with those loans with risk profiles sensitive to the condition of the CRE market. CRE loans secured by non-farm, non-residential CRE where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing
operations and activities conducted by the owner of the property are generally excluded from the guidance. Using the instructions provided in the FDIC call report, the Company estimates that 60% of our CRE portfolio (excluding land) consists of
owner occupied properties. Management anticipates that this guidance will be applied to its operations during the first OCC examination scheduled to begin in June of 2012.  Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans. The Bank generally has authority to originate and purchase loans secured by real estate located throughout the United States. Consistent with its
emphasis on being a community-oriented financial institution, the Bank conducts substantially all of its lending activities in its market area. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to loan origination activity for the
periods indicated.

 Loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including existing customers, referrals by real
estate agents, depositors and borrowers and advertising, as well as walk-in customers. Solicitation programs consist of advertisements in local media, in addition to occasional participation in various community organizations and events. Real estate
loans are originated by the Banks loan personnel. All of the loan personnel are salaried, and are not compensated on a commission basis for loans originated. Loan applications are accepted at any of the Banks branches. 
Loan Underwriting Policies. Lending activities are subject to written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and to loan
origination procedures prescribed by the Board of Directors and its management. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the ability of borrowers to repay, and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use
of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations. Loan requests exceeding loan officer limits must be approved by the loan committee or Board of Directors. 
  8 


Generally, upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report
and verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicants employment, income and credit standing. If a proposed loan is to be secured by a mortgage on real estate, an appraisal of the real estate is
undertaken by an appraiser approved by the Board of Directors and licensed or certified (as necessary) by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the State of Tennessee. In the case of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, except when the Bank
becomes aware of a particular risk of environmental contamination, the Bank generally does not obtain a formal environmental report on the real estate at the time a loan is made. A formal environmental report may be required in connection with
nonresidential real estate loans.  It is the Banks policy to record a lien on the real estate securing a loan and to
obtain a title opinion from Kentucky counsel who provides that the property is free of prior encumbrances and other possible title defects. Title Insurance is generally required on all commercial real estate loans, all one-to-four family loans with
balances exceeding $70,000 and all one-to-four family loans that are to be sold in the secondary market. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and, when the property is in a flood hazard area, pay flood insurance
policy premiums. The majority of real estate loan applications are underwritten and closed in accordance with the Banks own lending guidelines, which generally do not conform to secondary market guidelines. Although such loans may not be
readily saleable in the secondary market, management believes that, if necessary, such loans may be sold to private investors at a discount to par.  The Bank offers a fixed rate loan program with maturities of 15, 20, and 30 years. These loans are underwritten and closed in accordance with secondary market standards. These loans are originated with
the intent to sell on the secondary market. The Bank offers both servicing retained and servicing released products in an attempt to meet the needs of our customers. At December 31, 2011, the Banks 1-4 family loan servicing portfolio was
approximately $22.3 million.  The Bank is permitted to lend up to 100% of the appraised value of the residential real property
securing a mortgage loan. Under its lending policies, the Bank will originate a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan for owner-occupied property with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 95%. For residential properties that are not owner-occupied,
the Bank generally does not lend more than 80% of the appraised value. For all residential mortgage loans, the Bank may increase its lending level on a case-by-case basis, provided that the excess amount is insured with private mortgage insurance.
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the loan committee or the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2011, the Bank held approximately $10.6 million of 1-4 family residential mortgages with a loan to value ratio exceeding 90% without
private mortgage insurance. For these loans at December 31, 2011, approximately $111,000 was past due more than 30 days or in non-accrual status.  Under applicable law, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit outstanding by a savings institution to a person at one time shall not exceed 15% of the institutions unimpaired
capital and surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral may comprise an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus. Applicable law additionally authorizes savings institutions to make loans to one
borrower, for any purpose, in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $30.0 million or 30% of unimpaired capital and surplus to develop residential housing, provided certain requirements are satisfied. Under these limits, the Banks loans to one
borrower were limited to approximately $16.6 million at December 31, 2011. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. 
Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected principally by competitive factors, the demand for such loans and the supply of
funds available for lending purposes. These factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and government budgetary matters.

  9 


One-to-four Family Residential Lending. The Bank historically has been and continues
to be an originator of one-to-four family residential real estate loans in its market area. At December 31, 2011, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled approximately $216.1 million, or 38.1% of the Banks loan portfolio.
The Bank originated approximately $36.4 million in loans that were sold in the secondary market with servicing released. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had approximately $2.3 million in one-to-four family residential real estate loans past due
more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2011, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $3.3 million in reserve for one to four family residential lending. 
The Bank primarily originates residential mortgage loans with adjustable rates. As of December 31, 2011, 86.4% of one-to-four family
mortgage loans in the Banks loan portfolio carried adjustable rates or mature within one year. The Banks one to four family loan portfolio consists of closed end first and second mortgages as well as opened ended home equity lines of
credit. At December 31, 2011, approximately $177.4 million of the Banks residential mortgage portfolio consisted of closed end first and second mortgage loans. Such loans are primarily for terms of 25 years, although the Bank does
occasionally originate adjustable rate mortgages for 15, 20 and 30 year terms, in each case amortized on a monthly basis with principal and interest due each month. The interest rates on these mortgages are adjusted once per year, with a maximum
adjustment of 1% per adjustment period and a maximum aggregate adjustment of 5% over the life of the loan. Prior to August 1, 1997, rate adjustments on the Banks adjustable rate loans were indexed to a rate which adjusted annually
based upon changes in an index based on the National Monthly Median Cost of Funds, plus a margin of 2.75%. Because the National Monthly Median Cost of Funds is a lagging index, which results in rates changing at a slower pace than rates generally in
the marketplace, the Bank changed to a one-year Treasury bill constant maturity (One Year CMT), which the Bank believes reflects more current market information and thus allows the Bank to react more quickly to changes in the interest
rate environment. In mid 2004, the Bank increased its margin on its adjustable rate loans to 3.00%. However, the vast majority of the current adjustable rate portfolio maintains a margin of 2.75% over the One Year CMT. 
The Bank also originates, to a limited extent, fixed-rate loans for terms of 10 and 15 years. Such loans are secured by first mortgages
on one-to-four family, owner-occupied residential real property located in the Banks market area. Because of the Banks policy to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of adjustable rate rather than fixed rate
products, the Bank does not emphasize fixed-rate mortgage loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans originated by the Bank are loans that often do not qualify for the secondary market due to numerous factors not related to credit quality. Typically, these
products are not priced to be competitive with secondary market loans but to offer as an alternative if that option is not available. At December 31, 2011, $29.3 million of the Banks loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate one-to-four
family first mortgage loans that will mature after December 31, 2012. To further reduce its interest rate risk associated with such loans, the Bank may rely upon FHLB advances with similar maturities to fund such loans. See  Deposit
Activity and Other Sources of Funds  Borrowing.  At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $38.7 million in home
equity lines of credit outstanding and $30.5 million of additional credit available. Typically, these loans are for a term of fifteen years and have loan to value ratio of 80% to 100%. The home equity portfolio is priced at a spread to prime,
adjusted daily, depending on the customers loan to value ratio at the time of origination. Many of the home equity lines of credit require monthly interest payments with all unpaid interest and principal due at maturity. 
The retention of adjustable rate loans in the Banks portfolio helps reduce, but does not eliminate, the Banks exposure to
increases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward re-pricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of
rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Further, although adjustable rate loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to
changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the initial fixed-rate period before the first adjustment and the lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. This risk is heightened by the Banks prior
practice of offering its adjustable rate mortgages with a 1% limitation on annual interest rate adjustments. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the Banks adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in
the Banks cost of funds. 
  10 


Finally, adjustable rate loans increase the Banks exposure to decreases in prevailing
market interest rates, although the 1% limitation on annual decreases in the loans interest rate tends to offset this effect. In times of declining interest rates, borrowers often refinance into fixed rate loan products, limiting the
Banks ability to significantly increase its interest rate margin on adjustable rate loans in a declining interest rate market. In times of increasing interest rates, the 1% annual cap on increases in the interest rates tends to reduce
refinancing activity and reduce the Banks net interest margin.  Neither the fixed rate nor the adjustable rate
residential mortgage loans held in the Banks portfolio are originated in conformity with secondary market guidelines issued by FHLMC or FNMA. As a result, such loans may not be readily saleable in the secondary market to institutional
purchasers. However, such loans may still be sold to private investors whose investment strategies do not depend upon loans that satisfy FHLMC or FNMA criteria. Further, given its high liquidity, the Bank does not currently view loan sales as a
necessary funding source.  Construction Lending. The Bank engages in construction lending involving loans to
individuals for construction of one-to-four family residential housing, multi-family housing and non-residential real estate located within the Banks market area, with such loans converting to permanent financing upon completion of
construction. The Bank mitigates its risk with construction loans by imposing a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for homes that will be owner-occupied or being built on a speculative basis. 
The Bank also makes loans to qualified builders for the construction of one-to-four family residential housing located in established
subdivisions in the Banks market area. Because such homes are intended for resale, such loans are generally not converted to permanent financing at the Bank. All construction loans are secured by a first lien on the property under
construction.  Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant.
Construction/permanent loans may have adjustable or fixed interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same terms and requirements as the Banks permanent mortgages. 
Such loans generally provide for disbursement in stages during a construction period of up to eighteen months, during which period the
borrower is required to make payments of interest only. The permanent loans are typically 30-year adjustable rate loans, with the same terms and conditions otherwise offered by the Bank. Monthly payments of principal and interest commence the month
following the date the loan is converted to permanent financing. Borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that would apply to the Banks permanent mortgage loan financing prior to receiving construction financing for the subject property.
 Construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on
improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest)
of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a
project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. The ability of a developer to sell developed lots or completed dwelling units will depend on, among other things, demand, pricing, availability of comparable properties and
economic conditions. The Bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in the Banks market area, by requiring the involvement of qualified builders, and by limiting the aggregate amount of
outstanding construction loans. At December 31, 2008, the Banks loan portfolio included $62.3 million. By that time, the Bank had begun to reduce its construction loan exposure due to concerns about a slowing economy. The significant
reduction in construction loans has had a negative impact on the Banks loan portfolio balances and net interest margin. However, the negative impact has been offset by the relatively minor credit problems that have occurred in this portfolio.

  11 


At December 31, 2011, the Banks loan portfolio included $11.9 million of loans
secured by properties under construction, including construction/permanent loans structured to become permanent loans upon the completion of construction and interim construction loans structured to be repaid in full upon completion of construction
and receipt of permanent financing. At December 31, 2011, approximately $7.9 million of construction loans were for one to four family dwellings, $1.4 million were for multi-family dwellings and $2.6 million were for non-residential real
estate. At December 31, 2011, there were no construction loans past due more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2011, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $139,000 in reserve for construction loans.
 Multi-Family Residential and Non-Residential Real Estate Lending. The Banks multi-family residential loan
portfolio consists of fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by real estate. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $33.7 million of multi-family residential loans, which amounted to 5.9% of the Banks loan portfolio at such date. The
Banks non-residential real estate portfolio generally consists of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate, residential lots, and rental property. In most cases, such property is located in the
Banks market area. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had approximately $235.8 million of such loans, which comprised 41.5% of its loan portfolio. The Company estimates that approximately 60% of its non-residential real estate loans
(excluding land loans) are owner occupied. Multi-family residential real estate loans are underwritten with loan-to-value ratios up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Non-residential real estate loans are underwritten with loan-to-value
ratios up to 65% of the appraised value for raw land and 75% for land development loans.  Multi-family residential and
non-residential real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with one-to-four family residential property lending. Multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single
borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, retail establishment or business. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and
demand conditions in the market for the office, retail and residential space, and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy generally.  To minimize these risks, the Bank generally limits itself to its market area or to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise known to the Bank. It has been the Banks policy
to obtain annual financial statements of the business of the borrower or the project for which multi-family residential real estate or non-residential real estate loans are made. At December 31, 2011, no multi-family loans were past due more
than 90 days or classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2011, there were $3.6 million in non-residential real estate and loan loans that were past due by 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual. 
In 2010 and 2011, weather related events both locally and nationally factored into the performance of the non-residential real estate
portfolio. Locally, significant flooding in both years resulted in farmers having to delay or replant spring crops and limited overall yields on wheat crops. Yields were especially weak in 2011, with unusually high commodity prices partially
offsetting lower yields. In 2011, local manufactures were affected by a tornado in the Christian County industrial park and the tsunami in Japan, which resulted in lower demand for auto parts from Asian automakers. 
In 2010, the Company experienced a significant increase in the amount of delinquency and charge offs in the multi-family portfolio. In
2010, the Company charged off approximately $1.5 million (net of recoveries) in multi-family properties while transferring another $7.9 million to other real estate owned. The increase in delinquency, other real estate owned and loan losses for
multi-family loans is the result of a small number of customer relationships that have been affected by the deployment of military personnel. In 2011, credit quality improved as we were successful in liquidating a large portion of the Companys
other real estate owned. In 2011, the Companys most significant credit quality issues were concentrated in our commercial real estate portfolio. In 2011, the Companys commercial real estate portfolio experienced approximately $2.5
million in net charge offs. At December 31, 2011, the Company has provided reserves in the allowance for loan loss account related to its commercial real estate loan portfolio (including land) and multi-family portfolio of $5.0 million and $1.2
million, respectively.

Consumer Lending. The consumer loans currently in the Banks loan portfolio
consist of loans secured by savings deposits and other consumer loans. Savings deposit loans are usually made for up to 90% of the depositors savings account balance. The interest rate is approximately 2.0% above the rate paid on such deposit
account serving as collateral, and the account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan. Interest generally is billed on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2011, loans on deposit accounts totaled $4.0 million, or 0.7% of the Banks
loan portfolio. Other consumer loans include automobile loans, the amount and terms of which are determined by the loan committee, and home equity and home improvement loans, which are made for up to 100% of the value of the property. At
December 31, 2011, other consumer loan accounts totaled $11.1 million, or 2.0% of total loans.  Consumer loans may entail
greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted
consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers
continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can
be recovered on such loans. At December 31, 2011, there was $9,000 in consumer loans delinquent 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2011, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $262,000 in reserve for
consumer loans.  Commercial Lending. The Bank originates commercial loans on a secured and, to a lesser extent,
unsecured basis. At December 31, 2011, the Banks commercial loans amounted to $54.7 million, or 9.7% of the Banks loan portfolio. The Banks commercial loans generally are secured by business assets. In addition, the Bank
generally obtains guarantees from the principals of the borrower with respect to all commercial loans. At December 31, 2011, there was $254,000 in commercial loans delinquent 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual. At December 31,
2011, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $1.3 million in reserve for commercial loans. 
  13 


Non-accrual Loans and Other Problem Assets 
The Banks non-accrual loans totaled 1.08% of total loans at December 31, 2011. Loans are placed on a non-accrual status when
the loan is past due in excess of 90 days or the collection of principal and interest is doubtful. The Bank places a high priority on contacting customers by telephone as a primary method of determining the status of delinquent loans and the action
necessary to resolve any payment problem. The Banks management performs quality reviews of problem assets to determine the necessity of establishing additional loss reserves. The Banks total non-performing assets to total asset ratio was
0.81% at December 31, 2011.  The following table sets forth information with respect to the Banks non-accrual loans
at the dates indicated.

 Federal regulations require savings institutions to classify their assets on the basis of quality on a
regular basis. In determining the classification of an asset, the Company utilizes a Classified Asset Committee consisting of members of senior management, accounting, credit analysis, loan administration, loan review, internal audit and
collections. The committee is charged with determining the value of assets that are potentially impaired as well as the accurate reporting of Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) assets as defined later in this report. The committees function is
an important step in managements determination as to the necessary level of funding required in the Companys allowance for loan loss account.  An asset meeting one of the classification definitions set forth below may be classified and still be a performing loan. An asset is classified as substandard if it is determined to be inadequately
protected by the current retained earnings and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. A substandard classification may also result from the change in business purpose of a loan and / or its collateral. For example, a
home builder who intends to sell a home upon completion changes his mind due to market conditions and places the home in a rental portfolio that he maintains.  The Company may allow the builder to do this if he has experience in this line of business but requires the customer to refinance the home on a twenty year loans with monthly principal and interest
payments. The change of business purpose (built for sale then converted to rental) requires that the Company classify the loan as substandard and review the collateral for impairment. After a period of time of satisfactory loan performance and
having satisfactory financial trends, the Company may gradually upgrade the loan from substandard to satisfactory. The typical time for a loan to receive an upgrade from a substandard to satisfactory is twelve to eighteen months of continuous
satisfactory performance. 
  14 


An asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable.
An asset is classified as loss if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future. The regulations also provide for a special mention designation, described as assets which do not currently expose a savings
institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving managements close attention. Such assets designated as special mention may include non-performing loans
consistent with the above definition.  Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require a savings institution to conduct
an impairment test to determine if the establishment of a specific reserve against the allowance for loan loss account is necessary. Typically, the basis for a loan impairment test is the current market value of the collateral, discounted to allow
for selling and carrying cost. Typically, new appraisals on 1-4 family properties are discounted 10% to 15% from the appraised value while land and commercial real estate are discounted at 15% to 25% of new appraised values depending on the
perceived marketability of the property.  The Company requires a new appraisal for all impairment testing of collateral when
the loan balance exceeds $100,000. For loans less than $100,000, the Company may choose to use an old appraisal and provide additional discounts to the appraised value in determining the amount of specific reserve required. In the last twelve
months, the Company has found that appraisers face in increase in request for services and the time between a request for an appraisal and its completion is longer than normal, up to sixty days for complex multi-family or commercial properties.
During the interim, the Company may chose to use an old appraisal with larger discounts to ascertain the likelihood of a loan impairment until a current appraisal is received.  If an asset or portion thereof is classified loss, a savings institution must either establish a specific allowance for loss in the amount of the portion of the asset-classified loss, or charge off such
amount. If the Company determines that a loan relationship is collateral dependent, it will charge off the portion of that loan that is deemed to be impaired. The Company defines collateral dependent as any loan in that the customer will be unable
to reduce the principal balance of the loan without the complete or partial sale of the collateral. As a result of applying these principals to the classified loan portfolio, the Company charged off more than $2.0 million in impaired loans in the
fourth quarter of 2011.  Federal examiners may disagree with a savings institutions classifications. If a savings
institution does not agree with an examiners classification of an asset, it may appeal this determination to the OTS Regional Director. The Bank regularly reviews its assets to determine whether any assets require classification or
re-classification. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $47.5 million in assets classified as substandard and $1.7 million in assets classified as doubtful. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful by the Bank meet our classification of
impaired loans, as defined by FASB ASC 942-310-45-1.  As depicted in the table below, the level of impaired assets experienced
a moderate decline in 2011 as compared to 2010. The decline was primary the result of modest improvement in the local and national economy and the return of deployed army personnel assigned to Fort Campbell from the Middle East. The decline in
classified assets does not necessarily translate into a lower level of charge offs.

 Troubled Debt Restructuring  Due to challenges in the local and national economy that persisted into 2010, the Company has had more of its customers incur financial problems. These customers may request temporary or permanent
modification of loans in an effort to avoid foreclosure. The Company analyzes each request separately and grants loan modifications based on the customers ability to eventually repay the loan and return to the original loan terms, the
customers current loan status and the current and projected future value of the Banks collateral. Loans that are modified as a result of a customers financial distress are classified as Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR). The
classification of a loan as TDR is important in that it indicates that a particular customer may not be past due but represents a credit weakness due to the Banks willingness to modify loan terms based on the financial weakness of the
borrower. 
  16 


The classification of a loan as a TDR may represent the Companys last best
chance to work with a distressed customer before foreclosure proceedings begin. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $7.8 million in loans classified as TDR, with $6.2 million of reported TDRs performing as agreed by the loans
modified terms. At December 31, 2011, non-performing TDRs included $1.4 million in 1-4 family mortgage loans, $100,000 in loans on junior liens on residential mortgages and $105,000 in commercial loans. At December 31, 2011, the Company
had $1.0 million in specific reserves of the allowance for loan loss account allocated to loans classified as performing TDRs and $175,000 in specific reserves for non-performing TDRs. A summary of loans classified as TDR and the respective TDR
activity for the year ended December 31, 2011, can be found in the table below (Dollars in Thousands):

 Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such
time as it is sold. The Bank generally tries to sell the property at its current market price. The current market price is determined by obtaining an appraisal prior to the acquisition of the property. When such property is acquired, it is recorded
at its fair value less estimated costs of sale. In the last eighteen months, the Company has determined that properties acquired through foreclosure have experienced a significant loss in market value as compared to the market value at the time of
the origination of the loan. At the time of foreclosure, the collateral is reduced in value to its fair market value less holding and selling expenses and the remaining balance is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to
foreclosure, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a valuation allowance is established if the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value net of related selling expenses. The value of
other real estate owned is periodically evaluated, no less than annually, to ascertain its current market value. Additional reductions in market value or recognized as an expense through a charge to losses on real estate owned. At December 31,
2011, the Banks real estate and other assets owned totaled $2.3 million.  The following table sets forth information
with respect to the Banks real estate and other assets owned at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010 (Dollars in Thousands):

Allowance for Loan Losses. In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that credit
losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the
quality of the security for the loan. It is managements policy to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, the Banks and the industrys historical loan loss experience, evaluation of economic
conditions, regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality and evolving standards imposed by federal bank examiners and other regulatory agencies. The Bank increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses
against the Banks income.  Management will continue to actively monitor the Banks asset quality and allowance for
loan losses. Management will charge off loans and properties acquired in settlement of loans against the allowances for loan losses on such loans and such properties when appropriate and will provide specific loss allowances when necessary. Although
management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for loan losses and believes such allowances are adequate, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ
substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.  The Banks
methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific assets as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur. Management
conducts regular reviews of the Banks assets and evaluates the need to establish allowances on the basis of this review. Allowances are established by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the
Banks assets taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency trends, current charge-off and loss experience, loan concentrations, the state of the real estate market, regulatory reviews conducted in the
regulatory examination process and economic conditions generally.  Specific reserves will be provided for individual assets,
or portions of assets, when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the assets and the fair value of the security. At the date of foreclosure or other repossession, the Bank would transfer
the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans initially at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and subsequently at the lower of book value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Any portion of the outstanding loan balance in
excess of fair value less estimated selling costs would be charged off against the allowance for loan losses. If, upon ultimate disposition of the property, net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property, a gain on sale of other
real estate would be recorded.  Financial institutions must provide adequate disclosure of the methodology used regarding
maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses and an effective loan review system. The Bank utilizes a combination of its four quarter loan loss history and the sum of all impairment testing completed on individually classified
loans.  The charge off history is weighted using the sum of the years digits. This method provides
the a 40% weight to the most recent quarters losses, then 30% for the prior quarters losses, 20% for the 2nd prior quarters losses and 10% for the fourth quarter losses. Using this method, the Bank trends for increasing or decreasing levels of charge offs may materially impact the funding level of the allowance
for loan loss account. Additional, the Bank reserves the loss amount of any loans deemed to be impaired. The Bank also applies certain qualitative factors in reviewing its allowance funding, including local and national delinquency and loss trends,
noted concentrations or risk and recent additions to regulator guidance.  Financial institutions regulated by the OCC and FDIC
may require institutions to immediately charge off any portion of a collateral dependent loan that is deemed to be impaired. After July 21, 2011, the Company anticipates that this requirement will be applied to it as well, eliminating all
specific reserves for impaired loans.

Investment Activities  The Company makes investments in order to maintain the levels of liquid assets required by regulatory authorities and manage cash flow, diversify its assets, obtain yield and to satisfy certain
requirements for favorable tax treatment. The principal objective of the investment policy is to earn as high a rate of return as possible, but to consider also financial or credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The investment
activities of the Corporation and the Bank consist primarily of investments in U.S. Government agency securities, municipal and corporate bonds, CMOs (see definition below), and mortgage-backed securities. Typical investments include federally
sponsored agency mortgage pass-through and federally sponsored agency and mortgage-related securities. Investment and aggregate investment limitations and credit quality parameters of each class of investment are prescribed in the Banks
investment policy. The Corporation and the Bank perform analyses on mortgage-related securities prior to purchase and on an ongoing basis to determine the impact on earnings and market value under various interest rate and prepayment conditions.
Securities purchases must be approved by the Banks Chief Financial Officer or President. The Board of Directors reviews all securities transactions on a monthly basis.  At December 31, 2011, securities, including FHLB stock, with an amortized cost of $359.6 million and an approximate market value of $362.1 million were classified as available for sale. Management
presently does not intend to sell such securities and, based on the current liquidity level and the access to borrowings through the FHLB of Cincinnati, management currently does not anticipate that the Corporation or the Bank will be placed in a
position of having to sell securities with material unrealized losses.  Mortgage-Backed and Related Securities.
Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of one-to-four family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which are passed from the mortgage originators through intermediaries that pool and
repackage the participation interest in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. CMOs are a variation of mortgage-backed securities in which the mortgage pool is divided into specific classes, with different classes receiving
different principal reduction streams based on numerous factors, including prepayments speeds. Such intermediaries may include quasi-governmental agencies such as FHLMC, FNMA and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) which
guarantees the payment of principal and interest to investors. Of the $108.7 million mortgage-backed security portfolio and $20.5 million CMO portfolio at December 31, 2011, approximately $39.4 million were originated through GNMA,
approximately $67.9 million were originated through FNMA, approximately $20.1 million were originated through FHLMC, and approximately $1.8 million are Whole Loan CMOs.  Typically, the collateral in Whole Loan CMOs include jumbo mortgages that exceeded the limits provided by federal agencies and do not have a federal government or agency guarantee. The issuers of
Whole Loan CMOs receive an AAA rating by credit rating agencies by providing an overabundance of collateral to secure these investments. In capital computations, Whole Loan CMOs are risk rated 20%, the same of FNMA and FHLMC. At
December 31, 2011, the Company owns two securities, with a combined market value of $1.2 million that have been downgraded below investment grade. During 2011, the Company incurred a $155,000 in Other Than Temporary Impairment charge to
recognize potential losses on these securities due to higher than anticipated defaults within their portfolios. Whole Loan CMOs that fail to maintain an AAA rating from S&P or Moodys are risked weighted 100%. See Note 2 of Notes to
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Mortgage-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and the
securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have similar maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage loans.
Mortgage-backed securities generally are referred to as mortgage participation certificates or pass-through certificates. As a result, the interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, i.e., fixed-rate or adjustable-rate,
as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life of the underlying mortgages. The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when
the mortgagors prepay or repay the underlying mortgages. Prepayments of the underlying mortgages may shorten the life of the investment, thereby adversely affecting its yield to maturity and the related market value of the mortgage-backed security.
 Amortizing U.S. Agency securities owned by the Company are similar in structure to mortgage backed securities. The Company
owns two types of amortizing agency securities, both of which are issued with the full faith and credit guarantee of the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Small Business Investment Corporation (SBIC) bonds include pools of SBA loans for
business equipment with a ten year maturity. The Small Business Administration Participation Notes (SBAP) has a twenty year maturity and are secured by pools of commercial real estate loans guaranteed by the SBA. Both investments provide superior
yields to mortgage backed securities with a credit rating equal to GNMA and superior to FHLMC and FNMA. The actual cash flows and prepayment speeds for SBIC and SBAP bonds are typically slower than similar maturities for mortgage backed securities
due to the cost of refinancing SBA loans.  The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of the premium or
accretion of the discount related to the mortgage-backed security. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted over the estimated term of the securities using a level yield method. The prepayment assumptions used
to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage-backed security, and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect the actual prepayment. The actual prepayments of the
underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgage, the coupon rate, the age of the mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest
rates. The difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates is an important determinant in the rate of prepayments. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally
increase, and, conversely, during periods of rising mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally decrease. If the coupon rate of the underlying mortgage significantly exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans,
refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages. Prepayment experience is more difficult to estimate for adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities.

 The following table sets forth information on the scheduled maturities, amortized cost, market values and
average yields for U.S. Government agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal securities in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2011. At such date, $24.2 million of the agency securities were callable and/or due on or before
December 31, 2012 and $4.1 million were due and/or callable before December 31, 2013. The Bank had securities that may be called only one time totaling $12.7 million that are callable in the year ending December 31, 2012, and $4.1
million that are callable only once on February 26, 2013. In addition, approximately $130.4 million in small business administration amortizing bonds require periodic principal payments. At December 31, 2011, all municipal securities (both
taxable and tax free) were callable and/or due between January 2012 and December 2020. The average yield for the tax free municipal security portfolio is quoted as a taxable equivalent yield.

Deposit Activity and Other Sources of Funds 
General. Deposits are the primary source of the Banks funds for lending, investment activities and general operational
purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan principal and interest repayments, maturities of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities and interest payments thereon. Although loan repayments are a relatively stable
source of funds, deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds, or on a longer
term basis for general corporate purposes. The Bank has access to borrow from the FHLB of Cincinnati, and the Bank will continue to have access to FHLB of Cincinnati advances. The Bank may rely upon retail deposits rather than borrowings as its
primary source of funding for future asset growth.  Deposits. The Bank attracts deposits principally from within its
market area by offering competitive rates on its deposit instruments, including money market accounts, passbook savings accounts, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit which range in maturity from three months to five years.
Deposit terms vary according to the minimum balance required and the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Maturities, terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties for its deposit accounts are established by the Bank
on a periodic basis. The Bank reviews its deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. In determining the characteristics of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers the rates offered by competing institutions, lending and liquidity requirements,
growth goals and federal regulations.  The Bank has, on a limited basis, utilized brokered deposits to augment its funding
requirements. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $56.3 million in brokered deposits as compared to $75.7 million at December 31, 2010. In addition to brokered deposits, the Bank has deposits through the CDARS program of $2.1 million at
December 31, 2011, as compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2010, that are classified as brokered deposits by our regulators. The Bank often chooses these to use longer termed brokered deposits as a substitute for local deposits which
can be expensive in the Banks local market. The MOU currently between the Bank and the OCC limits the amount of outstanding brokered deposits to $104.0 million, the balance of brokered deposits at April 30, 2010. All brokered deposits are
FDIC insured.  The Bank attempts to compete for deposits with other institutions in its market area by offering competitively
priced deposit instruments that are tailored to the needs of its customers. Additionally, the Bank seeks to meet customers needs by providing convenient customer service to the community. With the exception of brokered deposits, substantially
all of the Banks depositors are Kentucky or Tennessee residents who reside in the Banks market area.

 Certificates of deposit at December 31, 2011, included approximately $272.5 million of deposits with
balances of $100,000 or more, compared to $289.1 million and $266.8 million at December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively. Such time deposits may be risky because their continued presence in the Bank is dependent partially upon
the rates paid by the Bank rather than any customer relationship and, therefore, may be withdrawn upon maturity if another institution offers higher interest rates. The Bank may be required to resort to other funding sources such as borrowings or
sales of its securities available for sale if the Bank believes that increasing its rates to maintain such deposits would adversely affect its operating results. At this time, the Bank does not believe that it will need to significantly increase its
deposit rates to maintain such certificates of deposit and, therefore, does not anticipate resorting to alternative funding sources. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The following table sets forth the deposit activities of the Bank for the periods indicated.

 Borrowings. Savings deposits historically have been the primary source of funds for the
Banks lending, investments and general operating activities. The Bank is authorized, however, to use advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of
Cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions.  As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to own stock in the FHLB of Cincinnati and is authorized to apply for advances. Advances are pursuant to several different programs, each of which has
its own interest rate and range of maturities. The Bank has entered into a Cash Management Advance program with FHLB. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati were $63.3 million at
December 31, 2011, and are secured by a blanket security agreement in which the Bank has pledged its 1-4 family first mortgage loans, multi-family residential real estate loans and non-residential real estate loan held in the Banks loan
portfolio.  On September 25, 2003, the Company issued $10,310,000 in floating rate junior subordinated debentures with a
thirty year maturity and callable at the Companys discretion quarterly after September 25, 2008. The subordinated debentures are priced at a variable rate equal to the three month Libor (London Inter Bank Offering Rate) plus 3.10%. At
December 31, 2011, the three-month Libor rate was 0.54%. The securities are immediately callable in the event of a change in tax or accounting law that has a significant negative impact to issuing these securities. 
  26 


For regulatory purposes, subordinated debentures may be treated as Tier I capital. Federal
regulations limit the use of subordinated debentures to 25% of total Tier I capital. Discussions among regulatory agencies are underway that may limit the current and future use of subordinated debentures as Tier I capital. The Companys
decision to issue subordinated debentures was in part influenced by potential regulatory actions in the future. The Company anticipates above average growth to continue and anticipates a time in the future when capital ratios are lower and
additional capital may be need.  In October of 2008, the Bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The agreement
calls for the Bank to pay a fixed rate of 7.27% until October 8, 2015, on $10 million and receive payment equal to the three month libor plus 3.10%. The Bank then completed an intercompany transaction that transferred the swap to the Company,
providing an effective hedge for its variable rate subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2011, the cost to the Bank to terminate the swap is approximately $1,297,000.  Repurchase Agreements  The Company offers cash management customers an
automated sweep account of excess funds from checking accounts into repurchase accounts. Prior to 2011, this product was the preferred method to provide commercial deposit customers the opportunity to earn interest income on demand deposit accounts.
Repurchase balances are overnight borrowings from customers and are not FDIC insured but are fully collateralized by specific securities in the Companys investment portfolio. In addition to customer repurchase agreements, the Company has two
long term repurchase agreements with large money center banks that are secured by individual investment securities. At December 31, 2011, the Companys retail repurchase agreements total $27.1 million and total long term repurchase
agreements of $16.0 million.  Subsidiary Activities  As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is permitted to invest an amount equal to 2% of its assets in subsidiaries, with an additional investment of 1% of assets where such investment serves
primarily community, inner-city and community development purposes. The Banks has two subsidiary organizations. The Banks insurance subsidiary, Fall and Fall Insurance Agency (Fall and Fall) of Fulton, Kentucky was acquired
in the Fulton acquisition on September 5, 2002. The Banks investment in the agency is approximately $830,000.  The
Company owns 99% of Fort Webb, LLC, a low income senior citizen housing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The facility offers apartments for rent for those senior citizens who qualify and is managed by the Bowling Green, Kentucky Housing
Authority. The Company realizes the tax benefits from the projects net operating loss over a fifteen year period. The Companys investment in the project is $420,000.  Competition  The Bank faces significant competition both in originating
mortgage and other loans and in attracting deposits. The Bank competes for loans principally on the basis of interest rates, the types of loans it originates, the deposit products it offers and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. The
Bank also competes by offering products which are tailored to the local community. Its competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real
estate located in the Banks market area. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. Competition may increase as a result of the continuing reduction of restrictions on the interstate
operations of financial institutions.  At June 30, 2011, the Bank had a 15.1% share of the deposit market in its combined
markets. The Banks most significant competition across its entire market area was Planters Bank of Kentucky with a 9.1% deposit market share and Branch Bank & Trust of North Carolina with an 8.3% deposit market share. In addition,
each market contains other community banks that provide competitive products and services within individual markets. 
  27 


The Bank attracts its deposits through its eighteen offices primarily from the local
community. Consequently, competition for deposits is principally from other savings institutions, commercial banks and brokers in the local community as well as from credit unions. The Bank competes for deposits and loans by offering what it
believes to be a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, a commitment to outstanding customer service and a well-trained staff. The Bank believes it has developed strong relationships with local realtors and the
community in general.  The Bank is a community and retail-oriented financial institution. Management considers the Banks
branch network and reputation for financial strength and quality customer service as its major competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers in its market area. A number of the Banks competitors have been acquired by
statewide/nationwide banking organizations. While the Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions which may have greater financial and marketing resources, management believes the Bank benefits by its community orientation and
its long-standing relationship with many of its customers.  Employees 
As of December 31, 2011, the Company and the Bank had 260 full-time and 11 part-time employees, none of whom were represented by a
collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the Banks relationships with its employees to be good.  Seasonality of Revenues
and Expenses  The Companys business is not materially affected by seasonality fluctuations in our business cycle. The
Company financial health is substantially affected by the overall business cycle and market interest rates.  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to affect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to
identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated our current primary federal regulator and subjects savings and loan holding
companies to greater regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally creates a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to have a significant impact on our business operations as
its provisions take effect. Among the provisions that are likely to affect us are the following:  Elimination of OTS.
The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in the elimination of the OTS, which was our primary federal regulator and the primary federal regulator of the Bank until July 21, 2011. The current primary federal regulator of HopFed Bancorp, Inc. is the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB), and the primary federal regulator for the Bank is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The FRB and OCC have rulemaking, examination, supervision and oversight
authority over our operations and the FDIC will retain secondary authority over the Bank. OTS guidance, orders, interpretations, policies and similar items under which we and other savings and loan holding companies and federal savings associations
operate will continue to remain in effect until they are superseded by new guidance and policies from the OCC or Federal Reserve.  Holding Company Capital Requirements. Effective as of the transfer date, the Federal Reserve is authorized to establish capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies. These capital
requirements must be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Savings and loan holding companies are now
required to serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. Leverage capital requirements and risk-based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and banking holding companies will be extended
to thrift holding companies. However, the FRB has not yet issued regulations regarding the levels of these capital requirements or when they will apply to the Company. 
  28 


Under these standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital
unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by a bank or savings and loan holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. The Company has trust preferred securities, but is exempt from these standards. 
Federal Preemption. A major benefit of the federal thrift charter has been the strong preemptive effect of the Home Owners
Loan Act (HOLA), under which we are chartered. Historically, the courts have interpreted the HOLA to occupy the field with respect to the operations of federal thrifts, leaving no room for conflicting state regulation. The
Dodd-Frank Act, however, amends the HOLA to specifically provide that it does not occupy the field in any area of state law. Henceforth, any preemption determination must be made in accordance with the standards applicable to national banks, which
have themselves been scaled back to require case-by-case determinations of whether state consumer protection laws discriminate against national banks or interfere with the exercise of their powers before these laws may be pre-empted. 
Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions
and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and extends unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2013. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC
insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund
from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal statutory
prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts.  Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Under the
Dodd-Frank Act, a savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is prohibited from paying dividends, except for dividends that: (i) would be permissible for a national bank; (ii) are necessary to meet obligations of a
company that controls the savings association; and (iii) are specifically approved by the OCC and the FRB. In addition, a savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is deemed to have violated Section 5 of the Home
Owners Loan Act and is subject to enforcement actions thereunder.  Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act
requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called
golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. The new legislation also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a companys
proxy materials. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0
billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act gave the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters. 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted say-on-pay rules. Under these rules, smaller reporting companies such as the
Company are not required to conduct say-on-pay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2013. In adopting the two-year deferral period, the SEC stated that it may adjust the rule before it applies to smaller
issuers.  Also pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act the SEC proposed a so-called proxy access rule. However, in July
2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the SECs proposed rule, and the SEC subsequently announced that it would not dispute the Courts decision. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of affiliate for purposes of quantitative
and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or its affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act applies to Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve
Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transaction that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider. Any such transactions with affiliates must be
fully secured. The current exemption from Section 23A for transactions with financial subsidiaries is eliminated. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider
unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by the disinterested directors.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been granted broad
rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt
Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in
assets. Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. 
  29 


The CFPB has the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection
with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrowers ability to repay.
 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than
a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state
attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, has also been
modified by the Dodd-Frank Act and now requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the OCC and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank. Depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations
of the Bank are subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates.  Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges.

Limitations on Capital Distributions. The FRB regulations impose limitations upon
capital distributions by savings institutions, such as cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital.
Under the FRB capital distribution regulations, a savings institution that (i) qualifies for expedited treatment of applications by maintaining one of the two highest supervisory examination ratings, (ii) will be at least adequately
capitalized after the proposed capital distribution and (iii) and is not otherwise restricted by applicable law in making capital distributions may, without prior approval by the FRB, make capital distributions during a calendar year equal to
its net income for such year plus its retained net income for the preceding two years. Capital distributions in excess of such amount would require prior Fed approval. However, given the current economic climate, FRB has publically stated that it is
carefully reviewing every dividend request and has informed the Company that it must seek approval prior to any future declaration of dividends to common shareholders.  As a participant in the United States Treasurys Capital Purchase Program, the Company was required to obtain prior written approval before it increased the amount of dividends paid to common
shareholders prior to December 12, 2011. In the event that the Company fails to make a scheduled dividend payment to preferred shareholders or interest payments on trust preferred securities, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividends
to common shareholders.  As a condition in the Companys MOU signed April 30, 2010, the Company must make a request
to the FRB prior to the payment of any dividends from either the Bank to the Company or from the Company to its common shareholders. The Company may continue to pay dividends on preferred stock and interest on subordinated debentures as long as the
Banks Tier 1 Capital Ratio exceeds 9% and its Total Risk Based Capital Exceeds 12%. At December 31, 2011, the Banks Tier 1 and Total Risk Based Capital Ratios were 10.18% and 17.63%, respectively. 
Future earnings of the Bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment
of dividends or other distributions to the Company without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the Bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Generally, transactions between a savings bank or its subsidiaries and its affiliates
are required to be on terms as favorable to the savings bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the savings banks capital.
Affiliates of the Bank include the Company and any company that is under common control with the Bank. In addition, a savings bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire the
securities of most affiliates. The OCC has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of savings banks as affiliates on a case-by-case basis.  Certain transactions with directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations enforced by the OCC. These conflict of interest regulations and other statutes
also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests. Among other things, such loans must generally be made on terms that are substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals. 
Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, all FDIC-insured depository institutions must maintain average daily
reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. The Bank met these reserve requirements at December 31, 2011.  Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System consists of 12 district Federal Home Loan Banks subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board
(FHFB). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to
1% of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB, whichever is greater. The Bank was in compliance with
this requirement, with a $4.4 million investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2011.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Financial Stability
Plan, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, and Other Regulatory Developments 
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  On October 3, 2008, the EESA was enacted, enabling the federal government to insure troubled assets of financial institutions and collect fees from institutions participating in this program under
the terms and conditions set forth by the Secretary of the Treasury. EESA includes, among other provisions: (a) the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), under which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to
purchase, insure, hold, and sell a wide variety of financial instruments, particularly those that are based on or related to residential or commercial mortgages originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008; and (b) an increase in the
amount of deposit insurance provided by the FDIC.  Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) 
Under TARP, the United States Department of the Treasury authorized a voluntary capital purchase program (CPP) to purchase up
to $250 billion of senior preferred shares of qualifying financial institutions that elected to participate. Participating companies must adopt certain standards for executive compensation, including prohibiting golden parachute payments
as defined in EESA to senior Executive Officers; (b) requiring recovery of any compensation paid to senior Executive Officers based on criteria that is later proven to be materially inaccurate; and (c) prohibiting incentive compensation
that encourages unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution. The terms of the CPP also limit certain uses of capital by the issuer, including repurchases of company stock and increases in dividends paid to
common shareholders.  On December 12, 2008, the Company agreed to participate in the CPP and issued and sold 18,400
shares of preferred stock for $18.4 million. The preferred stock pays a cash dividend of 5% per year for the first five years and then increases to 9% per year thereafter. In addition, the Company issued the United States Treasury warrants
to purchase up to 243,816 shares of its common stock at a strike price of $11.32 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and have a ten year final maturity. The warrants outstanding were adjusted to 248,692 shares and the strike price
was adjusted to $11.098 per share as a result of a 2% stock dividend paid to shareholders of record at September 30, 2010. In October of 2011, the warrants outstanding were again adjusted to 253,666 shares and the strike price was adjusted to
$10.88 per share as a result of a 2% stock dividend paid to shareholders of record at October 3, 2011.  Financial Stability Plan
 The Financial Stability Plan (FSP) is a comprehensive set of measures intended to improve the health of the
financial system. The key elements of the FSP include making additional capital injections into financial institutions, creating a private  public investment fund to buy troubled assets, establishing guidelines for loan modification programs
and expanding the Federal Reserve lending program.  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted. ARRA is intended to provide
a stimulus to the United States economy in the wake of the economic downturn brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting liquidity and credit crunch. The bill includes federal tax cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits and other
social welfare provisions, and domestic spending in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, including the energy structure. The new law also includes numerous non-economic recovery related items, including a limitation on executive compensation
in federally aided banks. 
  32 


Under ARRA, an institution will be subject to the following restrictions and standards
through out the period of which any obligation arising from the financial assistance provide under TARP remains outstanding:   


 

 
 Limits on incentive compensation for risk taking by senior executive officers. 
 


 

 
 Claw Back provisions for compensation paid based or inaccurate financial information. 
 


 

 
 Prohibition on Golden Parachute Payments. 
 


 

 
 Limitations on luxury expenditures.   


 

 
 TARP recipients are required to permit a separate shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to the SECs
compensation disclosure rules.   


 

 
 Publically registered TARP recipients must establish a board compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors, for the purpose of
reviewing employee compensation plans.  SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provided for sweeping changes with respect to corporate governance, accounting policies and disclosure requirements
for public companies, and also for their directors and officers. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act required the SEC to adopt new rules to implement the Acts requirements. These requirements include new financial reporting requirements and rules
concerning the chief executive and chief financial officers to certify certain financial and other information included in the companys quarterly and annual reports. The rules also require these officers to certify that they are responsible
for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures; and that they have included information in their quarterly and annual filings about their evaluation and whether there
have been significant changes to the controls and procedures or other factors which would significantly impact these controls subsequent to their evaluation. The certifications by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the financial statements and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K. See Item 9A (Controls and Procedures) hereof for the Companys evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures.  Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required under
rules adopted by the SEC to include in its annual reports a report by management on the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditors report. In September 2005, the SEC extended the Section 404
compliance date for the Company and other non-accelerated filers. Under the extension, the Company is required to comply with these requirements.  USA Patriot Act  The USA Patriot Act authorizes new regulatory powers to
combat international terrorism. The provisions that affect financial institutions most directly provide the federal government with enhanced authority to identify, deter, and punish international money laundering and other crimes. Among other
things, the USA Patriot Act prohibits financial institutions from doing business with foreign shell banks and requires increased due diligence for private banking transactions and correspondent accounts for foreign banks. In addition,
financial institutions have to follow minimum verification of identity standards for all new accounts and are permitted to share information with law enforcement authorities under circumstances that were not previously permitted. 
Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income borrowers in their local
communities. An institutions size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. Large, retail-oriented institutions are examined using a performance-based lending, investment and service
test. Small institutions are examined using a streamlined approach. All institutions may opt to be evaluated under a strategic plan formulated with community input and pre-approved by the bank regulatory agency. 
  33 


The Community Reinvestment Act regulations provide for certain disclosure
obligations. Each institution must post a notice advising the public of its right to comment to the institution and its regulator on the institutions Community Reinvestment Act performance and to review the institutions Community
Reinvestment Act public file. Each lending institution must maintain for public inspection a file that includes a listing of branch locations and services, a summary of lending activity, a map of its communities and any written comments from
the public on its performance in meeting community credit needs. The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of a financial institutions written Community Reinvestment Act evaluations. This promotes enforcement of
Community Reinvestment Act requirements by providing the public with the status of a particular institutions community reinvestment record.  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made various changes to the Community Reinvestment Act. Among other changes, Community Reinvestment Act agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual
Community Reinvestment Act reports must be made available to a banks primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its latest Community Reinvestment Act examination.
 Forward-Looking Statements  This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including all documents incorporated herein by reference, contains forward-looking statements. Additional written or oral forward-looking statements may be made by the
Company from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise. The words believe, expect, seek, and intend and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date the statement is made. Such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, projections of income or loss, expenditures, acquisitions, plans for future operations, financing needs or plans relating to services of the Company, as well as assumptions relating to
the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or
underlying the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to
publicly release the results of revisions which may be made to forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. 
 


Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS  The Company could
experience an increase in loan losses, which would reduce the Companys earnings.  As the nation continues to suffer
from an economic recession, real estate prices remain under pressure in the Companys market. Furthermore, elevated levels of unemployment have made it difficult for many consumers to meet their monthly obligations. The deployment of military
personnel out of Fort Campbell to the Middle East may reduce both demand for and pricing of all types of real estate in the Companys largest market. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans
according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. As discussed in Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has significant exposure to
various types of real estate loans, including commercial real estate, land and land development loans, construction loans, multi-family real estate and loans for residential homes. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and our
industry has seen above average loan loss levels for approximately eighteen months. While the Company believes that its loan underwriting standards have been and remain sound, the Company has experienced an increase in charge offs and non-performing
loans. To the extent charge offs exceed our financial models, increased amounts charged to the provision for loan losses would reduce net income. 
  34 


Rapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest margin, net interest income,
fee income and net income.  Interest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are
a large part of our net income. Interest rates are the key drivers of the Companys net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in
interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in the maturities of the Companys assets and liabilities. Furthermore, substantially higher rates generally reduce loan
demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net
interest income. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  Liquidity needs could adversely affect the
Companys results of operations and financial condition.  The Company relies on dividends from the Bank as a primary
source of funds. The Banks primary source of funds is customer deposits and cash flows from investment instruments and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source, they are subject to the ability of the
borrowers to repay their loans. The ability of the borrowers to repay their loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting the business environment, natural
disasters and various other factors. Cash flows from the investment portfolio may be affected by changes in interest rates, resulting in excessive levels of cash flow during periods of declining interest rates and lower levels of cash flow during
periods of rising interest rates. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including both the national market and local competitive interest rate environment, local and national economic conditions, natural disasters and other various
events. Accordingly, the Company may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include the FHLB advances, brokered deposits and federal funds lines
of credit from correspondent banks.  The Company may also pledge investments as collateral to borrow money from third parties.
In certain cases, the Company may sell investment instruments for sizable losses to meet liquidity needs, hurting net income. While the Company believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to
meet future liquidity needs.  The financial industry is very competitive. 
We face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our market area.
Our competitors include other community banks, regional and super-regional banking institutions, national banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund
companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than HopFed Bancorp, Inc.  Inability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues and net income. 
We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit
portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting, hiring, and
training expenses, resulting in lower net income. 
  35 


The Company is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities.
 The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive
regulation by various federal agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Companys regulatory compliance is costly and certain types of activities, including the payment
of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged and interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices are subject to regulatory approval and may be limited by regulation. The Company is also subject to
capitalization guidelines established by its regulators, which require it and the Bank to maintain adequate capital to support its and the Banks growth.  The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and the Company cannot predict the effects of these changes on its business and profitability. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ National Market that are now and will be applicable to the Company, have increased the scope, complexity, and cost of corporate
governance, reporting and disclosure practices. As a result, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, greater compliance cost.  Legislation was enacted on July 21, 2010 that will implement sweeping changes to the current bank regulatory structure. The Dodd-Frank eliminated the OTS. The Comptroller of the Currency (the primary
federal regulator for national banks) will become the primary federal regulator of the Bank. The FRB now has exclusive authority to regulate all bank and thrift holding companies. As a result, the Company is now subject to supervision by the FRB as
opposed to the OTS. These changes occurred July 21, 2011.  Among the many requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act for new
banking regulations is a requirement for new capital regulations to be adopted within 18 months. These regulations must be at least as stringent as, and may call for higher levels of capital than, current regulations. Generally, trust preferred
securities will no longer be eligible as Tier 1 capital, but the Companys currently outstanding trust preferred securities will be grandfathered. Savings and loan holding companies like the Company have not previously been subject to capital
requirements, but under the Dodd-Frank Act, five years from the date of enactment, savings and loan holding companies will become subject to the same capital requirements as bank holding companies. Savings and loan holding companies are immediately
subject to the source of strength doctrine, under which a holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries.  The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes a new minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund of 1.35%, and requires the FDIC to take steps to reach this ratio by September 30, 2020. It is expected
that this will result in relatively higher assessments for larger institutions (with assets greater than $10 billion).  Even though the
Companys common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ National Market, the trading volume in the Companys common stock has been low and the sale of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could depress the price of
the Companys common stock.  The trading volume of the Companys common stock on The NASDAQ National Market has
been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on The NASDAQ National Market or other stock exchanges. Thinly traded stocks, such as the Companys, can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Because of
this, the Company stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.  The
Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or availability of shares of its common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market prices of the Companys common stock. The Company,
therefore, can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sale in the market, would not cause the price of its common stock to decline or impair the Companys
ability to raise capital through sales of its common stock. 
  36 


The market price of the Companys common stock may fluctuate in the future, and these
fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market prices declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Companys common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of
future market prices.  The current banking crisis, including the enactment of Emergency Economic Stabilization Action (EESA) and American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), have significantly affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or stock price.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year. In recent months, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the
markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seeming without regard to that issuers underlying financial strength.  EESA, which established the TARP, was signed into law in October 2008. As part of TARP, the Treasury established the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) to provide up to $700 billion of funding to eligible
financial institutions through the purchase of preferred shares and other financial instruments with the stated purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. On December 12, 2008, the Company accepted an $18.4
million treasury investment of preferred stock with terms that included a 5% dividend that increases to 9% after five years. The Company issued 243,816 common stock warrants that are immediately issued and have a strike price of $11.32 and have a
ten year maturity. The amount of common warrants outstanding has been adjusted to 253,666 and the strike price adjusted to $10.88 as a result of a 2% common stock dividend paid on October 18, 2010, to shareholders of record on
September 30, 2010, and October 20, 2011, to shareholders of record on October 3, 2011.  On February 17,
2009, President Obama signed ARRA, an economic recovery package intended to stimulate the economy and provide for a broad range of infrastructure, energy, health and educational needs. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact that EESA or
its programs, including the CPP, and the ARRA or its programs, will have on the national economy or financial markets. The failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and the continuation or worsening of
current financial market conditions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common shares.  The Corporation and the Bank each are required to comply with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) issued by the OTS and currently enforced by the OCC and FRB and lack of compliance could
result in monetary penalties and/or regulatory actions.  On April 30, 2010, the Company and the Bank each entered into
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). This informal agreement places additional reporting and operational requirements on the Company and Bank. The Bank is required to reduce the level of
commercial real estate loans to Total Risk Based Capital. This requirement may result in lower levels of commercial real estate loans, reducing the Banks ability to continue to pursue its current strategy to grow its loan portfolio and net
interest income. The OCC and the FRB have now assumed responsibility for monitoring the Banks and Companys compliance with the MOU.  The MOU will remain in effect until stayed, modified, terminated or superseded by the FRB and OCC were to determine that the Company or the Bank were not in compliance with their respective MOUs, it would
have available numerous remedies. Management continues to take actions necessary to comply with the MOUs requirements. The OCC may determine, however, in its sole discretion that the issues raised have not been addressed satisfactorily, or any
current or past action, violation or deficiencies could be subject to future regulatory enforcement actions. Such enforcement actions could result in penalties or additional limitations on the Companys business. 
  37 


There can be no assurance of whether or when the Company may pay dividends in the future. Cash available to
pay dividend to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, is limited by regulatory
and legal restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital at the Bank.  The MOU with the FRB restricts us from declaring or paying
any dividends or other capital distributions to common shareholders without prior FRB approval. This dividend restriction does not apply to cash dividends on currently outstanding shares on Series A Preferred Stock issued to and held by the United
States Department of the Treasury and obligations in connection with currently outstanding trust preferred securities, provided that such dividend payment or distribution of capital does not cause the Banks capital levels to fall below a Tier
1 core capital ratio of 8.00% and a total risk based capital of 12.00%. We may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business. We are restricted from
paying dividends if we have deferred payments of the interest on, or an event of default has occurred with respect to, our trust preferred securities or Series A Preferred Stock.  The Company conducts virtually all of its business activities in a geographically concentrated area of Middle and West Tennessee and Western Kentucky. 
The Company operates eighteen offices located in Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky. The Company maintains significant business relationships in the
markets in which it operates as well as the communities adjoining our offices. Therefore, the Companys success is directly tied to the economic viability of our markets which may not be representative of the country as a whole. In 2011, the
Companys market had unemployment rates ranging from 8% to 12%. While the Company believes that its credit quality has been strong given the current environment, continued economic stress in the market may result in an increase in
non-performing loans and charge offs. Given the limited geographic footprint of our Company, the economic conditions in our marketplace may not be reflective of the entire nation.  Managements analysis of the necessary funding for the allowance for loan loss account may be incorrect or may suddenly change, resulting in lower earnings. 
The funding of the allowance for loan loss account is the most significant estimate made by management in its financial reporting to shareholders and
regulators. If negative changes to the performance of the Companys loan portfolio were to occur, management may find it necessary or be required to funding the allowance for loan loss account through additional charges to the Companys
provision for loan loss expense. These changes may occur suddenly and be dramatic in nature. These changes are likely to affect the Companys financial performance, capital levels and stock price. 
A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the
unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.  Our businesses are dependent on
their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients,
often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging,
particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result
of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber-attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.

  38 


In addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and
other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor
to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including
confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our
internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application
developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. 
We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business
activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as
interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients systems. 
Although we have not experienced a cyber-incident, if one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary
and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients or other third parties, operations, which could
result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cyber-incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost
revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.  We maintain an
insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that this policy would be sufficient to cover all financial
losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third partys systems failing or experiencing attack.  Our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss which could lead to higher loan losses and non-accrual assets.  We originate commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within our market area. Commercial real estate, commercial, and
construction and development loans tend to involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and are most susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans also have historically had
greater credit risk than other loans for the following reasons:   


 

 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt
service. These loans also involve greater risk because they may not be fully amortizing over a loan period, but may have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrowers ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to
either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. As of December 31, 2011, commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans comprised approximately 38.2% of our total loan portfolio, or 169.3% of the Companys total risk
based capital.   


 

 
 Commercial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrowers business. In addition, the collateral
securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2011, commercial loans comprised approximately 9.7% of our total loan portfolio,
or 42.6% of the Companys consolidated total risk based capital. 
  39 




 

 
 Construction and Development Loans. The risk of loss is largely dependent on our initial estimate of whether the propertys value at
completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If our estimate is inaccurate or if actual
construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. As of December 31, 2011,
construction, land and land development loans comprised approximately 11.3% of our total loan portfolio and approximately 50.0% of the Companys consolidated total risk based capital. 
The increased risks associated with these types of loans result in a correspondingly higher probability of default on such loans (as compared to
single-family real estate loans). Loan defaults would likely increase our loan losses and non-accrual assets and could adversely affect our allowance for loan losses.  Since we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with
the ownership of real property, which could result in reduced net income.  Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to
foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we are exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. 
The amount that we, as mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to general and
local economic conditions, changing values of property, interest rates, unpaid real estate taxes, environmental issues, operating expenses involved with managing other real estate owned, and the supply and demand for units held for sale as well as
other unforeseen cost and delays.  Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and
maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment or we
may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss.  The downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and Europes debt crisis could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.  Standard & Poors lowered its long term
sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011. A further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the
United States and worldwide. Any such adverse impact could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the possibility that certain European Union (EU) member states will default on their debt obligations has negatively impacted economic conditions and global markets. The continued
uncertainty over the outcome of international and the EUs financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets. The negative impact on
economic conditions and global markets could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

Management Report on Internal Control 
The management of HopFed Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company) is responsible for the preparation,
integrity and fair presentation of published financial statements and all other information presented in this annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) and, as such, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates made by management.  Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with GAAP. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and included those policies and procedures that:   


 

 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company.   


 

 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Company; and 
 


 

 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures include in such controls may deteriorate.  Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control
 Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that HopFed Bancorps internal control over financial reporting is effective as of
December 31, 2011.  This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that
permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.
