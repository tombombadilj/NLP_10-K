Business Overview 
Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ESI) is a leading supplier of innovative laser-based manufacturing solutions for
the microtechnology industry. Our advanced laser systems enable precise structuring of micron to submicron features in components and devices which are used in a wide variety of end products in the consumer electronics, computer, communications and
other industries. These features enable our customers to achieve functionality, or improve yield and productivity in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability. Founded in 1944, ESI is headquartered in Portland,
Oregon, with global operations and subsidiaries in Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States.  Our advanced laser
microfabrication systems allow microelectronics, semiconductor, and other microtechnology manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high-volume production in order to increase performance and improve production yields. Laser
microfabrication comprises a set of precise micron-level processes, including via drilling, wafer scribing and dicing, material ablation, semiconductor memory-link cutting, electronic device trimming, and nano-level structuring to alter material
characteristics such as color and texture. These processes require application-specific laser systems able to meet our customers exacting performance and productivity requirements. Our laser-based systems improve production yields or enable
improved performance for flexible interconnect material, semiconductor devices, light emitting diodes (LEDs), high-density interconnect (HDI) circuits, advanced semiconductor packaging, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and other high value
components.  Additionally, we produce high-capacity test and inspection equipment that is critical to the quality control
process during the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). Our equipment ensures that each component meets the electrical and physical tolerances required to perform properly. We also produce products building on this technology that
are used to test the electrical and optical characteristics, including wavelength, or color, and intensity, of packaged LEDs.

Table of Contents
Industry Overview  The microelectronics and semiconductor industries continue to be driven by demand for advanced features and improved functionality in increasingly smaller and smarter consumer devices. The technologies
for consumer-oriented electronics such as smart phones, tablets, personal computers, mobile computing devices, video games and high-definition televisions have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that offer
more functionality in smaller packages. In addition, semiconductor and other advanced technologies are being used in a broadening set of markets and applications, including LEDs, solar, automotive, medical and security. 
These dynamics in turn are driving the need for faster, smaller, more complex, less expensive and higher-quality electronic devices and
components. To achieve these improvements, component and other device manufacturers are increasing the circuit densities in these devices and investing in new technologies.  For example, smaller and lighter semiconductor devices are driving the need to shrink the physical dimensions of the semiconductor packaging and the HDI circuit board on which they are mounted. Higher
operating speeds of computers and communication products require more input and output channels within these packages and between the packages and the HDI circuit board. These trends require smaller, more accurate, and precisely tapered or shaped
holes, known as vias, to create connections between layers and interconnecting devices. This trend is driving the use of an increasing amount of flexible interconnect between printed circuit boards (PCBs) and other components. These flexible
circuits require the smallest and most accurate vias to create the connections between these devices.  In addition, the
ability to shrink the actual dimensions of a device is becoming increasingly more difficult, and producers are investing in new technologies, such as stacking thin silicon wafers into advanced three dimensional (3D) chip packages. We believe
this trend will drive additional applications for laser processing, including scribing and dicing of ultra-thin wafers and drilling of through silicon vias (TSV).  Smaller and more complex devices also require more capacitance to be designed into the circuit. This has resulted in a significant increase in the use of smaller, higher-capacitance passive components
such as MLCCs. In calendar year 2011, estimated production of MLCCs was over 2 trillion units. These MLCCs must be tested electrically and optically to characterize performance and ensure reliability. Automated equipment to test these MLCCs in the
manufacturing environment, like our high capacitance tester, can test and sort up to 750,000 parts per hour.  Variations of
advanced semiconductor technologies and manufacturing processes are increasingly being employed in the production of other types of devices and components, including LEDs. For example, automated laser-based systems, like our AccuScribe 2210 series,
are used to scribe the sapphire wafer to separate individual devices in the production of LEDs. LEDs are increasingly utilized in electronics, display, automotive and general lighting applications. 
A significant portion of our business is derived from specialized microfabrication applications. Any material that can be cut, drilled,
etched, or otherwise surface treated using a mechanical process can be microfabricated with greater precision and accuracy using a laser-based solution. As consumer electronics and other products or devices become more compact, mechanical processes
will not be able to meet the stringent specifications demanded by producers. We believe the capabilities of laser-based solutions for microfabrication will enable our customers to move beyond the limitations of mechanical processes and generate
significant growth for us in the future.  Our Solutions  We believe our products address the needs of microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturers by providing them with a high return on their investment due to measurable production benefits such as
improved yield, increased throughput, higher performance, continued miniaturization and greater reliability.

Increase the value of our products to global customers 
We are focused on improving our customers yield, throughput and productivity by utilizing our technology, global infrastructure,
customer service and ability to integrate multiple technologies. We work with our market-leading, global customers through high-level, multi-disciplinary management and employee teams to define and produce the next generation of manufacturing
systems. This requires confidential interaction between the customer and ESI, sharing technology and product roadmaps often looking out over a three- to five-year period. Our increased presence in Asia has allowed us to form even closer
relationships with key customers in that region.  Our Products  We operate in one segment, high-technology manufacturing equipment, which is comprised of products that are organized in three groups: interconnect & microfabrication, semiconductor and
components.  Interconnect & Microfabrication Group (IMG) 
Our Interconnect & Microfabrication Group products address an expanding number of applications and materials on a broad set of
substrates, including panels, continuous-feed reels, and discrete three dimensional components or devices.  Interconnect Via Drilling
 For electrical interconnect applications, our laser microvia engineering systems target applications that require the
highest accuracy and smallest via (hole) dimensions to create electrical connections between layers in flexible circuits, high-density circuit boards and IC packages. Our microvia drilling technology addresses the rapidly changing applications in IC
packages, multichip modules and HDI circuit boards. Our ultraviolet (UV) laser processing systems employ state-of-the-art technology in lasers, optics and motion control. These products include single-beam and multi-beam systems that produce
high-quality vias with the best-in-class placement accuracy for improved yield of packages and substrates.  Advanced Microfabrication
 Our systems can be configured with a variety of lasers and material handling devices that make them ideal for other
advanced laser-based microfabrication applications. As technologies enable shrinking sizes and consumer electronics and other devices become more compact, mechanical processes are not able to meet the stringent specifications demanded by
manufacturers. We offer several platforms that enable customers to perform precision drilling, scribing, etching, routing or nano-structuring in many different types of materials and devices including glass, metal, plastic, paint and ceramics. The
processed material or device is used in many different end markets including microelectronics, computer, medical, energy and display. Our model ML5900 is a particularly versatile platform optimized for industrial production and includes integrated
inspection and a rotary stage for parallel processing of devices. We believe the capabilities of laser-based solutions for microfabrication will enable our customers to move beyond the limitations of mechanical processes. We also offer laser
ablation systems that ablate material for identification and analysis applications, including forensics, mineral analysis and research.  In September 2010, we acquired PyroPhotonics Lasers, Inc., a manufacturer of tailored-pulse fiber lasers. These lasers are used extensively in our memory repair systems. We believe this laser technology
can also be utilized in solar and other microfabrication applications.  Semiconductor Group (SG) 
Our Semiconductor Group products address multiple applications that utilize laser energy to process materials on wafer-based substrates.
This includes traditional silicon wafers, LEDs wafers, and new ultrathin silicon wafers used in the three-dimensional (3D) packaging applications.

Semiconductor Memory Yield Improvement Systems 
Our semiconductor memory yield improvement products are designed to cost-effectively meet the production challenges faced by semiconductor
manufacturers, including shrinking circuit sizes, material changes and increasing numbers of memory devices per wafer. As circuit densities in semiconductor memory devices such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) have increased, manufacturers
have built redundant cells into their memory designs and connected them with small electrical links on the device surface. During the manufacturing process, wafers with billions of individual memory cells are tested to identify defective cells. Our
laser systems are then used to cut links that reprogram the device by disconnecting the paths to defective portions of the memory device and replacing them with functional redundant cells. This process enables significant post-repair yield
improvements that are essential to our customers profitability.  Our 98XX series systems are designed specifically for
the 300mm wafer processing market but can also handle 200mm wafers. Our systems can be configured for multiple colors including infrared, green and UV. With the introduction of our 9850TPIR+ Dual-Beam, Tailored-Pulse Laser Link-Processing system, we
offer unmatched flexibility in processing complex, next-generation fuse designs and materials. In addition, our dual-beam architecture provides significant throughput advantages compared to a single-beam repair tool. These high performance systems
deliver increased manufacturing productivity and lower cost of ownership.  Ultra-Thin Silicon Wafer Processing 
The advent of 3D chip packaging technologies is driving the need for silicon wafers to become thinner in order to allow for stacking of
wafers within the same packaging geometry. As wafers become thinner, they become more challenging to cut into discrete chips using traditional mechanical saws. Our model 9900 uses a laser to dice ultra-thin silicon wafers, those with a thickness of
50 microns or below. The model 9900 also enables 3D packaging through its ability to process through-silicon vias that are key to electrically connecting the stacked wafers. As 3D technologies are developed, we believe the use of lasers will become
increasingly important to productivity and performance.  LED Wafer Scribing 
Our AccuScribe line of sapphire wafer scribing systems is a key component in the manufacture of LEDs. During production, LEDs are created
on a thin wafer of synthetic sapphire crystal that must be broken into individual units at the end of the process. The brittle nature of the sapphire wafer requires that it be carefully cut in order to prevent unwanted fractures and yield losses
when the wafer is broken apart into discrete LEDs. The AccuScribe systems use a laser to scribe the wafer with a precise groove between individual LEDs. When mechanical force is applied to the wafer, it fractures along these grooves and allows the
wafer to be split apart into discrete LEDs.  As requirements for the light output of LEDs increase, driven by general
illumination, the challenges to scribe the wafer without damaging the device and impacting the light output become more difficult. We believe our new AccuScribe 2600 will enable the scribing of these devices without impacting light output and will
be capable of scribing the most advanced LED designs for general illumination applications.  LCD Repair 
Our laser LCD repair systems are critical to improving yields in the manufacture of flat panel displays. During production, individual
pixels of a display may develop electrical defects that result in no light emission or the emission of only a steady white light. To correct these defects, flat panel display producers employ a laser repair process to isolate the electrical defects
during production by cutting the inputs to the pixel. Our laser systems are primarily sold to the manufacturers of LCD repair tools as a key component of their products.

Table of Contents
Components Group (CG)  We design and manufacture products that combine high-speed small parts handling technology with real-time control systems to provide highly automated, cost-effective solutions for manufacturers of MLCCs
and other passive components such as capacitor arrays, inductors, resistors, varistors and hybrid circuits. These components, produced in quantities of trillions of units per year, process analog, digital and high-frequency signals and are used
extensively in nearly all electronic products.  We provide several types of products and solutions in this market. Our MLCC
test systems employ high-speed handling and positioning techniques to precisely load, test and sort MLCCs based on their electrical energy storage capacity, or capacitance, and their electrical energy leakage, or dissipation factor. Our 35XX series
is the most productive tester in the market today and continues to gain acceptance with major MLCC manufacturers that have traditionally developed and used their own in-house systems. Our latest 3510 model enables high speed testing of the
industrys smallest metric 0402 capacitors used primarily in advanced cell phone and tablet designs. Circuit fine-tuning systems are application-specific laser systems that adjust the electrical performance of a hybrid circuit, or that adjust
an electronic assembly containing many circuits, by removing a precise amount of material from one or more circuit components. Finally, we produce consumable products such as carrier plates and termination belts, both of which are used to hold MLCCs
during the manufacturing and testing process.  We have applied our proprietary handling technologies used for MLCC test to
develop the 3800 LED Package Test System to perform high speed optical and visual test of packaged LEDs. Packaged LEDs are sorted by light output and color to enable the manufacturer to optimize price and color matching of the devices. We believe
our technologies provide superior yield and throughput over existing tools.  Customers 
Our top ten customers for 2012, 2011 and 2010 accounted for approximately 56%, 62% and 56% of total net sales, respectively. One customer,
Apple Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 29%, 24% and 30% of total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd., each individually accounted for approximately 11% of
total net sales. No other customer individually accounted for more than 10% of total net sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010.  See
Note 23 Product and Geographic Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for our net sales by geographic area.

Table of Contents

revenue. Backlog was $69.1 million at March 31, 2012 compared to $65.5 million at April 2, 2011, representing an increase of 5% driven by timing of shipments. The stated backlog is not
necessarily indicative of sales for any future period, because of possible order cancellations or deferrals, shipping or acceptance delays, nor does backlog represent any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders. 
Research, Development and Technology  We believe that our ability to compete effectively and deliver customer solutions depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand our expertise in core technologies and product applications. Our
primary core competencies and capabilities include:   


 

 
 lasers and laser/material interaction;   


 

 
 high-speed, micron-level motion control systems;   


 

 
 precision optics;   


 

 
 image processing and optical character recognition;   


 

 
 high-speed, small parts handling;   


 

 
 real-time production-line electronic measurement;


 
 systems integration.  Our research and development expenditures for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $42.6 million (17% of net sales), $41.1 million (16% of net sales) and $33.6 million (23% of net sales), respectively. 
Competition  Our markets
are dynamic, cyclical and highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, cost of ownership, ease of use, reliability, service, technical support, a product improvement path, price, proprietary
technology, manufacturing responsiveness and established relationships with customers, which includes familiarity with their products. We believe that our products compete favorably with respect to these factors. Some of our competitors have greater
financial, engineering and manufacturing resources and larger distribution networks than we do. Some of our customers develop, or have the ability to develop, manufacturing equipment similar to our products. Competition in our markets may intensify
and our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by competitors or customers or changes in electronic device processing technology. 
Our Interconnect & Microfabrication Group competes with laser systems provided by Hitachi Via Mechanics, Ltd., LPKF
Laser & Electronics AG, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and several Chinese and Korean companies who compete within their local markets. The principal competitor for our Semiconductor Group is GSI Group Inc. Competitors for LED scribing
include DISCO Corporation, JP Sercel Associates, Inc. and Laser Solutions, Inc. LCD repair competitors include Quantel USA, Inc. and HOYA Corporation. For the Components Group, our competitors include Humo Laboratory, Ltd., GSI Group Inc., Ismeca
Semiconductor SA, Shibuya Kogya Co., Ltd. and Tokyo Weld Co., Ltd. as well as component manufacturers that develop systems for internal use. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
Our primary production facilities are located in Singapore; Portland, Oregon; Klamath Falls, Oregon; and Beijing, China. Our Singapore
facility is our primary systems manufacturing facility and manufactures certain IMG, LED, CG and laser ablation products. The Portland facility manufactures our SG products and provides 
  7

advanced manufacturing and prototype capability. The Klamath Falls facility manufactures CG consumable products. The Beijing facility manufactures certain laser products. Our Singapore and
Beijing, China, operations are located in leased facilities. As we continue our efforts to streamline the organization and improve efficiencies, we expect a growing percentage of final systems will be shipped from Singapore. 
We use qualified manufacturers to supply many components and sub-system modules for our products. Our systems use high-performance
computers, peripherals, lasers and other components from various suppliers. Some of the components we use are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a particular component would have a
temporary adverse impact on us. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are good.  Patents and Other Intellectual Property
 We have a policy of seeking patents, when appropriate, on inventions relating to new products and improvements that are
discovered or developed as part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities. We own 222 United States patents and 460 patents issued outside of the United States as of March 31, 2012. Additionally, as of March 31,
2012, we had 400 patent applications pending in the United States and 1,629 patent applications pending outside of the United States. Although our patents are important, we believe that the competitiveness of our products also depends on the
technical competence and innovation of our employees.  We rely on copyright protection for our proprietary software. We also
rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
 Employees 
As of March 31, 2012, we employed 627 people. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our
ability to attract and retain such employees, who are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee
relations to be good.  Environmental Compliance  During fiscal 2012, we retained ISO 14001 certification via surveillance audit for our environmental management system for our Portland, Oregon operations. We do not expect compliance with
international, federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted related to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank act enacted in July 2011 requires disclosure about the use of certain specified conflict minerals emanating from Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring
counties. We await issuance of the final rules surrounding the disclosure requirements from the SEC which will enable estimation of compliance costs.

Risks Related to Our Competition and Customers  Volatility of Our Customers Industries  Our business is
dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of microelectronics, semiconductors and light emitting diodes (LEDs) used in consumer electronics, computers, wireless communications and other electronic products. The capital equipment
market for microelectronics, semiconductor and consumer electronics manufacturers has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand due to a number of factors including capacity utilization,
timing of customers new product introductions and demand for their products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital. The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult or impossible to predict.
As a result, business levels can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year. Significant downturns in the market for microelectronics, semiconductors, and LEDs used in electronic devices or in the market for consumer electronics
reduce demand for our products and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, starting in the second half of fiscal 2012, we experienced the negative impact of an uncertain economic
environment, slower market growth and overcapacity in several of our markets, which resulted in overall lower order and revenue levels. As a result of this uncertain economic environment, our total order volume declined in 2012 compared to 2011. The
degree of the impact of any downturn on our business depends on a number of factors, including: the strength of the global and United States economies; the overall level of demand for consumer electronics products; the stability of global financial
systems; and the overall health of the microelectronics, semiconductor, LEDs and consumer electronics industries.  Highly Competitive
Markets  We face substantial competition from established competitors throughout the world, some of which have greater
financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Those competitors with greater resources may, in addition to other things, be able to better withstand periodic downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and
technology, or more quickly develop enhancements to, and new generations of, products that compete with the products we manufacture and market. New companies may enter the markets in which we compete, or industry consolidation may occur, further
increasing competition in those markets. We believe that to be competitive we must continue to expend significant financial resources in order to, among other things, invest in new product development and enhancements. We may not be able to compete
successfully in the future and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share. 
Increased Price Pressure  We have experienced and continue to experience pricing pressure in the sale of our products, from both competitors and customers. Pricing pressures typically have become more intense during cyclical
downturns when competitors seek to maintain or increase market share, reduce inventory or introduce more technologically advanced products. In addition, we may agree to pricing concessions with our customers in connection with volume orders. Our
business, financial condition, margins or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by competitive pressure and intense price-based competition.

Revenues are Largely Dependent on Few Customers 
We depend on a few significant customers for a large portion of our revenues. In 2012, our top ten customers accounted for approximately
56% of total net sales, with one customer accounting for approximately 29% of total net sales. We anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues.
Consolidation between customers, changes in technologies or solutions used by customers, changes in products manufactured by customers or in end-user demand for those products, selection of suppliers other than us, customer bankruptcies or customer
departures from their respective industries all may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue. Furthermore, none of our customers have any long-term obligation to continue to buy our products or services and may
therefore delay, reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we
were to lose any of our significant customers or suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
Revenues are Largely Based on the Sale of a Small Number of Product Units 
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of products. Accordingly, our revenues, margins
and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors in addition to those described above, including:   


 

 
 changes in the timing of orders and terms or acceptance of product shipments by our customers; 
 


 

 
 changes in the mix of products and services that we sell; 
 


 

 
 timing and market acceptance of our new product introductions; and 
 


 

 
 delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers.
 As a result of these risks, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating
results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.  Risks Related to Our
Supply Chain and Production  Variability of Production Capacity 
To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During
periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our supply chain. Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in
response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products. Conversely, when upturns
occur in the markets we serve, we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our manufacturing capacity or procuring sufficient materials to meet sudden increases in customer demand that could result in the loss of business to our
competitors and harm to our relationships with our customers. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected.  Problems with Critical Suppliers  We use a wide range of components from numerous suppliers in the manufacture of our products, including custom electronic, laser, optical and mechanical components. We generally do not have guaranteed
supply 
  10 


Table of Contents

arrangements with our suppliers. We seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts,
monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, some key parts are available only from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term. In addition, some of the lasers we use in our products are difficult to manufacture, and as a result we may not receive an adequate supply of lasers in a timely fashion to fill orders.
Operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption or discontinuation for a variety of reasons, including changes in business relationships, competitive factors, financial difficulties, work stoppages, fire, natural disasters or
other causes. Any such disruption or discontinuation to our suppliers operations could interrupt or reduce our manufacturing activities and delay delivery of our products, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results
of operations. In addition, when markets recover from economic downturns, there is a heightened risk that one or more of our suppliers may not be able to meet increased demand requirements, adversely impacting our ability to fulfill orders and win
business with our customers.  Problems with Contract Manufacturers 
We have arrangements with contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing of certain of our products or product subcomponents. Any
significant interruption in our contract manufacturers ability to provide manufacturing services to us as a result of contractual disputes with us or another party, labor disruptions, financial difficulties, natural disasters, delay or
interruption in the receipt of inventory, customer prioritization or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed deliveries for certain of our products, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations.  Charges for Excess or Obsolete Inventory 
One factor on which we compete is the ability to ship products on schedules required by customers. In order to facilitate timely shipping,
management forecasts demand, both in type and amount of products, and these forecasts are used to determine inventory to be purchased. We also order materials based on our technology roadmap, which represents managements assessment of
technology that will be utilized in new products that we develop. Certain types of inventory, including lasers and optical equipment, are particularly expensive and may only be used in the production of a single type of product. If actual demand is
lower than forecast with respect to the type or amount of products actually ordered, or both, our inventory levels may increase. As a result, there is a risk that we may have to incur material accounting charges for excess and obsolete inventory if
inventory cannot be used, which would negatively affect our financial results. Also, if we alter our technology or product development strategy, we may have inventory that may not be usable under the new strategy, which may also result in material
accounting charges. For example, during 2012, we recorded $2.0 million of charges in cost of sales for an inventory write-off associated with discontinued products.  Risks Related to Our Organization  Operating a Global Business 
International shipments accounted for 92% of net sales in 2012, with 87% of our net shipments to customers in Asia. We expect that
international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future. We also have significant foreign operations, including manufacturing facilities in Singapore and China, research and development facilities in
Canada and Taiwan, and sales and service offices in various countries. Under our globalization strategy, we intend to increase our foreign operations in the future. Our non-U.S. sales, purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in
conducting business abroad, many of which are outside our control, including the following:   


 

 
 periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions; 
 


 

 
 price and currency exchange controls;   


 

 
 fluctuation in the relative values of currencies; 
  11 


Table of Contents


 

 
 difficulty in repatriating money, whether as a result of tax laws or otherwise; 
 


 

 
 difficulties protecting intellectual property;   


 

 
 compliance with labor laws and other laws governing employees; 
 


 

 
 local labor disputes;   


 

 
 shipping delays and disruptions;   


 

 
 unexpected changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; and 
 


 

 
 difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable, and managing suppliers, distributors and
representatives.  Our business and operating results could also be impacted, directly or indirectly, by
natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious disease, military action, international conflicts, terrorist activities, civil unrest and associated political instability. Many of our facilities, including our Portland, Oregon headquarters, are in areas
with known earthquake risk. Some of these events or circumstances may also result in heightened security concerns with respect to domestic and international travel and commerce, which may further affect our business and operating results. In
particular, due to these uncertainties, we are subject to the following additional risks:   


 

 
 future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non-U.S. engineers and other key technical employees in our U.S.
facilities or our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees in such facilities;   


 

 
 more frequent instances of shipping delays;   


 

 
 demand for our products may not increase or may decrease; and 
 


 

 
 our customers or suppliers may experience financial difficulties or cease operations. 
Implementation and Modification of Globalization Strategy  We are implementing our globalization strategy in which we are moving certain operational resources and capabilities to different countries in Asia to be closer to many of our significant customers and to
reduce costs. We believe this strategy will enhance customer relationships, improve our responsiveness, and reduce our manufacturing costs for certain products. We opened a manufacturing facility in Singapore in the fourth quarter of 2010, which
manufactures certain IMG, LED, CG and laser ablation products and is now our primary system manufacturing facility. Additionally, we have a manufacturing facility in Beijing China, which manufactures certain laser products. 
Our globalization strategy is subject to a variety of complexities and risks, many of which we have little experience managing, and which
may divert a substantial amount of managements time. These risks include:   


 

 
 challenges in designing new facilities that can be scaled for future expansion, replicating current processes and bringing new facilities up to full
operation;   


 

 
 unpredictable costs, redundancy costs and cost overruns for developing new facilities and acquiring equipment; 
 


 

 
 building local management teams, technical personnel and other staff for functions that we have not previously conducted outside of the United States;
  


 

 
 technical obstacles such as poor production or process yield and loss of quality control during the ramp of a new facility;
  


 

 
 re-qualifications and other procedures that may be required by our customers; 
 


 

 
 our ability to bring up local suppliers to meet our quality and cycle-time needs; 
 


 

 
 our ability to reduce costs in the United States as we add costs in Asia; 
  12 


Table of Contents


 

 
 rapidly changing business conditions that may require plans to be changed or abandoned before they are fully implemented; and
  


 

 
 challenges posed by distance and by differences in language and culture. 
These and other factors could delay the development and implementation of our strategy, as well as impair our gross margins, delay
shipments and deliveries, cause us to lose sales, require us to write off investments already made, damage our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we decide to change our current globalization
strategy, we may incur charges for certain costs incurred.  Acquisitions and Divestitures 
We may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, other businesses with complementary products, services or technologies, such
as our September 2010 acquisition of certain assets of PyroPhotonics Lasers, Inc. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including: 
 


 

 
 difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of the acquired businesses;
  


 

 
 implementation of our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system into the acquired companys operations; 
 


 

 
 diversion of managements attention from other operational matters; 
 


 

 
 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; 
 


 

 
 lack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition; 
 


 

 
 acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company;
  


 

 
 difficulties establishing satisfactory internal controls at the acquired company; 
 


 

 
 risks and uncertainties relating to the performance of the combined company following the transaction; and 
 


 

 
 acquiring unanticipated liabilities for which we will not be indemnified. 
Furthermore, the accounting for an acquisition could result in significant charges resulting from amortization or write-off of intangible
assets we acquire. Our inability to effectively manage these risks could result in our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition on a timely basis, or at all, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, all acquisition transaction costs must be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
The means by which we finance an acquisition may also significantly affect our business or the value of the shares of our common stock.
If we issue common stock to pay for an acquisition, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders will be diluted and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be reduced. If we use cash on hand to pay for an
acquisition, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes. If we borrow funds in connection with an acquisition, we would be required to use cash to service the debt and
to comply with financial and other covenants.  We may from time to time also make strategic investments in development stage
companies. Investments in development stage companies are subject to a high degree of risk. We could lose all or a portion of our investment in any such company.

Hiring and Retention of Personnel 
Our continued success depends in part upon the services of our key managerial, financial and technical personnel. The loss of key
personnel, or our inability to attract, assimilate and retain qualified personnel, could result in the loss of customers, inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results
of operations. We have previously had to, and may in the future have to, impose salary reductions on employees during economic downturns in an effort to maintain our financial position. These actions may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty
and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we compete is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We may
incur significant costs in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel, which could affect our financial position and results of operations.  Risks Related to Technology  Markets Characterized by Rapid Technological Change
 The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation, frequent new product
introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes and
the requirements of current and potential customers. The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well
as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. The introduction
by us or by our competitors of new or enhanced products, or alternative technologies, may cause our customers to defer, change or cancel orders for our existing products or cease purchasing our products altogether. For example, our semiconductor
memory customers are exploring alternative redundancy technologies such as electrical redundancy technology. If our customers were to achieve sufficient yield improvement with one of these technologies and convert it into their manufacturing
process, there could be a material adverse effect on the size of the addressable market of our memory yield improvement systems. In addition, we believe the semiconductor memory repair market is maturing, which could result in lower demand for our
memory repair products during up cycles than we have experienced historically. Further, we cannot assure that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors,
technology changes or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to develop new or enhanced products to address product or technology changes or new industry standards on a timely basis or at all, or if our new or enhanced products are not
accepted by the market, or if our customers adopt alternative technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  Need to Invest in Research and Development  Our industry is
characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development. Because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete, if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become
less attractive to our current and potential customers or obsolete, and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area, our operating results
could be materially harmed if our net sales decline. In addition, as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation, our operating costs may increase in the future, and research and development expenses may
increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales.  Products are Highly Complex 
Our products are highly complex, and our extensive product development, manufacturing and testing processes may not be adequate to detect
all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer 
  14 


Table of Contents

satisfaction or result in claims against us. As a result, we may have to replace certain components or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products after they are
shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers and other losses to us or to our customers. These
occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, loss of sales and increased expenses and warranty costs, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 
Risks Related to Legal Matters 
Protection of Proprietary Rights  Generally  Our success depends significantly upon the protection of our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our proprietary rights through patents, copyrights, trademarks, maintenance of trade secrets and
other measures, including entering into confidentiality agreements. We incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and to defend our intellectual property rights. For example, we initiated litigation against All Ring Tech Co., Ltd. in
Taiwan in August 2005 alleging that certain of our patent rights had been violated. We rely upon the laws of the United States and foreign countries where we develop, manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights. We may not be
successful in protecting these proprietary rights, these rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect, or other parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent these rights. 
Protection of Proprietary Rights  Foreign Jurisdictions  Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States. Many United States
companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could be easier for our competitors
to sell competing products in foreign countries, which could result in reduced sales and gross margins.  Intellectual Property
Infringement Claims  Several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies, applications and
methods of use similar to some of those used in our products. While we attempt in our designs to avoid patent infringement, from time to time we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products,
as used by our customers, may be infringing one or more of these patents. Competitors or others have in the past and may in the future assert infringement claims against our customers or us with respect to current or future products or uses, and
these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others. If claims of infringement are asserted against our customers, those customers may seek indemnification from us for
damages or expenses they incur.  If we become subject to infringement claims, we will evaluate our position and consider the
available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position. These licenses, however, may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are not able to negotiate the necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Tax Audits and Changes in Tax Law  We are periodically under audit
by United States and foreign tax authorities and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates
are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and the impact of changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws could result in material differences from what is reflected in historical income tax accruals. If additional taxes are assessed
as a result of an examination, a material effect on our financial results, tax positions or cash flows could occur in the period or periods in which the determination is made. 
  15 


Table of Contents
Legal Proceedings  From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings, including breach of contract claims and claims that involve possible infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of third
parties. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation matters, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of managements attention,
which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse determinations in such litigation could result in loss of our property rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require
us to seek licenses from others or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Provisions Restricting Our Acquisition  Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has also adopted
a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer. In addition, the Oregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination Act limit the ability of parties who acquire a
significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of our Board of
Directors, may deter efforts to obtain control of us and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our shareholders. 
Risks Related to Financial Matters 
Unfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations  Currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter.
Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to those customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable
currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our foreign sales are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency we receive in
payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of accounts receivable primarily denominated in Japanese
yen and other currencies. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could adversely affect
our results of operations.  Fluctuations in Effective Tax Rate 
As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject
to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year are a function of many factors, including: (a) taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits (losses) earned by ESI and our subsidiaries in
numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates; (b) our ability to utilize deferred tax assets; (c) taxes, refunds, interest or penalties resulting from tax audits; (d) the magnitude of various credits and
deductions as a percentage of total taxable income; and (e) changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Impairment of Intangible Assets 
We held a total of $8.3 million in acquired intangible assets and $4.0 million in goodwill at March 31, 2012. We review our
acquired intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment using a qualitative and quantitative approach at least annually or between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value.  We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2012 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit was
less than its carrying value. Based on current economic conditions combined with our stock price, which has remained below carrying value per share since mid-May 2012, we anticipate performing a goodwill impairment test during the first quarter
of 2013. If at any time management determines that an impairment exists, we will be required to reflect the impaired value as part of operating income, which will result in a reduction in earnings and a corresponding reduction in our net asset
value in the period such impairment is identified.  Stock Price Volatility 
The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. During fiscal 2012, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $19.88 per
share and a low of $11.10 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors
affecting our stock price, many of which are outside of our control, may include:   


 

 
 variations in operating results from quarter to quarter; 
 


 

 
 changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations; 
 


 

 
 changes in the market price per share of our public company customers; 
 


 

 
 market conditions in the semiconductor and other industries into which we sell products; 
 


 

 
 general economic conditions;   


 

 
 political changes, hostilities or natural disasters;   


 

 
 low trading volume of our common stock;   


 

 
 the number of analysts covering our common stock; and 
 


 

 
 the number of firms making a market in our common stock.  In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high-technology
companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Reduction or Cessation of
Dividends  Our Board of Directors first adopted a dividend policy in December 2011. We intend to pay quarterly
dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and
payment of cash dividends. Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions; funding of research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs;
changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any
particular amounts. A reduction or cessation in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.

Impairment of Investments 
Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of commercial paper, debt securities issued by U.S. governmental agencies and municipal
debt securities. These investments are intended to be highly liquid and low risk. If the markets for these securities were to deteriorate for any reason, including as a result of a downgrade in the credit rating of U.S. government securities, the
liquidity and value of these investments could be negatively affected, which could result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Properties  Our
executive and administrative headquarters, which houses our primary engineering and marketing functions as well as some of our Semiconductor Group (SG) manufacturing facilities, are located in a four-building complex with 250,800 square feet of
space on 15 acres in Portland, Oregon. Additionally, our Components Group (CG) consumable products are manufactured at a 53,000 square foot plant on 31 acres in Klamath Falls, Oregon. We own all of these buildings. We believe the productive capacity
of these facilities to be adequate and suitable for the requirements of our business for the foreseeable future.  Our primary
system manufacturing facilities are located in leased facilities in Singapore. We lease approximately 26,000 square feet of facilities in Singapore where we manufacture certain Interconnect & Microfabrication Group (IMG), LED, CG and laser
ablation products. We also lease approximately 65,000 square feet of facilities in Fremont, California that are used primarily for engineering and marketing of our LED products and as a demonstration center for our microfabrication systems. We
additionally lease approximately 20,150 square feet of facilities in Beijing, China, where we manufacture certain laser products. Additionally, we lease other office and facility space in various locations throughout the United States and various
foreign countries.   


Item 3.
Legal Proceedings  All Ring
Patent Infringement Prosecution  In August 2005, we commenced a proceeding in the Kaohsiung District Court of Taiwan (the
Court) directed against All Ring Tech Co., Ltd. (All Ring) of Taiwan. We alleged that All Rings Capacitor Tester Model RK-T6600 (the Capacitor Tester) infringes ESIs Taiwan Patent No. 207469, entitled Circuit Component
Handler (the 207469 patent). As part of this proceeding, the Court issued a Provisional Attachment Order (PAO) in August 2005, restricting the use of some of All Rings assets. All Ring then filed a bond with the Court to obtain relief
from the attachment of its assets. In July 2007, the Court issued a second PAO and approximately $6.0 million was restricted in All Rings accounts. The second PAO remains in effect and cannot be revoked. 
In October 2005, we filed a formal patent infringement action against All Ring in the Court. Also in October 2005, the Court executed a
Preliminary Injunction Order (PIO) that prohibits All Ring from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale or using the Capacitor Tester until final judgment is entered in the formal patent infringement action. The Court dismissed All Rings
application to revoke the PIO on January 18, 2008, and the PIO remains in place.  On June 3, 2011 the Court orally
announced its judgment, finding that the Capacitor Tester, as well as All Rings RK-T2000 and RK-L50 systems, had infringed the 207469 patent, ordering All Ring to pay ESI approximately $24 million in damages, plus interest accrued from
November 4, 2005 through the payment date at a rate of 5%, and enjoining All Ring from selling the infringing systems. The written judgment was issued on

June 13, 2011. On June 16, 2011, All Ring posted a cash bond for approximately $24.0 million to prevent the provisional execution of the judgment. All Ring appealed this judgment to the
Intellectual Property Court on June 28, 2011 and on October 31, 2011, we filed our response to All Rings appeal. We and All Ring have each filed additional briefs with the Intellectual Property Court. The Intellectual Property Court
is expected to hold its final hearing in this matter in October 2012.  As a part of these proceedings, we established three
letters of credit for approximately $19.5 million in July 2009, September 2009 and June 2011, which are collateralized by $22.3 million of restricted cash. The total restricted cash balance of $22.3 million was included in Restricted cash on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2012 as a current asset.  In the ordinary course of business, we are
involved in various other legal matters, either asserted or unasserted, and investigations. In the opinion of management, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

 Share Repurchase Program  On May 15, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of our outstanding common stock primarily to offset dilution from equity
compensation programs. The repurchases are to be made at managements discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market
conditions, share price and other factors. There was no fixed completion date for the repurchase program.  We did not
repurchase any shares under this program during 2012. As of March 31, 2012, a total of 372,825 shares had been repurchased for $5.3 million under this authorization at an average price of $14.16 per share, calculated inclusive of commissions
and fees. Any cash used to settle repurchase transactions is reflected as a component of cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  On December 9, 2011, the Board of Directors terminated the prior repurchase program and authorized a new share repurchase program totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of our outstanding common
stock. The repurchases are to be made at managements discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions, share
price and other factors. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2012. There is no fixed completion date for the repurchase program.  Disclosures related to securities authorized for issuance under our Equity Compensation Plans are incorporated by reference into Item 12 of this annual report on Form 10-K, Security Ownership of
Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters, from our Proxy Statement for our fiscal 2012 annual meeting.

Dividends  On December 9, 2011, the Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. Accordingly, we declared a dividend of $0.08 per outstanding common share
to shareholders of record on January 27, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid the dividend for a total amount of $2.3 million. There were no dividends declared or paid during 2011. 
Subsequent to the year ended March 31, 2012, the Board of Directors declared an $0.08 per outstanding common share cash dividend on
May 10, 2012, payable June 18, 2012 to shareholders of record on June 4, 2012. The estimated amount to be paid as a result of the May 10, 2012 declaration is $2.3 million. 
ESI currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration,
timing and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on ESIs financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a
determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of ESIs shareholders.

Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Overview of Business 
Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ESI) is a leading supplier of innovative laser-based manufacturing solutions for
the microtechnology industry. Our advanced laser systems enable precise structuring of micron to submicron features in components and devices which are used in a wide variety of end products in the consumer electronics, computer, communications and
other industries. These features enable our customers to achieve functionality, or improve yield and productivity in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability. Founded in 1944, ESI is headquartered in Portland,
Oregon, with global operations and subsidiaries in Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States.  Our advanced laser
microfabrication systems allow microelectronics, semiconductor, and other microtechnology manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high-volume production in order to increase performance and improve production yields. Laser
microfabrication comprises a set of precise micron-level processes, including via drilling, wafer scribing and dicing, material ablation, semiconductor memory-link cutting, electronic device trimming, and nano-level structuring to alter material
characteristics such as color and texture. These processes require application-specific laser systems able to meet our customers exacting performance and productivity requirements. Our laser-based systems improve production yields or enable
improved performance for flexible interconnect material, semiconductor devices, light emitting diodes (LEDs), high-density interconnect (HDI) circuits, advanced semiconductor packaging, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and other high value
components.  Additionally, we produce high-capacity test and inspection equipment that is critical to the quality control
process during the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). Our equipment ensures that each component meets the electrical and physical tolerances required to perform properly. We also produce products building on this technology that
are used to test the electrical and optical characteristics, including color and intensity, of packaged LEDs.  Overview of Financial
Results  Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Accordingly, our fiscal
2012 reporting period consisted of a 52-week period ending on March 31, 2012, our fiscal 2011 reporting period consisted of a 52-week period ending on April 2, 2011 and our fiscal 2010 reporting period consisted of a 53-week period ending
on April 3, 2010. All references to years or quarters relate to fiscal years or fiscal quarters unless otherwise noted. 
In the first half of 2012, the combination of relatively healthy markets, strong sales of new products and delivery on 2011 backlog drove
excellent revenue growth. In the second half of 2012, we experienced the negative impact of an uncertain economic environment, slower market growth and overcapacity in several of our markets, which resulted in overall lower order and revenue levels.
Despite the impact of this trend, our flex interconnect business experienced healthy growth over the prior year. Our total order volume in 2012 was $255.5 million, down approximately 10%, compared to orders of $284.6 million in 2011. 
Orders for our Interconnect & Microfabrication (IMG) products increased by approximately 20% in 2012 compared to 2011. The
increase was due to continued growth in our flex interconnect businesses driven by strong demand from our flex circuit customers for our industry leading 5330xi model via drilling system. The demand was primarily a result of increasing use of
flexible circuitry and market growth of mobile electronics particularly smart phones and tablet devices. Orders for our microfabrication products were driven by follow on demand from existing applications and the introduction of our new model 5950
low cost platform. However, the lumpy nature of microfabrication design wins negatively impacted revenue levels for IMG in the second half of 2012.  Orders for our Semiconductor Group (SG) products decreased approximately 45% in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was driven by lower demand for our memory repair systems and LED scribing systems as a
primarily as a result of slower growth and overcapacity in the DRAM and LED markets in the second half of the year. 
  24 


Table of Contents
Orders for our Components Group (CG) products decreased approximately 45% in 2012 compared
to 2011. Our MLCC customers continued utilizing their existing capacity as growth in MLCC consumption reflected only modest demand for consumer electronics.  Total shipments were $251.5 million in 2012 compared to $259.6 million in 2011. By product group, IMG shipments increased by approximately 35%, SG shipments decreased by approximately 30% in 2012 and CG
shipments decreased by approximately 50%, all consistent with the trends in their respective order levels. Backlog was $69.1 million as of March 31, 2012 compared to $65.5 million as of April 2, 2011. 
Net sales were $254.2 million in 2012 compared to $256.8 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales in SG and CG
driven by lower demand for DRAM and by MLCC customers continued utilization of existing capacity, partially offset by the increase in IMG sales as a result of higher demand for our flex-circuit via drilling and shipments of our advanced
microfabrication systems.  Gross profit was $107.7 million in 2012 compared to $108.9 million in 2011. This decrease was
primarily due to $2.0 million of charges in cost of sales for an inventory write-off associated with discontinued products in the fourth quarter. Gross margins were 42.4% on net sales of $254.2 million in 2012 compared to 42.4% on net sales of
$256.8 million in 2011. While overall gross margins remained flat year over year on similar volumes, excluding the inventory write-off, they improved slightly on favorable product mix. 
Net operating expenses of $106.5 million in 2012 increased $5.0 million from $101.5 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to a
$3.0 million increase in restructuring costs, a $2.1 million increase in share-based compensation expense and a $1.2 million increase in loss on disposal of assets and the write-off of engineering materials. These increases were partially offset by
savings achieved from cost control measures and the reduction in net legal settlements from the prior year. The increases in restructuring costs and the loss on disposal of assets were a result of implementing our ongoing globalization strategy and
other cost control measures. The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to accelerated expense associated with the Chief Executive Officers retirement eligibility date and increased attainment of performance-based
grants.  Operating income was $1.2 million in 2012 compared to $7.4 million in 2011, a decrease of $6.2 million. This decrease
was primarily due to higher operating expenses and the charge for an inventory write-off discussed above. Non-operating income was $2.3 million in 2012 compared to $0.9 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in
gain on sale of previously impaired auction rate securities (ARS), compared to 2011. Net income was $4.9 million in 2012 compared to net income of $7.9 million in 2011.

 Net sales for 2012 decreased $2.6 million or 1% from net sales for 2011. Sales in IMG increased by 34%
while SG and CG decreased by 25% and 47%, respectively.  IMG sales for 2012 increased $42.6 million compared to 2011. The
increase in IMG sales was driven by higher sales of our flex-circuit via drilling and advanced microfabrication systems. Demand from the flex-circuit and integrated circuit packaging segments of the market has continued to strengthen as a result of
growth in portable consumer electronics such as smart phones and tablet computers. Additionally, increased shipments for our advanced microfabrication products were driven by follow-on orders to expand capacity for existing applications. 
SG sales for 2012 decreased $20.0 million compared to 2011. The decrease in SG revenues was primarily driven by lower sales of our memory
repair systems as a result of slower demand for DRAM and related overcapacity in the DRAM market.

 Gross profit was $107.7 million for 2012, a decrease of $1.3 million or 1% compared to 2011. Gross profit
decreased primarily due to $2.0 million of charges in cost of sales for an inventory write-off associated with discontinued products in the fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.4% for 2012 and 2011. While overall gross
margins remained flat year over year on similar volumes, excluding the inventory write-off, they improved slightly on favorable product mix.

 Selling, Service and Administration  Selling, service and administration (SS&A) expenses primarily consist of labor and other employee-related expenses including share-based compensation expense, travel expenses, professional fees, sales
commissions and facilities costs.  SS&A expenses for 2012 increased $0.3 million compared to 2011. This increase was
primarily attributable to a $1.6 million increase in share-based compensation expense, which was driven by accelerated expense associated with the Chief Executive Officers retirement eligibility date and increased attainment of
performance-based grants. This increase was largely offset by lower compensation expense.  Research, Development and Engineering
 Research, development and engineering (RD&E) expenses are primarily comprised of labor and other employee-related
expenses, professional fees, project materials costs, equipment costs and facilities costs. RD&E expenses for 2012 increased $1.5 million compared to 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher project materials costs and increased
professional fees associated with patent activity.

Table of Contents
Share-Based Compensation  The table of operating expenses shown above includes $10.4 million and $8.2 million of share-based compensation expense for 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expense
was primarily driven by accelerated expense associated with the Chief Executive Officers retirement eligibility date and increased attainment of performance-based grants.  Restructuring Costs  As part of our globalization strategy, during 2011, we
initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide cost structure through transition of certain procurement and manufacturing activities to Asia. In 2012, we continued our globalization efforts and we additionally identified and initiated other
cost reduction actions. As a result of these actions, we recognized $3.8 million of restructuring costs in 2012. The estimated completion date for these actions is September 30, 2012. 
The restructuring costs of $3.8 million incurred in 2012 were comprised primarily of $1.9 million of employee severance and related
benefits and $1.7 million of accelerated depreciation for certain assets. We shortened the depreciable lives of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 largely as a result of consolidating facilities in the United States and Asia. Restructuring
costs were $0.8 million in 2011 primarily due to employee severance and related benefits.  Loss on Disposal of Assets 
As a part of our on-going globalization strategy and cost reduction actions discussed above, in 2012, we recognized a loss of $1.0 million
resulting from disposal of certain fixed assets primarily used in testing and development.  Legal Settlement Costs 
In 2009, James Dooley, our former Chief Executive Officer, initiated arbitration against us seeking severance in connection with his 2003
termination for cause. On December 10, 2010, the assigned arbitrator ruled in favor of Mr. Dooley and, as a result, we recognized approximately $1.4 million in legal settlement costs in 2011. On December 27, 2010, we filed a
complaint seeking declaratory relief to vacate the arbitration award with the United States District Court, District of Oregon. On May 17, 2011, the court ruled in favor of Mr. Dooley. On May 19, 2011, we filed a motion for the court
to admit into evidence certain testimony of Mr. Dooley, arguing that the court was in error in not admitting it in the proceeding, and asking the court to reconsider its ruling based on that evidence. On June 14, 2011, the court ruled in
favor of admitting the testimony into evidence, but also reaffirmed its original ruling upholding the arbitrators award. We did not further appeal and paid the award in the first quarter of 2012. As a result, we recognized an additional $0.6
million in legal settlement costs in 2012.  Non-operating Income and Expense 
Gain on sale of Previously Impaired Auction Rate Securities (ARS)  During the first quarter of 2012, we sold all of our remaining ARS with a total par value of $14.7 million for approximately $6.5 million. We recorded a total gain of $2.7 million, which included $1.4
million in reclassification of previously recorded unrealized gains out of accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 5 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for further discussion.

 Net interest and other expense was $0.4 million in 2012 compared to net interest and other income of $0.2
million in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest yields on our investments and market losses on assets held for our deferred compensation plan. We sold our remaining ARS in the fourth quarter of 2011 and early in the first
quarter of 2012, which were earning above market interest rates.  Income Taxes

 The income tax benefit for 2012 was $1.4 million on pretax income of $3.5 million, an effective rate of
40.6%. For 2011, the income tax provision was $0.4 million on pretax income of $8.3 million, an effective rate of 4.7%. In 2012, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the increased tax advantages from growth in our Singapore manufacturing
operations as well as higher tax credits.  Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation based upon the mix of income and
relative tax rates between jurisdictions, and the occurrence and timing of numerous discrete events such as changes in tax laws or their interpretations, extensions or expirations of research and experimentation credits, closure of tax years subject
to examination, finalization of income tax returns, the relationship of fixed deductions to overall changes in estimated and actual pretax income or loss and the tax jurisdictions where income or loss is generated. Based on currently available
information, we are not aware of any further discrete events which are likely to occur that would have a material effect on our financial position, expected cash flows or results of operations.

 Net sales for 2011 increased $107.9 million or 72% over net sales for 2010. Sales increased in all three
business groups, with significant dollar increases in SG and IMG.  IMG sales for 2011 increased $35.2 million or 40% compared
to 2010. The increase in IMG sales was driven by higher sales of our flex-circuit via drilling and advanced microfabrication systems. Demand from the flex-circuit and integrated circuit packaging segments of the market continued to strengthen as a
result of consumer demand for portable electronics. Additionally, demand continued to increase for advanced microfabrication products with the development of new applications as well as follow-on orders to expand capacity for existing applications.
 SG sales for 2011 increased $50.2 million or 176% compared to 2010. The increase in SG revenues was primarily driven by
recovery in the DRAM market and expansion of LED manufacturing in Asia. Strong prices for DRAM combined with increasing demand for Mobile DRAM for portable electronics drove additional demand for our memory repair systems. Additionally, with the
release of our proprietary tailored pulse laser technology, we were able to increase our market share in laser-based memory repair.  CG sales for 2011 were up $22.5 million or 71% compared to 2010. This increase was due to deliveries of MLCC test systems and consumable parts on higher orders that began in the second half of 2010.
Utilization levels of existing capacity remained high as our customers satisfy the increasing demand for MLCCs in consumer electronics.  The following table presents net sales information by geographic region:

Gross profit was $108.9 million for 2011, an increase of $53.1 million or 95% compared to
2010. Gross profit increased largely due to the higher sales discussed above, combined with the favorable impact of higher production utilizing the same fixed costs.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.4% for 2011 compared to 37.5% for 2010. This improvement was largely due to leveraging of higher production volume relative to fixed costs, and also
improvements in product mix during the year.  Operating Expenses

 Selling, Service and Administration  Selling, service and administration (SS&A) expenses primarily consist of labor and other employee-related expenses including share-based compensation expense, travel expenses, professional fees, sales
commissions and facilities costs. SS&A expenses for 2011 increased $9.7 million compared to 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to overall increases in business activity and improved operating results driven by sustained macroeconomic
and electronics industry recoveries, which resulted in increased headcount and higher compensation costs. Other factors included an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.4 million driven by incremental charges from our annual stock
grant and an acquisition cost of $0.3 million resulting from a business acquisition in 2011. In addition, we initiated several temporary cost reduction measures in 2009 and 2010, including salary reductions, which were restored in late 2010. These
increases in expenses were partially offset by acquisition settlement proceeds of $0.9 million received and lower purchase accounting expense in 2011.  Research, Development and Engineering  Research, development and
engineering (RD&E) expenses are primarily comprised of labor and other employee-related expenses, professional fees, project materials costs, equipment costs and facilities costs. RD&E expenses for 2011 increased $7.5 million compared to
2010. This increase was primarily due to increased project expenses, headcount and compensation expenses, including the restoration of higher levels of pay.  Share-Based Compensation  The table of operating expenses shown above
includes $8.2 million and $6.7 million of share-based compensation expense for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Share-based compensation expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the incremental charges from the annual stock grant in
2011.  Legal Settlement Costs  In 2009, James Dooley, former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, initiated arbitration against us seeking severance in connection with his 2003 termination for cause. On December 10, 2010, the
assigned arbitrator ruled in favor of Mr. Dooley and, as a result, we recognized approximately $1.4 million in legal settlement costs in 2011. On December 27, 2010, we filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief to vacate the

arbitration award with the United States District Court, District of Oregon. On May 17, 2011, the court ruled in favor of Mr. Dooley. On May 19, 2011, we filed a motion for the
court to admit into evidence certain testimony of Mr. Dooley, arguing that the court was in error in not admitting it in the proceeding, and asking the court to reconsider its ruling based on that evidence. On June 14, 2011, the court
ruled in favor of admitting the testimony into evidence, but also reaffirmed its original ruling upholding the arbitrators award. 
Restructuring Costs  As
part of our globalization strategy, during 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide cost structure through transition of certain procurement and manufacturing activities to Asia. As a result of these actions, we recognized
$0.8 million of restructuring costs in 2011.  Merger Termination Proceeds, net 
No merger termination proceeds or merger transaction costs were received or incurred in 2011. Net merger termination proceeds for 2010
were $4.5 million, which represented the receipt of a $5.4 million merger termination fee partially offset by $0.9 million of merger transaction costs.  Non-operating Income and Expense  Gain on Sale of Previously Impaired Auction
Rate Securities (ARS)  In 2011, we sold a certain ARS with a par value of $3.0 million for approximately $0.7 million, and
recorded a gain of $0.7 million as the security was previously written down to zero value. See Note 5 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further
discussion on the ARS.  Other-than-temporary Impairment of Auction Rate Securities (ARS) 
There was no other-than-temporary impairment charge of ARS in 2011. In 2010, other-than-temporary impairment charges related to our ARS
were $1.3 million. This charge was recorded during the fourth quarter due to the suspension of interest payments by the issuer of certain of our ARS and decreases in the credit quality of bond insurers of certain of our other ARS. See Note 5
Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Interest and Other Income, net  Interest and other income, net, consists of interest income and expense, market gains and losses on assets held in employees deferred compensation accounts, realized and unrealized foreign exchange
gains and losses, bank charges, investment management fees, ARS valuation fees and other miscellaneous non-operating items. Net interest and other income was as follows:

 In 2011, net interest and other income was $0.2 million compared to $1.4 million in 2010. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the lower interest income due to market-driven decreases in yields, foreign currency losses due to appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, higher hedging costs of the Korean Won and increased bank fees due to higher banking
activity in 2011.

 As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for 2011 was $7.9 million, or $0.28 per basic and
diluted share, compared to net loss of $12.0 million, or $0.44 per basic share for 2010.  Financial Condition and Liquidity 
At March 31, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $69.8 million, short-term investments of
$106.7 million and accounts receivable of $32.7 million. We also held $22.3 million in restricted cash which represented collateral for commercial letters of credit related to our ongoing legal proceedings against All Ring Tech Co., Ltd. At
March 31, 2012, we had a current ratio of 6.93 and held no long-term debt. Working capital of $269.5 million increased $9.8 million compared to April 2, 2011 balance of $259.7 million. We also held approximately $23.0 million of
non-current investments at March 31, 2012.  In December 2011, the Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy under
which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. Accordingly, a dividend of $0.08 per outstanding common share was paid on February 17, 2012 to shareholders of record on January 27, 2012. The dividend amount paid as a result of the
December 9, 2011 declaration was $2.3 million. Subsequent to the year ended March 31, 2012, the Board of Directors declared an $0.08 per outstanding common share cash dividend on May 10, 2012, payable June 18, 2012 to
shareholders of record on June 4, 2012. The estimated amount to be paid as a result of the May 10, 2012 declaration is $2.3 million.  We currently anticipate that we will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration, timing and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of
the Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders.
 In May 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of our
outstanding common stock primarily to offset dilution from equity compensation programs. Repurchases under the program were made at managements discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable
securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. We did not repurchase any shares under this program during 2012 or 2011. As of March 31, 2012, a total of 372,825 shares had been
repurchased under this authorization for $5.3 million at an average price of $14.16 per share, calculated inclusive of commissions and fees. There was no fixed completion date for the repurchase program.

Table of Contents
In December 2011, the Board of Directors terminated the above 2008 repurchase program and
authorized a new share repurchase program totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of our outstanding common stock. The repurchases are to be made at managements discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in
compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2012. There is no fixed completion date for the
repurchase program.  As of March 31, 2012, we did not hold any ARS investments. During the first quarter of 2012, we sold
all of the remaining ARS for approximately $6.0 million and all of the preferred stock for approximately $0.5 million. These ARS had a total estimated fair value of $5.2 million as of April 2, 2011, which consisted of $10.7 million par value
ARS and $4.0 million par value ARS which were converted by the bond issuer to its preferred stock in 2009. We recorded a gain of $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, which included $1.4 million in reclassification of previously recorded
unrealized gain out of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Sources and Uses of Cash 
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.3 million for 2012 due to $23.2 million from net income and non-cash items partially
offset by $8.9 million from net changes within working capital. Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities within working capital. In 2012, the primary sources of
cash outflow from working capital consisted of $16.9 million decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $5.3 million decreases in deferred revenue and $4.4 million increases in inventories, partially offset by $11.2 million decreases in
trade receivables, $3.9 million decreases in shipped systems pending acceptance and $2.6 million from decreases in other current assets.  In 2012, net cash used in investing activities of $62.5 million primarily resulted from $929.2 million of purchases of investments, and $4.9 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment,
partially offset by $883.3 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments including the sale of ARS. Additionally, restricted cash increased by $11.5 million in 2012 because of our ongoing legal proceedings against All Ring Tech Co.,
Ltd.  In 2012, net cash provided by financing activities of $1.2 million primarily resulted from $3.0 million of proceeds from
stock plan activity partially offset by $2.3 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders.  We believe that our existing
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are adequate to fund our operations, any dividends which may be declared, our share repurchase program and contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. 
Contractual Obligations 
The contractual commitments and obligations below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and
commitments. The actual payments may differ from these estimates due to changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, and other factors. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing of the payment schedule and the amounts of payments.
 The following table summarizes our contractual commitments and obligations as of March 31, 2012, by the fiscal year in
which they are due:

This table does not include $8.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the
uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows as of March 31, 2012. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities and the total amounts of income tax
payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend on the resolution of current and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on
historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
Our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following: 
 


 

 
 revenue recognition;   


 

 
 inventory valuation;   


 

 
 product warranty reserves;   


 

 
 allowance for doubtful accounts;   


 

 
 accrued restructuring costs;   


 

 
 share-based compensation;   


 

 
 income taxes including the valuation of deferred tax assets; 
 


 

 
 fair value measurements;   


 

 
 valuation of cost method equity investments;   


 

 
 valuation of long-lived assets; and   


 

 
 valuation of goodwill. 
Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related
receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier. Revenue is recognized upon such delivery, provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be
demonstrated prior to shipment. Where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of substantially new products, revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, the fair
values of any undelivered elements are deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met. Revenues are recorded net of taxes collected which are required to be submitted to government authorities. Installation services are
not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment and installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete. Historically, neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred
has been material.  Revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in Japan are recognized upon title
transfer, which generally occurs upon customer acceptance. Revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are generally recognized upon shipment. Revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of
the contracts.

Table of Contents
Inventory Valuation  We regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including, but not limited to, the following: forecasted sales or usage, historical usage rates, estimated service
period, product end-of-life dates, estimated current and future market values, service inventory requirements and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to
mitigate inventory exposure. Raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel. Raw material obsolescence write-downs are typically caused by engineering
change orders or product end-of-life adjustments in the market.  Research and development product costs are generally expensed
as incurred. Engineering materials that are expected to provide future value are generally classified as raw materials inventory.  Finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices. When necessary, we record inventory write-downs as
an increase to cost of sales based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities on hand and forecasted demand into our analysis. Additionally, from time to time, we may make strategic decisions to exit or alter product lines which
may result in an inventory write-down. If circumstances related to our inventories change, our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change.  Product Warranty Reserves  We evaluate obligations related to
product warranties quarterly. A standard one-year warranty is provided on most products. Warranty charges are comprised of costs to service the warranty, including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items, as well as
other costs incidental to the repairs. Warranty charges are recorded net of any cost recoveries resulting from either successful repair of damaged parts or from warranties offered by our suppliers for defective components. Using historical data, we
estimate average warranty cost per system or part type and record the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold upon recognition of the related revenue. Additionally, the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed
using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty, and any resulting changes in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. If circumstances change, or if a significant change in warranty-related
incidents occurs, the impact of the change in the warranty accrual could be material. Accrued product warranty is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accrued liabilities. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to establish
and modify their credit limits. On certain foreign sales, we require letters of credit. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customers account becomes past due, we
talk with the customer to determine the cause. If we determine that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business, we record a
specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information then available. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could
materially change. We record estimated bad debt expense as an increase to selling, service and administration expenses.  Accrued
Restructuring Costs  We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require us to make
estimates in certain areas including expenses for severance and other employee separation costs. Because we have a history of paying severance benefits, expenses and liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when
probable and estimable. For further discussion on the restructuring activities and related charges in 2012, 
  36 


Table of Contents

refer to our discussion of Restructuring Costs in the Results of Operations section above and Note 24 Restructuring and Cost Management Plans to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Share-Based Compensation
 We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted to our employees and
directors, including employee stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), non-vested restricted stock units and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We
use the Black-Scholes valuation model as our method of valuation for stock option and SAR awards.  The use of the
Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option and SAR awards requires us to make assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of
the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates based on our historical data, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the recognition of expense
could be materially different in the future.  Compensation expense is only recognized on awards that are estimated to
ultimately vest. Therefore, based on historical forfeiture rates and patterns, the estimated future forfeitures are factored into the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period. We update our forfeiture estimates at least annually
and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted. 
Income Taxes  We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We report a liability for
unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to the unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. When management determines that it is more likely than not
that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Should managements assumptions and expectations be inaccurate, our financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in future periods.  Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures (ASC Topic 820). When determining fair value on the financial assets and liabilities, we consider the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 
Valuation of Cost Method Equity Investments  As of March 31, 2012, minority equity investments included $6.0 million invested in Series D Preferred Stock and $3.0 million invested in Series E Preferred Stock of OmniGuide, Inc., representing an
11% interest. At each reporting period, we determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that are likely to have a 
  37 


Table of Contents

significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments. If there are no events or circumstances identified that would adversely affect the fair value of the investments, the fair
values of the investments are not calculated as it is not practicable to do so. As of March 31, 2012, we had not identified any events or circumstances that indicated the investments were impaired; therefore, the full carrying value of $9.0
million was included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, principally property and equipment and identifiable intangibles held and used by us, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash
flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There were no events or
circumstances during 2012 that would indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable.  Valuation of Goodwill
 We account for goodwill pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 as amended in September 2011 by
Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2011-08, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASC ASU 2011-08). ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually. ASC ASU 2011-08
permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment
using a qualitative and quantitative approach at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill was tested for impairment in
the fourth quarter of 2012 and it was determined that there was no impairment as of March 31, 2012.   


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity to meet operating needs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain an investment portfolio of cash, cash
equivalents, and investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency notes. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Our investment securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. The majority of these
securities are classified as available-for-sale securities; therefore, the impact on fair value of interest rate changes is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity. Due to the short duration of our investment portfolio, an
immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our invested assets.  Investment Risk
 Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities measured at fair value. The market value of
our investments is influenced by market risks, liquidity risk and the credit worthiness of underlying issuers of our investment. We strive to minimize the investment risk by investing in high quality securities and by utilizing experienced and high
credit quality financial institutions to manage the investment portfolio.  As of March 31, 2012, we did not hold any
auction rate securities (ARS) investments. During the first quarter of 2012, we sold all of our remaining ARS with a total par value of $14.7 million for approximately $6.5 
  38 


Table of Contents

million and recorded a total gain of $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 including $1.4 million in reclassification of previously recorded unrealized net gains out of accumulated other
comprehensive income.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
We purchase derivative financial instruments on a limited basis and do not use them for trading purposes. We do, however, use derivatives
to manage well-defined foreign currency risks. We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of material non-functional currency monetary asset and liability balances. The net effect of an immediate 10% change in exchange rates on the
forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged positions would not be material to our financial position or the results of our operations.  The table below summarizes, by currency, the notional amounts of our forward exchange contracts in U.S. dollars as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011. The bought amounts represent
the net U.S. dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the sold amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalents of commitments to sell foreign currencies. The foreign currency amounts have been translated
into a U.S. dollar equivalent value using the exchange rates at the reporting date.

Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board
of Directors and Shareholders  Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2012, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated June 12, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.  /s/ KPMG LLP  Portland,

ELECTRO SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. The Company 
Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) is a
leading supplier of innovative laser-based manufacturing solutions for the microtechnology industry. The Companys advanced laser systems enable precise structuring of micron to submicron features in components and devices which are used in a
wide variety of end products in the consumer electronics, computer, communications and other industries. These features enable the Companys customers to achieve functionality, or improve yield and productivity in their manufacturing processes
that can be critical to their profitability. Founded in 1944, the Company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, with global operations and subsidiaries in Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current periods presentation, with no effect on previously reported earnings or cash flows. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Companys fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Accordingly, the fiscal 2012 reporting period consisted of a 52-week period ending on March 31,
2012, the fiscal 2011 reporting period consisted of a 52-week period ending on April 2, 2011 and the fiscal 2010 reporting period consisted of a 53-week period ending on April 3, 2010. All references to years or quarters relate to fiscal
years or fiscal quarters unless otherwise noted.  Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  Management believes that the estimates
used are reasonable. Significant estimates made by management include: revenue recognition; inventory valuation; product warranty reserves; allowance for doubtful accounts; accrued restructuring costs; share-based compensation; income taxes
including the valuation of deferred tax assets; fair value measurements; valuation of cost method equity investments; valuation of long-lived assets; and valuation of goodwill.  Risks and Uncertainties  The Company uses financial instruments that
potentially subject it to concentrations of credit risk. Such instruments include cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, trade receivables and financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Company invests cash in cash
deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and readily marketable securities. Investments are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and the credit exposure from any one institution or instrument is
minimized. See Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on these investments.  The Company sells a
significant portion of its products to a small number of large semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers. The top ten customers accounted for approximately 56%, 62% and 56% of total 
  45 


Table of Contents

net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. One consumer electronics manufacturer accounted for approximately 29%, 24% and 30% of total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In
2011, two other customers individually accounted for approximately 11% of total net sales. No other customer individually accounted for more than 10% of total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Companys operating results may be adversely
affected if orders and revenues from these key customers decline.  The Company uses qualified manufacturers to supply many
components and sub-system modules of its products. The systems that the Company manufactures use high-performance computers, peripherals, lasers and other components from various suppliers. The Company obtains some of the components from a single
source or a limited group of suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a particular component would have a temporary adverse impact on the Companys operating results.  The Companys net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rates at March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011 was approximately $45.5
million and $39.7 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $4.6 million and $4.0 million at March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011,
respectively. Foreign exchange rate gains or losses on foreign investments as of March 31, 2012 were reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment, net of tax, and do not affect the Companys results of operations. 
The Companys operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those relating to the
cyclicality of the semiconductor and microelectronics markets, the effect of general economic conditions, rapid changes in technology and international operations.  Cash Equivalents and Investments  All highly liquid investments with
a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments reflect marketable securities that have maturities of less than one year or are subject to immediate pre-payment or call provisions.
These securities consist primarily of marketable debt securities and are classified as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity. To determine whether any existing impairment is other-than-temporary and requires recognition of an impairment loss in the results of operations, the Company evaluates
its marketable securities based on the nature of the investments and the Companys intent and ability to hold the securities until the securities are no longer in an unrealized loss position. 
Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash represents cash which collateralizes commercial letters of credit substituted for a cash bond previously held by the
Kaohsiung District Court of Taiwan related to the Companys proceedings against All Ring Tech Co., Ltd (All Ring). As a part of these proceedings, the Company established three letters of credit for approximately $19.5 million in July
2009, September 2009 and June 2011, which are collateralized by $22.3 million of restricted cash. The Intellectual Property Court in Taiwan is expected to hold its final hearing in this matter in October 2012. The total restricted cash balance
of $22.3 million was included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2012 as a current asset. See Note 21 Legal Proceedings below for further discussion. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. Credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer.
Where appropriate, the Company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to establish or modify credit limits. On certain foreign sales, letters of credit are required. The collectability of trade receivable balances is
regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. If it is

  46 


Table of Contents

determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business, a specific reserve
for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered.  Accrued Restructuring Costs
 The Company has engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require it to make estimates in
certain areas including expenses for severance and other employee separation costs. Because the Company has a history of paying severance benefits, expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable.
Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. See Note 24 Restructuring and Cost Management Plans for further discussion. 
Inventories 
Inventories are principally valued at standard costs, which approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Costs utilized
for inventory valuation purposes include material, labor and manufacturing overhead.  Shipped Systems Pending Acceptance
 Shipped systems pending acceptance relate to systems that have been ordered and shipped to the customer, but have been
deferred in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition policy. Shipped systems pending acceptance are recognized as cost of sales once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met and revenue is recorded. Shipped systems pending
acceptance are valued at standard costs, which approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Costs utilized in the valuation of shipped systems pending acceptance include material, labor and manufacturing overhead and exclude costs
of installation.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed as incurred. Major improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization
are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included as a component of operating expenses.  Long-Lived Asset
Impairment  Long-lived assets, principally property, plant and equipment and identifiable definite-lived intangibles,
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
 The Companys purchased patents are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ten to seventeen years.
 Other purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization
expense is recognized on either a straight-line or sum-of-the-years digits method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which range from one to seven years.

Goodwill Impairment  The Company accounts for goodwill pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 as amended in September 2011 by Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASC ASU 2011-08). ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually. ASC ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more
likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company tests goodwill for impairment using a qualitative and quantitative approach at least annually
or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill was tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and it was determined that there was
no impairment as of March 31, 2012.  Other Assets  Other assets include consignment, demonstration (demo) and training equipment, minority equity investments and long-term deposits.  Consignment, demo and training equipment are recorded at the lower of standard costs or estimated market values, until the assets are sold. 
As of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, the Company had a $9.0 million minority equity investment in preferred stock of
OmniGuide, Inc. (OmniGuide), a private company, which included $6.0 million of Series D Preferred Stock and $3.0 million of Series E Preferred Stock. These investments are accounted for as cost method investments as the Company does not have the
ability to significantly influence OmniGuide. At each reporting period end, the Company determines whether events or circumstances have occurred that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments. If there are
no identified events or circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments, the fair value of the investments are not calculated as it is not practicable to do so. As of March 31, 2012, management had
not identified any events or circumstances that indicated the investments were impaired, therefore the full carrying value of $9.0 million was included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash equivalents and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the nature of the underlying transactions and short-term maturities
involved. Current and non-current marketable securities are recorded at fair value which is defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC Topic 820). ASC Topic 820
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include the following:   


 

 
 Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 


 

 
 Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and   


 

 
 Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
 See Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion and disclosure of fair value on our
financial assets and investments.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Companys primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency risk. The Companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the Companys criteria for designation as hedging transactions, either as cash flow or fair value hedges. A hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of an
asset or a liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. A hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment, is referred to as a fair value hedge. The
criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction and, in most cases, a one-to-one matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction. 
Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the
related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier. Revenue is recognized upon such delivery, provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria
can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of substantially new products, revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements,
the fair value of any undelivered elements is deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met. Revenues are recorded net of taxes collected which are required to be submitted to government authorities. Installation services
are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment and installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete. Neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been
material.  Revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in Japan are recognized upon title transfer,
which generally occurs upon customer acceptance. Revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are generally recognized upon shipment. Revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the
contracts.  Product Warranty  The Company evaluates obligations related to product warranties quarterly. A standard one-year warranty from the date of acceptance is provided on most products. Warranty charges are comprised of costs to
service the warranty, including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items, as well as other costs incidental to the repairs. Warranty charges are recorded net of any cost recoveries resulting from either successful repair
of damaged parts or from warranties offered by the Companys suppliers for defective components. Using historical data, the Company estimates average warranty cost per system or part type and records the provision for such charges as an element
of cost of goods sold upon recognition of the related revenue. Additionally, the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty, and any resulting changes
in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. If circumstances change, or if a significant change in warranty-related incidents occurs, the impact of the change in the warranty accrual could be material. Accrued product warranty is
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accrued liabilities.  Research and Development 
Research and development costs, which include labor and related employee expenses, patent maintenance fees, project materials costs,
project subcontractors, depreciation of engineering equipment, building costs and other administration expenses, are generally expensed as incurred. Engineering materials that are expected to provide future value are included in inventories.

Taxes on Unremitted Foreign Income 
The Company provides for income taxes on its foreign subsidiaries taxable income based on the effective income tax rate in each
respective jurisdiction. The Company provides for deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary, except to the extent that the income is intended to be indefinitely reinvested or remitted in a tax-free liquidation. The only foreign
jurisdiction where the Company is permanently reinvested is Singapore. The cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was $20.9 million and $13.6 million as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011,
respectively. The unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings was $7.3 million and $4.2 million as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, respectively.  Comprehensive Income (Loss)  Comprehensive income (loss) includes
net income (loss) and other comprehensive income, which includes charges or credits to equity that are not the result of transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive income (loss) within these consolidated financial statements includes
primarily cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale. The cumulative translation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2012
and April 2, 2011 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.  Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed utilizing the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS also
considers common stock equivalents, such as stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares and restricted stock units, to the extent that they are not antidilutive. 
Share-Based Compensation  The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of its share-based compensation awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of all share-based compensation awards
on the date of grant, except for unvested restricted stock units, which are valued at the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of award. The Company recognizes the compensation expense for options, SARs and unvested restricted
stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.  Segment Reporting 
The Company complies with ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting (ASC Topic 280). ASC Topic 280, which is based on a management
approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products, major customers and the geographies in which the entity holds material assets and
reports revenue. An operating segment is defined as a component that engages in business activities whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Based on the
provisions of ASC Topic 280, the Company has determined that it operates in one segment. The Company manages its resources and assesses its performance on an enterprise-wide basis.  Employee Benefit Plans  The Company has an employee savings plan
under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2012 and 2011, contributions to the plan by the Company were $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
The Company has defined benefit retirement plans at certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company accounts for these plans based on
the provisions of ASC Topic 715 Compensation-Retirement Benefits.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2011-04 Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASC ASU 2011-04). ASC ASU 2011-04 will result in common fair value measurement and disclosure
requirements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). These disclosures include: (a) information about transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy; (b) information about the sensitivity of a fair value measurement categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those unobservable inputs; and
(c) the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, but for which the fair value of such items is required to be disclosed. The adoption of ASC ASU
2011-04 in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASC ASU 2011-05). ASC ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present components of other
comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity; however, it does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. ASC ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in
stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but continuous statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its
components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASC ASU 2011-12 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral
of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. ASC ASU 2011-12 defers the effective date pertaining to the
requirement in ASC ASU 2011-05 regarding the reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements. The adoption of ASC ASU
2011-05, as amended by ASC ASU 2011-12, will become effective for the Companys first quarter of 2013. The adoption of ASC ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.  In September 2011, the FASB issued ASC ASU 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):
Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASC ASU 2011-08). ASC ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount before
applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test. The Company adopted ASC
ASU 2011-08 in the second quarter of 2012. 
4. Share-Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of its share-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes
model to estimate the fair value of awards on the date of grant, except for unvested restricted stock unit awards, which are valued at the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of award. The Company recognizes compensation
expense for all share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.  Stock Plans
 In October 2004, the shareholders approved the adoption of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) that replaced
various stock compensation plans that were previously approved by the shareholders or the Board of Directors (the Replaced Plans), except with respect to options and other awards previously outstanding. Outstanding options and awards remained
subject to the terms of the Replaced Plans under which they were 
  51 


Table of Contents

originally granted. At that time, the shareholders also approved the reservation of 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares are in addition to any shares
of common stock that, at the time the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, were available for grant under the Replaced Plans or that may subsequently become available for grant under any of the Replaced Plans through the expiration, termination,
forfeiture or cancellation of grants. In January 2005, the Board of Directors approved certain amendments to the 2004 Plan. These amendments prohibit grants of stock options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) with an exercise price
less than fair market value, require that time-based restricted stock awards have a minimum vesting period of at least three years, with the subject shares vesting no more quickly than one-third annually over the three-year period, and expressly
prohibit the reservation of additional shares under the 2004 Plan without shareholder approval. In October 2007, the shareholders approved an additional amendment to the 2004 Plan to permit awards to non-employee service providers and implement
certain claw-back provisions.  The 2004 Plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses
(including restricted stock units), restricted stock, performance-based awards and dividend equivalents. Stock options and SARs outstanding under the 2004 Plan and the Replaced Plans vest over variable periods determined at the grant date, generally
with terms of immediate vesting or up to four years, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options and SARs issued under the 2004 Plan and the Replaced Plans are exercisable at prices not less than fair market value on the date of the grant.
The 2004 Plan prohibits repricing of options and SARs granted without prior shareholder approval. Certain restricted stock units awarded under the 2004 Plan vest based on performance criteria that are tied to the Companys results of
operations, personal performance criteria, and, in certain cases, length of service. Unvested restricted stock awards are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional unvested restricted stock units at the same time and in the same
amount as dividends paid to shareholders of the Company. The dividend equivalents have the same vesting and terms as the underlying restricted stock award.  In September 1990, the shareholders approved the adoption of the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended in September 1998, October 2003, October 2004, January 2008 and August 2009
(the ESPP), pursuant to which 3,400,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to participating employees. Eligible employees may elect to contribute up to 15 percent of their base wage and commissions during each pay period. The
ESPP provides for separate overlapping twenty-four month offerings starting every three months. Each offering has eight purchase dates occurring every three months on designated dates. The offerings under the ESPP commence on
February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each calendar year. Any eligible employee may participate in only one offering at a time and may purchase shares only through payroll deductions permitted under the
ESPP. At the end of each three-month purchase period, the purchase price is determined and the accumulated funds are used to automatically purchase shares of common stock. The purchase price per share is equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair
market value of the common stock on (a) the first day of the offering period or (b) the date of purchase. The ESPP also provides that if the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the new offering period is less than or
equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the first date of any ongoing offering, employees participating in any such ongoing offering will be automatically withdrawn from it and enrolled in the new offering. 
The Company granted SARs starting in the first quarter of 2010. SARs grant the right to receive shares of the Companys stock
equivalent to the increase in stock value of a specified number of shares over a specified period of time, divided by the stock price at the time of exercise. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of SARs. Similar to
options, SARs are recorded at the fair value of the award at grant date and the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. The Company did not grant any stock options during 2012 and 2011 and did
not grant any SARs prior to the first quarter of 2010.

 The share-based compensation expense increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily driven by
accelerated expense associated with the Chief Executive Officers retirement eligibility date and increased attainment of performance-based grants. The share-based compensation expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the
incremental charges from the annual stock grant in 2011.  The total amount of cash received from the stock plan awards was
$3.0 million, $1.3 million and $1.4 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. All stock plan awards are settled with newly issued shares.  No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2012. As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $11.2 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures,
which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.51 years.  Valuation Assumptions

 The risk-free interest rates used are based on the U.S. Treasury yields over the expected terms. In
December 2012, the Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends. Accordingly, the Company paid a dividend of $0.08 per outstanding common share in the fourth quarter of 2012. There were
no dividends declared or paid during 2011 and 2010. The expected dividend yield used is derived using a mathematical formula which uses the expected Company annual dividend rate over the expected term divided by the fair value of the Companys
common stock at the grant date.  The expected term and forfeiture estimates for stock options and SARs are based on an
analysis of actual exercise behavior. The expected term for the ESPP is the weighted average length of the purchase periods. The Company uses its historical volatility over the estimated expected term as the expected volatility.

5. Fair Value Measurements 
Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value  ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include the following: 
 


 

 
 Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 


 

 
 Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and   


 


 For Level 1 assets, the Company utilized quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
 For Level 2 assets, exclusive of forward contracts, the Company utilized quoted prices in active markets for similar assets.
For forward contracts, spot prices at March 30, 2012 and April 1, 2011 were utilized to calculate fair values.  The
Level 3 assets consisted of ARS and preferred stock acquired through the conversion of ARS. As none of the Companys ARS traded through the auction process, estimated fair values were based primarily upon the income approach using a discounted
cash flow model which took into account the following: (i) the underlying 
  55 


Table of Contents

structure of each security; (ii) the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates that reflect current market conditions; (iii) consideration of the
probabilities of default, restructuring or redemption by the issuer (trigger events); (iv) estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each security; (v) the financial condition, results, ratings of and financial claims on
the bond insurers and issuers; and (vi) the underlying trust assets of the securities.  During 2012, there were no
transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets. As of March 31, 2012, the Company did not hold any ARS investments. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company sold all of its remaining ARS for approximately $6.0 million and all of its
preferred stock for approximately $0.5 million. These ARS had a total estimated fair value of $5.2 million as of April 2, 2011, which consisted of $10.7 million par value ARS and $4.0 million par value ARS which were converted by the bond
issuer to its preferred stock in 2009. The Company recorded a gain of $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, which included $1.4 million in reclassification of previously recorded unrealized gain out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
 As of April 2, 2011, the Company held ARS with a total estimated fair value of $5.2 million. The contractual maturities
of these securities range up to calendar year 2050, and several securities and the preferred stock do not have stated maturities. These securities previously provided short-term liquidity through a Dutch auction process that reset the applicable
interest rate at pre-determined calendar intervals, generally every 28 to 35 days. As a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, the Companys ARS began to experience failed auctions during fiscal
2008.  Since that time, none of the Companys ARS traded through the auction process and the credit quality of the
counterparties deteriorated. Consequently, it was determined that the declines in fair value of these securities in 2010 and 2009 represented other-than-temporary impairments in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.3 million in 2010. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of ARS in 2012 and 2011.  As of the beginning of 2010, in accordance with the adoption of ASC Topic 320 Investments  Debt and Equity Securities (ASC Topic 320), the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment
to increase the opening balance of retained earnings by $0.4 million, which represented the non-credit portion of the ARS loss previously recorded as an other-than-temporary impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The credit portion
of the ARS loss was determined by direct estimation of the change in fair value attributable to market movements. The Company utilized market indices representing investments of constant credit quality over time and measured the index yield, which
is considered attributable to non-credit related factors, at the beginning and end of the period. The effect of this change in yield on the value of the security was measured and subtracted from the total change in fair value to arrive at the
estimated change in value attributable to changes in credit quality.  As of April 2, 2011, the estimated fair value of
the Companys ARS of $5.2 million included $1.4 million of total net unrealized gains. These unrealized gains were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Companys ARS were classified as non-current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at April 2, 2011.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company sold a certain ARS with a
par value of $3.0 million for approximately $0.7 million. The Company recorded a gain of $0.7 million in 2011 as the security was previously written down to zero value. During 2010, the Company sold certain ARS with a par value of $1.9 million
pursuant to a tender agreement with the parent company of the securities original issuer. The Company received approximately $1.4 million on the sale of the ARS, which had an estimated fair value of $1.6 million prior to the quarter in which
it was sold. As a result of the sale in 2010, the Company reclassified $0.3 million of the previously recorded unrealized net gain out of accumulated other comprehensive income.

 As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $6.0 million invested in Series D Preferred Stock and $3.0
million invested in Series E Preferred Stock of OmniGuide, Inc., representing an 11% interest. At each reporting period end, the Company determines whether events or circumstances have occurred that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on
the fair value of these investments. If there are no events or circumstances identified that would adversely affect the fair value of the investments, the fair values of the investments are not calculated as it is not practicable to do so. As of
March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, management had not identified any events or circumstances that indicated the investments were impaired; therefore, as presented in Note 12 Other Assets, the full carrying value of $9.0 million
was included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011.

 In addition to the sales of ARS, the Company sold certain available-for-sale securities for approximately
$3.5 million at cost during 2012. Other than the sale of ARS discussed above, the Company had no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2011.  For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses and reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the cost of securities sold is based on specific identification. Net
unrealized holding gains and losses on current available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were insignificant as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011. 
Underlying maturities of investments at March 31, 2012 were $148.0 million within one year and $23.0 million between one to five
years. 
6. Business Acquisition 
In September 2010, the Company acquired certain assets of PyroPhotonics Lasers, Inc. (PyroPhotonics), a manufacturer of
tailored-pulse fiber lasers, for approximately $8.1 million in cash plus acquisition related costs of approximately $0.3 million. The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values.
Analyses supporting the purchase price allocation included a valuation of assets and liabilities as of the closing date, an analysis of intangible assets and a detailed review of the opening balance sheet to determine other significant adjustments
required to recognize assets and liabilities at fair value.

1.
See Note 11 Acquired Intangible Assets for additional discussion.  The acquisition was an investment to integrate PyroPhotonics technology into certain of the Companys product groups, which supported the premium paid over the fair market value of the
individual assets. As a result, the Company recorded $4.0 million of goodwill. A portion of the goodwill amount is deductible for tax purposes.  As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $3.6 million of identifiable intangible assets including $3.2 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D) at the date of the
acquisition. The IPR&D program consisted of three laser platforms with primary focus on PyroFlex-25. The PyroFlex-25 is a unique pulse-programmable fiber laser platform designed to serve a broad range of industrial applications. The
PyroFlex-25 is currently in the final stages of development, aimed towards a full production release in fiscal 2013.  In
determining the value of in-process research and development, the Company applied the excess earnings method. The key value drivers under the excess earnings method are as follows: (a) projected revenue and earnings generated by the assets;
(b) expected economic life of the asset; (c) contributory asset charges that would be paid to the requisite operating assets; and (d) a discount rate which reflects risk associated with receiving future cash flows. Forecasted sales
and expenses were projected individually for these three laser platforms including PyroFlex-25. The selected discount rate for the IPR&D was 25.6%. In applying a discount rate for the IPR&D, the Company considered the overall weighted
average cost of capital of PyroPhotonics.  The operating results of this acquisition are included in the Companys
results of operations since the date of acquisition.

 Depreciation expense totaled $12.5 million, $10.3 million and $10.0 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. In 2012, the Company recorded $1.7 million of accelerated depreciation expense for certain assets. The Company shortened the depreciable lives of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 largely as a result of consolidating
facilities in the United States and Asia. 
10. Goodwill 
As of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, the Company had $4.0 million in goodwill because of the PyroPhotonics
acquisition in 2011. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $3.6 million of identifiable intangible assets and $4.0 million of goodwill. See Note 6 Business Acquisition for additional discussion.

13. Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax balances of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes resulting from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. When management determines that it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be fully realized, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

 As of March 31, 2012 the Company had approximately $32.4 million in tax assets resulting from
federal, state and foreign net operating losses and tax credits. A detailed breakdown of the net operating loss carryforwards (tax-effected) and tax credits at March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011 was as follows:

 The federal net operating losses expire in fiscal 2032. The state net operating losses expire on various
dates through fiscal 2032. The majority of the foreign tax credits expire on various dates through fiscal 2022. The federal and most of the state research credits expire on various dates through fiscal 2032. Certain state research credits and the
federal minimum tax credits are available indefinitely.  A valuation allowance of $11.1 million and $10.5 million was recorded
as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, respectively. The valuation allowance increased by $0.6 million in 2012, increased by $1.0 million in 
  62 


Table of Contents

2011, and decreased by $1.7 million in 2010. The increase in the valuation allowance in 2012 was primarily due to higher foreign deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized. Future
adjustments to the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets may be recorded with changes in future forecasts of taxable income. Based upon historical and future expectations of taxable income, the Company believes that its valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets is adequate and that it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets of $46.5 million at March 31, 2012 will be realized within the applicable carryforward periods.

 The unrecognized tax benefits, along with the related accrued interest and penalties, were presented as
short-term and long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011. The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $8.6
million as of March 31, 2012 and $8.0 million at April 2, 2011. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes. Gross accrued interest and penalties were $2.2 million
and $2.3 million as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, respectively. The gross amount of interest and penalties incurred during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million respectively. The Company expects a $1.5
million decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months from the lapse in statutes of limitation. The Company also expects the annual increases to be consistent with prior years and does not anticipate any significant changes in
unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months as the result of examinations.

 Net warranty charges incurred include labor charges and costs of replacement parts for system repairs
under warranty. These costs are recorded net of any estimated cost recoveries resulting from either successful repair of damaged parts or from warranties offered by the Companys suppliers for defective components. The provision for warranty
charges reflects the estimate of future anticipated net warranty costs to be incurred for all products under warranty at fiscal year end and is recorded to cost of sales.

17. Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments on a limited basis and does not use them for trading purposes.
It does, however, use derivatives to manage well-defined foreign currency risks. The Company hedges material non-functional currency monetary asset and liability balances. Foreign exchange contract gains and losses are recognized at the end of each
fiscal period in the Companys results of operations. Such gains and losses are typically offset by the corresponding changes to the related underlying hedged item. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified in the same
category as the cash flows from the items hedged.  At March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, the Company had net forward
exchange contracts to (sell) purchase foreign currencies totaling ($1.3) million and $5.6 million, respectively. In general, these contracts mature in less than six months and the counterparties are large, highly rated banks; therefore, the Company
believes that the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by the banks is minimal.  The table below summarizes, by
currency, the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts in U.S. dollars as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011. The bought amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies,
and the sold amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalents of commitments to sell foreign currencies. The foreign currency amounts have been translated into a U.S. dollar equivalent value using the exchange rates as of March 31,
2012 and April 2, 2011.

 The Company leases certain equipment, automobiles, manufacturing and office space under operating leases,
which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates through fiscal 2016. Rental expense for all operating leases was $2.3 million, $2.3 million and $1.9 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
In the normal course of business, the Company agrees to indemnify customers with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed,
under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from other third party claims that the Companys products, when used for their intended purposes, infringe the intellectual property
rights of such other third parties. To date, the Company has not recorded any material charges related to these types of obligations.

 Awards of options, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs)
representing an additional 2.7 million, 2.9 million and 4.5 million shares of stock for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted net earnings per share because their effect would have been
antidilutive. 
20. Shareholders Equity 
Share Repurchase Program  On May 15, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of the Companys outstanding common stock primarily to offset dilution from
equity compensation programs. The repurchases were to be made at managements discretion in the open market or in 
  66 


Table of Contents

privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. There was no
fixed completion date for the repurchase program.  The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program during 2012
and 2011. Through March 31, 2012, a total of 372,825 shares had been repurchased for $5.3 million under this authorization at an average price of $14.16 per share, calculated inclusive of commissions and fees. Any cash used to settle repurchase
transactions is reflected as a component of cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
On December 9, 2011, the Board of Directors terminated the prior repurchase program and authorized a new share repurchase program
totaling $20.0 million to acquire shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. The repurchases are to be made at managements discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable
securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2012. There is no fixed completion date for the repurchase program.
 Dividends  On December 9, 2011, the Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends. The following table summarizes the dividend declared and paid by
the Company during 2012:

$    0.08
 During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company paid the dividend at the rate of $0.08 per outstanding
common share for a total amount of $2.3 million. Subsequent to the year ended March 31, 2012, the Board of Directors declared an $0.08 per outstanding common share cash dividend on May 10, 2012. The estimated amount to be paid as a result
of the May 10, 2012 declaration is $2.3 million.  ESI currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends
on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration, timing and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on ESIs financial condition, results of operations, capital
requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of ESIs shareholders. 
21. Legal Proceedings 
Legal Settlement  In 2009, James Dooley, former Chief Executive Officer, initiated arbitration against the Company seeking severance in connection with his 2003 termination for cause. On December 10, 2010, the
arbitrator ruled that, despite having pled guilty to violating federal securities laws by willfully and knowingly making false statements to the Companys accountants, Dooleys actions did not satisfy the definition of cause under his
employment agreement. As a result, the arbitrator determined that Dooley is entitled to severance benefits under his employment agreement, plus interest from June 2005. This proceeding was subject to binding arbitration under the terms of the
employment agreement. Accordingly, the Company recognized approximately $1.4 million in legal settlement costs in 2011. On December 27, 2010, the Company filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief to vacate the arbitration award with the
United States District Court, District of Oregon. On May 17, 2011, the court ruled in favor of Mr. Dooley. On May 19, 2011, the Company filed a motion for the court to admit into evidence certain testimony of Mr. Dooley, arguing
that the court was in error in not admitting it in the 
  67 


Table of Contents

proceeding, and asking the court to reconsider its ruling based on that evidence. On June 14, 2011, the court ruled in favor of admitting the testimony into evidence, but also reaffirmed its
original ruling upholding the arbitrators award. The Company did not further appeal and paid the award in the first quarter of 2012. 
All Ring Patent Infringement Prosecution  In August 2005, the Company commenced a proceeding in the Kaohsiung District Court of Taiwan (the Court) directed against All Ring Tech Co., Ltd. (All Ring) of Taiwan. The Company alleged that All
Rings Capacitor Tester Model RK-T6600 (the Capacitor Tester) infringes ESIs Taiwan Patent No. 207469, entitled Circuit Component Handler (the 207469 patent). As part of this proceeding, the Court issued a Provisional
Attachment Order (PAO) in August 2005, restricting the use of some of All Rings assets. All Ring then filed a bond with the Court to obtain relief from the attachment of its assets. In July 2007, the Court issued a second PAO and approximately
$6.0 million was restricted in All Rings accounts. The second PAO remains in effect and cannot be revoked.  In October
2005, the Company filed a formal patent infringement action against All Ring in the Court. Also in October 2005, the Court executed a Preliminary Injunction Order (PIO) that prohibits All Ring from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale or using
the Capacitor Tester until final judgment is entered in the formal patent infringement action. The Court dismissed All Rings application to revoke the PIO on January 18, 2008, and the PIO remains in place. 
On June 3, 2011 the Court orally announced its judgment, finding that the Capacitor Tester, as well as All Rings RK-T2000 and
RK-L50 systems, had infringed the 207469 patent, ordering All Ring to pay the Company approximately $24 million in damages, plus interest accrued from November 4, 2005 through the payment date at a rate of 5%, and enjoining All Ring from
selling the infringing systems. The written judgment was issued on June 13, 2011. On June 16, 2011, All Ring posted a cash bond for approximately $24.0 million to prevent the provisional execution of the judgment. All Ring appealed this
judgment to the Intellectual Property Court on June 28, 2011 and on October 31, 2011, the Company filed its response to All Rings appeal. The Company and All Ring have each filed additional briefs with the Intellectual Property
Court. The Intellectual Property Court is expected to hold its final hearing in this matter in October 2012.  As a part of
these proceedings, the Company established three letters of credit for approximately $19.5 million in July 2009, September 2009 and June 2011, which are collateralized by $22.3 million of restricted cash. The total restricted cash balance of
$22.3 million was included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2012 as a current asset. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various other legal matters, either asserted or unasserted, and
investigations. In the opinion of management, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
22. Shareholder Rights Plan 
The Company has a shareholder rights plan, under which each share of common stock carries with it an associated right
(a Right). Each Right entitles the holder to purchase 1/100 of a share of Series A No Par Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $60, subject to adjustment. The Rights do not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become
exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the Companys earnings. The Rights expire on May 18, 2019 and may be redeemed by the Company for $0.001 per Right.  The Rights are not presently exercisable and will only become exercisable following the occurrence of certain specified events, including the following: (a) a person or group acquires or commences a
tender offer that would result in beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of outstanding common stock; (b) any person becomes a beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of outstanding common stock and is determined by the Board of Directors to
be an Adverse Person; or (c) a person or group acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, 15 percent of the outstanding Common Stock. If either of the events described in clause (b) or (c) above occurs, each

  68 


Table of Contents

Right will thereafter entitle its holder to receive, upon exercise and in lieu of Series A No Par Preferred Stock, Common Stock (or in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of
the Company) having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right. If, after the Rights become exercisable as described above, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each Right will thereafter entitle its holder
to receive, upon exercise and in lieu of capital stock of the Company, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right.

24. Restructuring and Cost Management Plans 
During 2011, as part of the Companys globalization strategy, the Company initiated restructuring plans to reduce
its worldwide cost structure through transition of certain procurement and manufacturing activities to Asia. In 2012, the Company continued its globalization effort and it additionally identified and initiated other cost reduction actions. The
estimated completion date for these actions is September 30, 2012.  As a result of these actions, the Company recognized
$3.8 million and $0.8 million of restructuring costs in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The corresponding liability was included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restructuring costs of $3.8 million incurred in 2012 were
comprised primarily of $1.9 million of employee severance and related benefits and $1.7 million of accelerated depreciation for certain assets. The Company shortened the depreciable lives of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 largely as a
result of consolidating facilities in the United States and Asia. The restructuring costs of $0.8 million recognized in 2011 consisted primarily of employee severance and related benefits. At March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, the amount of
unpaid restructuring costs included in accrued liabilities was $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures  Attached to this annual report as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 are the certifications of our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required by Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications). This Controls and Procedures section of our annual report on Form 10-K is our disclosure of the conclusions of our management, including our CEO and our CFO, regarding the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on managements evaluation of those disclosure controls and procedures. This section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K should be
read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.  (a) Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This controls evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO. Disclosure controls are
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below.  The
evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design as well as their effect on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that
the conclusions of management, including the CEO and CFO, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also
evaluated on an ongoing basis by our finance organization. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic
systems that we adjust as circumstances merit.  Based on the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, subject
to the limitations noted in (c) below, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that material information relating to the Company is made known to management, including the CEO and the CFO, particularly during the time when
our periodic reports are being prepared.  (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2012 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2012. 
  72 


Table of Contents
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has performed an independent
assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as referenced in their report included in (e) below. 
(c) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 (d) Changes in Internal Control  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal control over financial reporting.

(e) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders  Electro
Scientific Industries, Inc.:  We have audited Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A(b). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012 and April 2, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 31, 2012, and our report dated June 12, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  /s/
