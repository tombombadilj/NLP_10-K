Item 1.
Business  Introduction 
Maxwell was incorporated under the name Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. in 1965. The Company made an initial public offering of common stock in
1983, and changed its name to Maxwell Technologies, Inc. in 1996. Today, we develop, manufacture and market energy storage and power delivery products for transportation, industrial, telecommunications and other applications and microelectronic
products for space and satellite applications. Our products are designed and manufactured to perform reliably with minimal maintenance for the life of the applications into which they are integrated. We believe that this
life-of-the-application reliability gives our products a competitive advantage and enables them to command higher profit margins than commodity products. We focus on the following lines of high-reliability products: 
 


 

 
 Ultracapacitors: Our primary focus is on ultracapacitors, energy storage devices that are characterized by high power density, long operational
life and the ability to charge and discharge very rapidly. Our ultracapacitor products provide energy storage and power delivery solutions for applications in multiple industries, including transportation, automotive, information technology,
renewable energy and industrial electronics.   


 

 
 High-Voltage Capacitors: Our CONDIS® high-voltage capacitors are designed and manufactured to perform reliably for decades in all climates. These products include grading and coupling capacitors and
capacitive voltage dividers that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport, distribution and measurement of high-voltage electrical energy.
  


 

 
 Radiation-Hardened Microelectronic Products: Our radiation-hardened microelectronic products for satellites and spacecraft include single board
computers and components, such as high-density memory and power modules. Many of these products incorporate our proprietary
RADPAK® packaging and shielding technology and novel architectures that enable them to withstand the effects of
environmental radiation and perform reliably in space.  General Product Line Overview 
Ultracapacitors 
Ultracapacitors enhance the efficiency and reliability of devices or systems that generate or consume electrical energy. They differ from
other energy storage and power delivery products in that they combine rapid charge/discharge capabilities typically associated with film and electrolytic capacitors with energy storage capacity generally associated with batteries. Although batteries
store significantly more electrical energy than ultracapacitors, they cannot charge and discharge as rapidly and efficiently as ultracapacitors. Conversely, although electrolytic capacitors can deliver bursts of high power very rapidly, they have
extremely limited energy storage capacity, and therefore cannot sustain power delivery for as much as a full second. Also, unlike batteries, which store electrical energy by means of a chemical reaction and experience gradual depletion of their
energy storage and power delivery capability over hundreds to a few thousand charge/discharge cycles, ultracapacitors energy storage and power delivery mechanisms involve no chemical reaction, so they can be charged and discharged hundreds of
thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation. This ability to store energy, deliver bursts of power and perform reliably for many years with little or no maintenance makes ultracapacitors an attractive energy-efficiency option
for a wide range of energy-consuming and generating devices and systems.  Based on potential volumes, we believe that the
transportation industry represents the largest market opportunity for ultracapacitors. Transportation applications include braking energy recuperation and torque- augmentation systems for hybrid-electric buses, trucks and autos and electric rail
vehicles, vehicle power network smoothing and stabilization, engine starting systems for internal combustion vehicles and burst power for idle stop-start systems.

Table of Contents
Our ultracapacitor products have become a standard and often preferred energy storage
solution for transportation applications such as hybrid-electric transit buses and electric rail systems and industrial electronics applications such as wind energy, automated utility meters in smart grid systems and backup power for
telecommunications and information technology installations.  To reduce manufacturing cost and improve the performance of our
ultracapacitor products, we developed a proprietary, solvent-free, process to produce the carbon film electrode material which accounts for a significant portion of the cost of ultracapacitor cells. This process has enabled us to become a low-cost
producer of electrode material, and our favorable cost position has enabled us to market electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers. Although we do not intend to license this electrode technology to other ultracapacitor or electrode
manufacturers, we have licensed our proprietary cell architecture to manufacturers in China, Taiwan and Korea to expand and accelerate acceptance of ultracapacitor products in large and rapidly growing global markets. 
High-Voltage Capacitors 
High-voltage grading and coupling capacitors and capacitive voltage dividers are used mainly in the electric utility industry. Grading and
coupling capacitors are key components of circuit breakers that prevent high-voltage arcing that can damage switches, step-down transformers and other equipment that transmits or distributes high-voltage electrical energy in electric utility
infrastructure and high voltage laboratories. Capacitive voltage dividers measure voltage and power levels in overhead transmission lines. The market for these products consists of expansion, upgrading and maintenance of existing infrastructure and
new infrastructure installations in developing countries. Such installations are capital-intensive and frequently are subject to regulation, availability of government funding and general economic conditions. For example, while North America has a
large installed base of electric utility infrastructure, and has experienced power interruptions and supply problems, utility deregulation, government budget deficits, and other factors have limited recent capital spending in what historically has
been a very large market for utility infrastructure components. We experienced a decline in sales of our high voltage products in 2010, which may correlate to global economic conditions, including limited credit availability to finance utility grid
projects. However, credit availability and general global economic conditions improved somewhat in 2011, and, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, sales of our high voltage products in 2011 remained flat as compared
with 2010. We believe that our high voltage product sales may recover to a growth pattern in future years as projects to increase the availability of electrical energy in developing countries and infrastructure modernization and renovation in
developed countries drive increasing demand for our high-voltage products.  Radiation-Hardened Microelectronics 
Radiation-hardened microelectronic products are used almost exclusively in space and satellite applications. Because satellites and
spacecraft are extremely expensive to manufacture and launch, and space missions typically span years or even decades, and because it is impractical or impossible to repair or replace malfunctioning parts, the industry demands electronic components
that are virtually failure-free. Because satellites and spacecraft routinely encounter ionizing radiation from solar flares and other natural sources, onboard microelectronic components must be able to withstand such radiation and continue to
perform reliably. For that reason, suppliers of components for space applications historically used only special radiation-hardened silicon in the manufacture of such components. However, since the space market is relatively small and the process of
producing rad-hard silicon is very expensive, only a few government-funded wafer fabrication facilities are capable of producing such material. In addition, because it takes several years to produce a rad-hard version of a new
semiconductor, components using rad-hard silicon typically are several generations behind their current commercial counterparts in terms of density, processing power and functionality. 
To address the performance gap between rad-hard and commercial silicon and provide components with both increased functionality and
significantly greater processing power, Maxwell and a few other specialty components suppliers have developed shielding, packaging, and other radiation mitigation techniques that allow sensitive commercial semiconductors to withstand space radiation
effects and perform as reliably as components

incorporating rad-hard semiconductors. Although this market is limited in size, the value proposition for high-performance, radiation-tolerant, components enables us to generate profit margins
much higher than those for commodity electronic components.  Business Strategy 
Our primary objective is to significantly increase the companys revenue and profit margins by creating and satisfying demand for
ultracapacitor-based energy storage and power delivery solutions. To accomplish this, we are focusing on:  Establishing and expanding
market opportunities for ultracapacitors by:   


 

 
 Collaborating with key existing and prospective customers in development of ultracapacitor-based solutions for strategic applications;
  


 

 
 Demonstrating the efficiency, durability and safety of our ultracapacitor products through extensive internal and third party testing;
  


 

 
 Integrating mathematical models for ultracapacitors into simulation software used by system designers; 
 


 

 
 Participating in a broad array of working groups, consortia and industry standards committees to disseminate knowledge of, and promote the use of,
ultracapacitors; and   


 

 
 Manufacturing products that are environmentally compatible.  Becoming a preferred ultracapacitor supplier by:   


 

 
 Being a low-cost producer and demonstrating ultracapacitors value proposition; 
 


 

 
 Designing and manufacturing products with life-of-the-application durability; 
 


 

 
 Building a robust supply chain through global sourcing; 
 


 

 
 Achieving superior performance and manufacturing quality while reducing product cost; 
 


 

 
 Developing and deploying enabling technologies and systems, including cell-to-cell and module-to-module balancing and integrated charging systems,
among others;   


 

 
 Marketing high-performance, low-cost electrode material to other manufacturers; and 
 


 

 
 Establishing and maintaining broad and deep protections of key intellectual property. 
We also seek to expand market opportunities and revenue for our high-voltage capacitors and radiation-hardened microelectronic products.
While these products have highly specialized applications, we are a technology leader in the markets they serve, and thus are able to sell our products at attractive profit margins. To maintain and expand this competitive position we are leveraging
our technological expertise to develop new products that not only meet the demands of our current markets, but also address additional applications. For example, our microelectronics group introduced an advanced single-board computer
(SBC) for the space and satellite market, addressing an application that we did not previously serve. In 2005, Northrop Grumman Space Technologies, prime contractor for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite
System, the U.S. governments next generation weather satellite constellation, selected our SCS750 SBC for spacecraft control and data management. In October 2007, Astrium, a subsidiary of EADS, selected the SCS750 to process images
gathered by a satellite Astrium has contracted to produce for the European Space Agencys Gaia astronomy mission. 
Products and Applications 
Our products incorporate our know-how and proprietary energy storage and power delivery and microelectronics technologies at both the
component and system levels for specialized, high-value applications that demand life-of-the-application reliability.

Ultracapacitors  Ultracapacitors, also known as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or supercapacitors, store energy electrostatically by polarizing an organic salt solution within a sealed package.
Although ultracapacitors are electrochemical devices, no chemical reaction is involved in their energy storage mechanism. Their electrostatic energy storage mechanism is fully reversible, allowing ultracapacitors to be rapidly charged and discharged
hundreds of thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation, even in the most demanding heavy charge/discharge applications.  Compared with electrolytic capacitors, which have very low energy storage capacity and discharge power too rapidly to be suitable for many power delivery applications, ultracapacitors have much greater
energy storage capacity and can deliver energy over time periods ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes. 
Compared with batteries, which require minutes or hours to fully charge or discharge, ultracapacitors discharge and recharge in as little
as fractions of a second. Although ultracapacitors store only about five to ten percent as much electrical energy as a battery of comparable size, they can deliver or absorb electric energy up to 100 times more rapidly than batteries. Because they
operate reliably through hundreds of thousands to millions of deep discharge cycles, compared with only hundreds to a few thousand equivalent cycles for batteries, ultracapacitors have significantly higher lifetime energy throughput, which equates
to significantly lower cost on a life cycle basis.  We link our ultracapacitor cells together in multi-cell modules to satisfy
energy storage and power delivery requirements of varying voltages. Both individual cells and multi-cell products can be charged from any primary energy source, such as a battery, generator, fuel cell, solar panel, wind turbine or electrical outlet.
Virtually any device or system whose intermittent peak power demands are greater than its average continuous power requirement is a candidate for an ultracapacitor-based energy storage and power delivery solution. 
Our ultracapacitor products have significant advantages over batteries, including: 
 


 

 
 the ability to deliver up to 100 times more instantaneous power; 
 


 

 
 significantly lower weight per unit of electrical energy stored; 
 


 

 
 the ability to discharge deeper and recharge faster and more efficiently, minimizing energy loss; 
 


 

 
 the ability to operate reliably and continuously in extreme temperatures (-40 degrees C to +65 degrees C); 
 


 

 
 minimal to no maintenance requirements;   


 

 
 life of the application durability; and   


 

 
 minimal environmental issues associated with disposal because they contain no heavy metals. 
With no moving parts and no chemical reactions involved in their energy storage mechanism, ultracapacitors provide a simple, highly
reliable, solid state-like solution to buffer short-term mismatches between power available and power required. Additionally, ultracapacitors offer the advantage of storing energy in the same form in which it is used, as electricity.
 Emerging applications, including increasing use of electric power in vehicles, wireless communication systems and growing
demand for highly reliable, maintenance-free, back-up power for telecommunication information technology and industrial installations are creating significant opportunities for more efficient and reliable energy storage and power delivery products.
In many applications, power demand varies widely from moment to moment, and peak power demand typically is much greater than the average power requirement. For example, automobiles require 10 times more power to accelerate than to maintain a
constant speed, and forklifts require more power to lift a heavy pallet of material than to move from place to place within a warehouse.

Engineers historically have addressed transient peak power requirements by over-sizing the
engine, battery or other primary energy source to satisfy all of a systems power demands, including demands that occur infrequently and may last only fractions of a second. Sizing a primary power source to meet brief peak power requirements,
rather than for average power requirements, is costly and inefficient. When a primary energy source is coupled with ultracapacitors, which can deliver or absorb brief bursts of high power on demand for periods of time ranging from fractions of a
second to several minutes, the primary energy source can be smaller, lighter and less expensive.  The following diagram
depicts the separation of a primary energy storage source from a peak power delivery component to satisfy the requirements of a particular application. Components that enable this separation allow designers to optimize the size, efficiency and cost
of the entire electrical power system.  Peak Power Application Model 
  

 Although batteries have been the most widely used component for both energy storage and peak power
delivery, ultracapacitors, more advanced batteries and flywheels now enable system designers to separate and optimize these functions. Based in part on our ultracapacitor products declining cost, high performance and
life-of-the-application durability, they are becoming a preferred solution for many energy storage and power delivery applications.  We offer our ultracapacitors cells in cylindrical and prismatic form factors, ranging in capacitance from 1 to 3,000 farads. Applications such as hybrid-electric bus, truck and auto drive trains, electric
rail systems and UPS systems require integrated energy storage systems consisting of up to hundreds of ultracapacitor cells. To facilitate adoption of ultracapacitors for these larger systems, we have developed integration technologies, including
proprietary electrical balancing and thermal management systems and interconnect technologies. We have applied for patents for certain of these technologies. We offer a broad range of standard multi-cell modules to provide fully integrated solutions
for applications requiring up to 1,500 volts of power. Our current standard multi-cell products each incorporate from six to 48 of our large cells to provide plug and play solutions for applications requiring from 16 to 125 volts. In
addition, our multi-cell modules are designed to be linked together for higher voltage applications.

High-Voltage Capacitors  Electric utility infrastructure includes switches, circuit breakers, step-down transformers and measurement instruments that transmit, distribute and measure high-voltage electrical energy. High-voltage
capacitors are used to protect these systems from high-voltage arcing. With operational lifetimes measured in decades, these applications require high reliability and durability. 
Through our acquisition in 2002 of Montena Components Ltd., now known as Maxwell Technologies SA, and its CONDIS® line of high-voltage capacitor products, Maxwell has more than 20 years of experience in this industry, and is the
worlds largest producer of such products for use in utility infrastructure. Engineers with specific expertise in high-voltage systems develop, design and test our high-voltage capacitor products in our development and production facility in
Rossens, Switzerland. Our high-voltage capacitors are produced through a proprietary assembly and automated winding process to ensure consistent quality and reliability. We have upgraded and expanded our high-voltage capacitor production facility
over the past five years to double its output capacity and significantly shorten order-to-delivery intervals.  We sell our
high-voltage capacitor products to large systems integrators, which install and service power plants and electrical utility infrastructure worldwide.  Radiation-Hardened Microelectronic Products  Manufacturers of satellites
and other spacecraft require microelectronic components and sub-systems that meet specific functional requirements and can withstand exposure to gamma rays, hot electrons and protons and other environmental radiation encountered in space. In the
past, microelectronic components and systems for such special applications used only specially fabricated radiation-hardened silicon. However, the process of designing and producing rad-hard silicon is lengthy and expensive, and there are only a few
specialty semiconductor wafer fabricators, so supplies of rad-hard silicon are limited. Therefore, demand for space-qualified components made with higher-performance, lower-cost commercial silicon, protected by shielding and other radiation
mitigation techniques, has grown. Producing our components and systems incorporating radiation-hardened commercial silicon requires expertise in power electronics, circuit design, silicon selection, radiation shielding and quality assurance testing.
 We design, manufacture and market radiation-hardened microelectronic products, including single-board computers and
components such as memory and power modules, for the space and satellite markets. Using highly adaptable, proprietary, packaging and shielding technology and other radiation mitigation techniques, we design and manufacture products that allow
satellite and spacecraft manufacturers to use powerful, low cost, commercial semiconductors that are protected with the level of radiation mitigation required for reliable performance in the specific orbit or environment in which they are to be
deployed.  Manufacturing  Our internal manufacturing operations are conducted in production facilities located in San Diego, California, and Rossens, Switzerland, and we are in the process of establishing a second U.S. production
facility in Peoria, Arizona, near Phoenix. We have made substantial capital investments to outfit and expand our internal production facilities and incorporate mechanization and automation techniques and processes. We have trained our manufacturing
personnel in advanced operational techniques, added information technology infrastructure and implemented new business processes and systems to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency, planning and product quality. All of our
ultracapacitor electrode material currently is produced at our San Diego facility, where we have installed new electrode fabrication equipment that doubled production capacity between 2009 and 2011. By the end of 2012, we will bring online
additional electrode production capacity in Peoria that will roughly match the current capacity of the San Diego facility. In 2007, we outsourced assembly of our 60mm diameter large cell ultracapacitors, and subsequently, assembly of large
cell-based multi-cell modules to Belton Technology Group (Belton), a contract manufacturer based in Shenzhen, China. During the first quarter of 2011, Belton installed a new large cell assembly module that doubled its previous production

  7

capacity, and further capacity expansion is scheduled to be completed during 2012. In 2010, we outsourced assembly of our mid-size D-cell ultracapacitor products and D-cell-based
multi-cell modules to the Lishen Battery Company (Lishen), Chinas largest producer of lithium-ion batteries, based in Tianjin. With the completion of the above-noted electrode and large cell ultracapacitor capacity expansions, we
believe that we will have sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand for all of our product lines.  Ultracapacitors 
We currently produce 10-farad prismatic ultracapacitor cells and our new engine start module, on production lines in our San Diego
facility. As noted above, we have outsourced assembly of all other cell types and multi-cell modules to contract manufacturers in Asia. To reduce cost, simplify assembly and facilitate automation, we have redesigned our ultracapacitor products to
incorporate lower-cost materials and to reduce both the number of parts in a finished cell and the number of manufacturing process steps required to produce them. We intend to continue outsourcing future additional increments of cell and module
assembly capacity to countries with low-cost labor, but plan to continue to produce our proprietary electrode material only in internal production facilities.  We produce electrode material for our own ultracapacitor products, and for sale to other ultracapacitor manufacturers, such as Yeong-Long Technologies Co., Ltd., (YEC) and Shanghai Sanjiu
Electric Equipment Company, Ltd., at our San Diego headquarters location. In 2007, we completed installation of an advanced carbon powder processing system as part of a major electrode capacity expansion in San Diego, and we will install a similar
system in our Peoria Arizona facility in 2012. This new facility will give us sufficient capacity to support both our current ultracapacitor production requirements and external electrode demand in the near term. As demand increases, additional
increments of electrode production capacity can be added within a few months of placing an order with established equipment vendors. We intend to continue producing this proprietary material internally, and do not contemplate licensing our
solvent-free electrode fabrication process to ultracapacitor electrode customers or competing suppliers of such material.  In
2003, we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance with YEC, an ultracapacitor manufacturer headquartered in Taichung, Taiwan, with manufacturing and sales operations in mainland China. We entered into this alliance to accelerate
commercialization of our ultracapacitor products in China, and to utilize YECs production capabilities for assembly of certain Maxwell-branded ultracapacitor products. In 2006, we expanded our relationship with YEC to include supplying
ultracapacitor electrode material produced in our San Diego manufacturing facility to YEC for incorporation into its own line of ultracapacitor products, and to assist YEC in establishing worldwide distribution and marketing. 
High-Voltage Capacitors 
We produce our high-voltage grading and coupling capacitors in our Rossens, Switzerland facility. We believe we are the only high-voltage
capacitor producer that manufactures its products with stacking, assembly and automated winding processes. This enables us to produce consistent, high quality and highly reliable products, and gives us sufficient capacity to satisfy anticipated
global customer demand. Using advanced demand-based techniques, we upgraded the assembly portion of the process to a cell-based, just-in-time design in 2004, doubling our production capacity without adding direct labor, and
significantly shortening order-to-delivery intervals. This upgrade and subsequent capacity expansion also enabled us to manufacture products for the capacitive voltage divider market, which we did not previously serve. 
Radiation-Hardened Microelectronics Products  We produce our radiation-hardened microelectronics products in our San Diego production facility. We have reengineered our production processes for microelectronic products, resulting in substantial
reductions in cycle time and a significant increase in yield. This facility maintains the QML-V and QML-Q certifications, issued by the Department of Defense procurement agency.

Our microelectronics production operations include die characterization, packaging and
electrical, environmental and life testing. As a result of manufacturing cycle time reductions and operator productivity increases achieved over the past several years, we believe that this facility is capable of significantly increasing its current
output with minimal additional direct labor or capital expenditure, and therefore, that we have ample capacity to meet foreseeable demand in the space and satellite markets.  Suppliers  We generally purchase components and materials, such as carbon
powder, electronic components, dielectric materials and ceramic insulators from a number of suppliers. For certain products, such as our radiation-hardened microelectronic products and our high-voltage capacitors, we rely on a limited number of
suppliers or a single supplier. Although we believe there are alternative sources for some of the components and materials that we currently obtain from a single source, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify
alternative suppliers in a timely manner. Therefore, in critical component areas, we bank, or store, critical high value materials, especially silicon die. We are working to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers
through an extensive global sourcing effort.  Marketing and Sales 
We market and sell our products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales for integration by OEM customers into a wide range of end
products. Because the introduction of products based on emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and unfamiliar technical approaches, and because many OEM customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes, the design-in process
and initial sale of our products often takes months or even years.  Our principal marketing strategy is to identify
applications for which our products and technology offer a competitive value proposition, to become a preferred vendor on the basis of service and price, and to negotiate supply agreements that enable us to establish long-term relationships with key
OEM and integrator customers. As these design-in sales tend to be technical and engineering-intensive, we organize customer-specific teams composed of sales, applications engineering and other technical and operational personnel to work closely with
our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form, fit, function and environmental needs. As time-to-market often is a primary motivation for our customers to use our products, the initial sale and design-in process
typically evolves into ongoing account management to ensure on-time delivery, responsive technical support and problem-solving. 
We design and conduct discrete marketing programs intended to position and promote each of our product lines. These include trade shows,
seminars, advertising, product publicity, distribution of product literature, internet websites and social media. We employ marketing communications specialists and outside consultants to develop and implement our marketing programs,
design and develop marketing materials, negotiate advertising media purchases, write and place product press releases and manage our marketing websites.  We have an alliance with YEC to assemble and market small cell ultracapacitor products. In addition, we sell electrode material to YEC, both for Maxwell-branded products and for incorporation into
YECs own ultracapacitor products, and to Shanghai Sanjiu Electric Equipment Company, which has licensed our large cell architecture and has introduced its own brand of ultracapacitor products in China. 
Competition  Each of our
product lines has competitors, some of whom have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we have. In some of the target
markets for our emerging technologies, we face competition both from products utilizing well-established, existing technologies and other novel or emerging technologies.

Ultracapacitors  Our ultracapacitor products have two types of competitors: other ultracapacitor suppliers and purveyors of energy storage and power delivery solutions based on batteries or other technologies. Although a
number of companies are developing ultracapacitor products and technology, our principal competitors in the supply of ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products are Panasonic, a division of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., NessCap Co., Ltd.,
LS Mtron, a unit of LS Cable, and Groupe Bollore. In the supply of ultracapacitor electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers, our primary competitor is W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. The key competitive factors in the
ultracapacitor industry are price, performance (energy stored and power delivered per unit volume), durability and reliability, operational lifetime and overall breadth of product offerings. We believe that our ultracapacitor products and electrode
material compete favorably with respect to all of these competitive factors.  Ultracapacitors also compete with products based
on other technologies, including advanced batteries in power quality and peak power applications, and flywheels, thermal storage and batteries in back-up energy storage applications. We believe that ultracapacitors durability, long life,
performance and value give them a competitive advantage over these alternative choices in many applications. In addition, integration of ultracapacitors with some of these competing products may provide optimized solutions that neither product can
provide by itself. For example, Tier 1 auto parts supplier Continental AG designed a combined solution incorporating ultracapacitors with batteries for engine starting in a stop-start idle elimination system for micro hybrid autos that
was introduced by French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen in 2010, and has now been installed in more than 300,000 cars.  High-Voltage
Capacitors  Maxwell, through its acquisition in 2002 of Montena Components Ltd., now known as Maxwell
Technologies SA, and its CONDIS® line of high-voltage capacitor products, is the worlds largest producer
of high-voltage capacitors for use in electric utility infrastructure. Our principal competitors in the high-voltage capacitor markets are in-house production groups of certain of our customers and other independent manufacturers, such as the Coil
Product Division of Trench Limited in Canada and Europe and Hochspannungsgeräte Porz GmbH in Germany. We believe that we compete favorably, both as a consistent supplier of highly reliable high-voltage capacitors, and in terms of our expertise
in high-voltage systems design. Over the last ten years, our largest customer has transitioned from producing its grading and coupling capacitors internally to outsourcing substantially all of its requirements to us. 
Radiation-Hardened Microelectronic Products  Our radiation-hardened single-board computers and components compete with the products of traditional radiation-hardened integrated circuit suppliers such as Honeywell Corporation, Lockheed Martin
Corporation and BAE Systems. We also compete with commercial integrated circuit suppliers with product lines that have inherent radiation tolerance characteristics, such as National Semiconductor Corporation, Analog Devices Inc. and Temic
Instruments B.V. in Europe. Our proprietary radiation-hardened technologies enable us to provide flexible, high function, cost-competitive, radiation-hardened products based on the most advanced commercial electronic circuits and processors. In
addition, we compete with component product offerings from high reliability packaging houses such as Austin Semiconductor, Inc., Microsemi Corporation and Teledyne Microelectronics, a unit of Teledyne Technologies, Inc. 
Research and Development 
We maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and develop new products. For the year ended
December 31, 2011, our research and development expenditures totaled approximately $22.3 million, compared with $17.7 million and $16.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. In general, we
focus our research and product development activities on:   


 

 
 designing and producing products that perform reliably for the life of the end products or systems into which they are integrated;

  10 


Table of Contents


 

 
 making our products less expensive to produce so as to improve our profit margins and to enable us to reduce prices so that our products can penetrate
new, price-enabled applications;   


 

 
 designing our products to have superior technical performance; 
 


 

 
 designing our products to be compact and light; and   


 

 
 designing new products that provide novel solutions to expand our market opportunities. 
Most of our current research, development and engineering activities are focused on material science, including activated carbon,
electrolyte, electrically conducting and dielectric materials, ceramics and radiation-tolerant silicon and ceramic composites to reduce cost and improve performance, reliability and ease of manufacture. Additional efforts are focused on product
design and manufacturing engineering and manufacturing processes for high-volume manufacturing.  Ultracapacitors 
The principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power and energy density, reduce internal resistance,
extend operational life and reduce manufacturing cost. Our ultracapacitor designs focus on low-cost, high-capacity cells in standard sizes ranging from 1 to 3,000 farads, and corresponding multi-cell modules based on those form factors. 
High-voltage capacitors 
The principal focus of our high-voltage capacitor development efforts is to enhance performance and reliability while reducing the size,
weight and manufacturing cost of our products. We also are directing our design efforts to develop high-voltage capacitors for additional applications.  Microelectronic products  The principal focus of our microelectronics
product development activities is on circuit design, shielding and other radiation-hardening techniques that allow the use of powerful commercial silicon components in space and satellite applications that require ultra-high reliability. We also
focus on creating system solutions that overcome the basic failure mechanisms of individual components through architectural approaches, including redundancy, mitigation and correction. This involves expertise in system architecture, including
algorithm and microcode development, circuit design and the physics of radiation effects on silicon electronic components.  Intellectual
Property  We place a strong emphasis on inventing, protecting and exploiting proprietary technologies, processes and
designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. In an effort to assist in protecting this added value and uniqueness, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible
protection for those products and related technologies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing patents, secure additional patent protection in a manner that strengthens our overall patent portfolio and develop
new technologies, processes and designs not currently claimed by the patents of third parties. As of December 31, 2011, we held 87 issued U.S. patents and 22 pending U.S. patent applications which relate to our core technologies, processes and
designs. Of these issued patents, 55 relate to our ultracapacitor products and technology, five relate to our high voltage capacitor products and technology, and 27 relate to our microelectronics products and technology. Our subsidiary, PurePulse
Technologies, Inc. (PurePulse), which suspended operations in 2002, holds nine issued U.S. patents. Our issued patents have various expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2030. 
  11 


Table of Contents
Our pending patent applications and any future patent applications may not be allowed by the
specific patent offices around the world in which we are seeking patents on advanced technologies and products. We routinely seek to protect our new developments and technologies by applying for patents in jurisdictions in which we strive to obtain
a market advantage, including, most commonly, the United States and the principal countries of Europe and Asia. At present, with the exception of microcode architectures within our Radiation-hardened microelectronics product line, we do not rely on
licenses from any third parties to produce our products.  Our existing patent portfolios and pending patent applications
relate primarily to:  Ultracapacitors   


 

 
 compositions of the electrode, including its formulation, design and fabrication techniques; 
 


 

 
 physical cell package designs as well as the affiliated processes used in cell assembly; 
 


 

 
 cell-to-cell and module-to-module interconnect technologies that minimize equivalent series resistance and enhance the functionality, performance and
longevity of ultracapacitor products including system level electronics; and   


 

 
 module and system designs that facilitate applications of ultracapacitor technology. 
Microelectronics   


 

 
 system architectures that enable commercial silicon products to be used in radiation-intense space environments; 
 


 

 
 technologies and designs that improve packaging densities while mitigating the effect of radiation on commercial silicon; 
 


 

 
 radiation-mitigation techniques that improve performance while protecting sensitive commercial silicon from the effects of environmental radiation in
space; and   


 

 
 fault-tolerant computer systems with a plurality of processors which avoid deficiencies typically experienced by similar systems due to ionizing
radiation.  High Voltage Capacitors   


 

 
 manufacture of capacitors in a manner which significantly reduces exposure of internal components to impurities, moisture and other undesirable
materials in an effort to avoid longer manufacturing times and reduced performance characteristics without these technical advancements.  Historically, our high-voltage capacitor products have been based on our know-how and trade secrets rather than on patents. We filed our first patent application covering our high-voltage capacitor
technology in 2003, and we continue to pursue patent protection in addition to trade secret protection of certain aspects of our products design and production.  While our primary strategy for protecting our proprietary technologies, processes and designs is related to obtaining patents, we also apply for trademark registrations which identify the source of the
products with the Company. Additionally, we promote our technologies, processes and designs in association with these registered trademarks to further distinguish our products from those of our competitors. As of December 31, 2011, we have
eleven formal trademark registrations within the U.S.

Establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our
corporate strategy. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent infringement,
misappropriation or other misuse by third parties, or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. 
We use employee and third party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. We
require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all
rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment with us. In addition, we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties, such as potential product development
partners and customers, to protect any information disclosed in the pursuit of securing possible fruitful business endeavors.  Financial

Revenue from external customers located in countries included in All other countries do not individually compromise more than 10% of total revenues for any
of the years presented.  Risks Attendant to Foreign Operations and Dependence 
We have substantial operations in Switzerland, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside
the U.S. We expect our international sales to continue to represent a significant and increasing amount of our future revenues. As a result, our business will continue to be subject to certain risks, such as foreign government regulations, export
controls, changes in tax laws, tax treaties, tariffs and freight rates. Additionally, as a result of our extensive international operations and significant revenue generated outside the U.S., the dollar amount of our current and future revenues,
expenses and debt may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could impair our ability to achieve our targets for sales and profitability. 
Similarly, assets and liabilities of our Swiss subsidiary that are not denominated in its functional currency are subject to effects of
currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.  Having substantial international operations increases the
complexity of managing our financial reporting and internal controls and procedures. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to respond effectively to political, economic and other conditions in the countries where we operate and do business,
our results of 
  13 


Table of Contents

operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, changes in the mix of income from our domestic and foreign operations, expiration of tax holidays and changes
in tax laws and regulations could increase our tax expense.  As a result of our international operations, we are subject to
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, as well as the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. As
previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we conducted an internal review regarding payments made to our former independent sales agent in China with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our Swiss subsidiary. These
payments violated the FCPA. In January 2011, we settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) related to this matter. In addition to a monetary settlement, the Company will
periodically report to the SEC and DOJ on the Companys internal compliance program concerning anti-bribery.  Backlog 
Product backlog as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $31.5 million, compared with $21.3 million as of December 31, 2010.
Backlog consists of firm orders for products that will be delivered within 12 months.  Significant Customers 
There were no sales to one customer amounting to more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
Sales to one customer, ABB Ltd., amounted to approximately $9.7 million, or 10%, of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Government Regulation  Due to the nature of our operations and the use of
hazardous substances in some of our manufacturing and research and development activities, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing workplace safety and environmental protection. These
include the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes. In the course of our historical operations, materials or wastes may have spilled or been released from
properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials and wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and the materials and wastes spilled, released, or disposed thereon are subject to environmental laws
that may impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for remediation of contamination resulting from such releases. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remediate previously spilled,
released, or disposed substances or wastes, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations also could result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal
penalties and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities. It is also possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as
well as the industry in general. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that we will not incur substantial costs in the future. 
In addition, certain of our microelectronics products are subject to International Traffic in Arms export regulations when they are sold
to customers outside the U.S. We routinely obtain export licenses for such product shipments outside the U.S.  Employees 
As of December 31, 2011, we had 435 employees in five countries, as follows: 215 full-time, one part-time and 65
temporary employees in the U.S., 104 full-time, 15 part-time and nine temporary employees in Switzerland, 21 full-time employees in China, four full-time employees in Germany, and one full-time employee

in the United Kingdom. We are unable to estimate the percent of our Swiss employees that are members of a labor union, as Swiss law prohibits employers from inquiring into the union status of
employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Available Information 
We file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Our SEC filings are available free of charge to the public over the Internet at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available free of charge on our website
at http://www.maxwell.com as soon as reasonably practicable following the time that they are filed with the SEC. You may also read and copy any document we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street,
NW, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The information found on our website is not part of this or any report that we file with the SEC. 
Facilities  We have
ongoing operations in San Diego, California and Rossens, Switzerland and are in the process of opening a production facility in Peoria, Arizona. In San Diego, we occupy a 45,000 square foot facility for research and manufacturing operations under a
renewable lease that expires in July 2015. We occupy an 11,864 square foot facility located in San Diego for our corporate offices under a renewable lease expiring in July 2015. In addition, we have a 36,367 square foot facility in San Diego for our
principle research and marketing operations under a renewable lease that expires December 2018. Our Peoria Arizona facility occupies 123,048 square feet under a renewable lease that expires in June 2022 and we have two additional five year options
thereafter. We also lease research, manufacturing and marketing facilities in Rossens, Switzerland, occupying 60,762 square feet, under a renewable lease that expires in December 2019 and we have two additional five year options thereafter. We also
have small sales offices in Shanghai, China; Gilching, Germany; and Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom, under lease arrangements. We believe that we have sufficient space to support forecasted increases in production volume and, that our facilities are
adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors  An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if potentially adverse developments, some of which are described below, materialize and cannot be
resolved successfully. In any such case, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, may also
result in decreased revenues, increased expenses or other adverse impacts that could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our
consolidated financial statements and the related notes.  Our business is subject to unique risks related to its international
operations including the risk that we will be unable to adequately comply with the changing rules and regulations in countries where our business is conducted.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations. Such operations outside the U.S. are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in
currency values and foreign currency exchange rates, import and export requirements and trade policy, anti-corruption laws, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data
privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Compliance with these U.S. and foreign laws
and regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and these costs may continue to increase in the future as a result of changes in such laws and regulations or in their interpretation. Furthermore, we have implemented
policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Any such violations could
individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.  Our success could be negatively
impacted if we fail to control, oversee and direct foreign subsidiaries and their operations.  We currently own foreign
subsidiaries located within Europe and China where the employees and cultures represent certain vast differences from employees and cultures within the United States where our corporate headquarters is situated. While the cultural values and
philosophies of the people located in Europe are generally viewed to be in alignment with that of U.S. persons, there are still some significant differences. For example, the respective European data privacy laws take a harsher position regarding
the protection of employee personal data and, consequently, there is less information shared with the U.S. parent corporation regarding employees working for our European subsidiaries. Additionally, the human resources and the systems our foreign
entities use can represent vast differences, notably, our Swiss subsidiary and Shanghai subsidiary utilize a primary language other than English for communications.  Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from international operations could harm our financial condition and operating results. 
Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe as well as
non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and
generally will lead us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, we may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent to offset unfavorable
exchange rate fluctuations, or at all, 
  16 


Table of Contents

which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to our
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause us to realize a reduction in our overall gross margin as the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated expenses increases. 
Our business activities are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery laws, as well as the
restrictions agreed to in our respective settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ). If we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws and regulations or the terms of either
settlement agreement, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties as well as further expenses related to an additional internal investigation.  Due to our status as a U.S. issuer, we are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. During 2009
and 2010, we conducted an internal review into the nature of certain payments made to an independent third party sales agent in China with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA.
 According to court documents, Maxwell SA, engaged a Chinese agent to sell products in China, and from at least July 2002
through May 2009, paid more than $2.5 million to this agent to secure contracts with Chinese customers. The agent in turn used Maxwell SAs money to influence officials at state-owned entities in connection with sales contracts. In its books
and records, the Company mischaracterized the payments as sales-commission expenses.  In January 2011, we reached settlements
with the SEC and DOJ with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to this matter. We settled civil charges with the SEC, agreeing to an injunction against further violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement with the
SEC, we will pay a total of $6.4 million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest, in two installments, with $3.2 paid in each of the first quarters of 2011 and 2012. Under the terms of the settlement with the DOJ, we will pay a total of $8.0
million in penalties in three installments, with $3.5 million paid in the first quarter of 2011, 2.3 million paid in the first quarter of 2012, and $2.3 million payable in the first quarter of 2013. As part of the settlement, we entered into a
three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ. If we remain in compliance with the terms of the DPA, at the conclusion of the term, the charges against us brought by the DOJ will be dismissed with prejudice. Further, under
the terms of the agreements, we will periodically report to the SEC and DOJ on our internal compliance program concerning anti-bribery.  Our failure to comply with any terms or conditions of the respective settlement agreements, including, notably, payment obligations or ongoing compliance obligations, could result in additional criminal
and/or civil penalties as well as continued expenses related to additional investigations and defense costs for addressing such a default. 
We depend upon component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.
 Substantially all of our components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers.
Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., but are concentrated in a few general locations. We have also outsourced much of our transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also
reduce our direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control could have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of our products, or our flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In addition, we rely on third-party
manufacturers to adhere to the terms and conditions of the agreements in place with each party. For example, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, we may remain responsible to the
customer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect our reputation, financial
condition and operating results.

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, we must introduce and commercialize new products
successfully as well as adequately educate our prospective customers on the products we offer.  Our ability to compete
successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. We believe that we are unique in that we are the technology leader for the technologies we
deliver and typically must first educate the customer regarding the implementation of our solution in their systems before the customer is capable of designing in our products. As a result, we must make significant investments in research and
development efforts as well as sales and marketing efforts, including applications engineering resources. By contrast, many of our competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If we are unable to
continue to develop and sell innovative new products or if we are unable to effectively educate the prospective customer on the value proposition offered by the implementation of our products, then our ability to maintain a competitive advantage
could be negatively affected and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  The successful management of
new market applications and new product introductions will be necessary for our growth.  Given our position as the
technology leader for the products and solutions we offer, there are a considerable number of new product concepts in the pipeline. Our ability to effectively accurately determine which new products or applications to pursue and which products to
abandon will be necessary for us to meet our growth targets and remain competitive within the markets into which we sell our products. There are a number of reasons why a new product concept or market application may be abandoned, including greater
than anticipated development costs, technical difficulties, regulatory obstacles, competition, inability to prove the original concept, lack of demand or acceptance, and the need to divert focus, from time to time, to other initiatives with
perceived opportunities for better returns. Commercial success frequently depends on being the first provider of the technology to the market, and many of our competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new energy storage
technology. Consequently, if we are not able to fund our research and development activities appropriately and deliver new products to the markets we serve on a timely basis, our growth and operations will be harmed. Additionally, as the market
leader for the technology markets in which we practice, competitors follow us closely and follow our lead thereby requiring us to move on to the next innovation quickly enough to continue to serve as the market leader for technology. 
Competition in the energy storage domain has significantly affected, and will continue to affect, our sales. 
Many companies are engaged in or are starting to engage in designing, developing and producing energy storage solutions as a consequence
of the push for clean energy solutions, including, most notably, government funding opportunities associated with pursuing such clean energy solutions. Consequently, more companies are pursuing opportunities in the energy storage domain and such new
parties are entering the markets in which we currently do business as competitors. The success of these new competitors could render our existing products less competitive, resulting in reduced sales compared to our expectations or past results. For
example, significant amounts of U.S. government funds are being invested in development of batteries with better performance characteristics or lower manufacturing costs than battery technologies currently on the market. An increasing number of
parties are submitting proposals for and receiving this government funding and, consequently, these new better-performing batteries that include power delivery functionality could compete for market share with our existing ultracapacitor products.
 Our success depends largely on the acquisition of, as well as the continued availability and service of, key personnel. 
Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our senior executive management
team as well as highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Due to the complexity and immaturity of the technologies involved in the product we produce and the 
  18 


Table of Contents

markets we serve, we may be unable to find the right personnel with the background needed to serve our goals and objectives. As the market leader for the technologies we develop, there are
limited opportunities to hire personnel from competitors or from companies who have worked closely with similar or identical technology. Consequently, we seek to hire individuals who are capable of performing in an environment where they are
expected to create with limited resources and references to past experiences. We may struggle to find such gifted personnel who also thrive in a high growth business atmosphere and who are capable of keeping pace with the fast environment encouraged
by the technologies we create and the markets we serve. These uniquely talented personnel are in high demand in the technology industry and competition for acquiring such individuals is intense. Some of our scientists and engineers are the key
developers of our products and technologies and are recognized as leaders in their area of expertise. Without first attracting the personnel with the appropriate baseline skill sets and then retaining such personnel, we could fail to maintain our
technological and competitive advantage.  Our inability to manage rapid growth in personnel, including development and training of such
personnel in an immature industry, as well as to map out succession planning, could impede our success.  Our business has
grown rapidly. This growth has placed, and any future growth would continue to place, a significant strain on our limited personnel, management and other resources. Also, due to the learning curve associated with the immature products and services
provided by us and the anticipated rapid growth of our product demands and revenues, we face risks related to managing personnel in such a growth environment. We may fail to accurately gauge the growth in personnel required at the appropriate time
without incurring the additional cost and expense of the additional personnel before they are needed. We will also need to determine how to best add this new talent and transfer information and know-how without sacrificing the ongoing demands of the
business. For example, each new hire will need to learn quickly about our products and technologies. Since there is limited information available in the public domain, this information will need to be passed from existing personnel to new personnel
all while the existing personnel continue to complete their ongoing job duties. Additionally, our ability to grow management talent below the senior executive level will be imperative to achieving our goals. In a smaller organization, the senior
executive management team is capable of handling and being involved in several tasks and decision making forums. However, once the Company makes significant progress toward meeting its growth targets, the time constraints will be felt more severely
by the senior executive team and some of the tasks they are currently capable of handling on their own will need to be transferred to the management team reporting to them. Accordingly, growing the next level of management and identifying key
personnel for succession planning will become critical to our ongoing success.  Our success as a reliable supplier to our customers is
highly dependent upon our ability to effectively manage our reliance upon certain suppliers of key component parts and specialty equipment.  Because we currently obtain certain key components including, but not limited to carbon, binder, separator, paper, aluminum piece parts, die, printed circuit boards and certain finished goods from single
or limited sources, we are subject to significant supply and pricing risks. If the particular supplier is unable to provide the appropriate quantity and/or quality of the raw material at the prices required, then we will be unable to produce and
deliver our finished goods to customers thereby losing out on revenue generation and, potentially, incurring penalties for failing to timely perform. Additionally, we use some custom components that are not common to the rest of the industries
served by our suppliers and which are often available from only one source. Also, when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the particular suppliers yield has matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet our unique
requirements. If the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of
completed products to us, then our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
  19 


Table of Contents
Conversely, diversifying our supplier base to ensure that we have multiple suppliers for
each key raw material typically involves additional costs including, but not limited to: higher prices for the raw materials as a direct consequence of purchasing lower volumes from each supplier; additional costs associated with qualifying
additional suppliers; and increased resource expense in managing an additional supplier for factors including quality, timely delivery and other standards. If we fail to balance the interests between the reliance upon a single supplier and expense
associated with diversifying the supply chain base, then our actual gross profit could fail to meet our targets.  Our products and services
may experience quality problems from time to time that could result in decreased sales and operating margin.  In the case
of our ultracapacitor products, we sell relatively new technology which could contain defects in design and manufacture. As a direct consequence of the immaturity of this technology, we are still learning about the technology and its potential
quality issues which could arise during operation. Additionally, we are still learning, along with our customers, how the products will operate in the systems into which our customers are incorporating the products. Consequently, we are not always
capable of anticipating the defects or quality problems the products are likely to experience in the field. Products sold into high performance environments such as heavy transportation and automotive markets could experience additional operating
characteristics that could unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of our products. With this sometimes limited understanding of the applicability and operation of our products in varying end user applications, we also strive to respond
quickly in modifying the products to accommodate such concerns. As such, the release time of next generation products is relatively short thereby forcing us to assume additional risks associated with expediting the release of new or modified
products. We are also building our infrastructure to adequately and efficiently handle any potential recall and the reverse logistics involved in returning our products to our facilities in the event that any defects are found. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the products we sell or will be able to efficiently handle all issues related to product returns. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to our reputation, and significant
warranty and other expenses, and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.  Efforts to protect our
intellectual property rights and to defend claims against us could increase our costs and will not always succeed; any failures could adversely affect sales and profitability and restrict our ability to do business. 
Intellectual property (IP) rights are crucial to our business, particularly for our ultracapacitor and microelectronics
product lines. We endeavor to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights which we feel will allow us to obtain or maintain our competitive advantage in the marketplace. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately
identify and protect the portions of IP which are strategic to our business. When strategic intellectual property rights are identified, then we will seek formal protection in jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used, jurisdictions
in which competitors are producing or importing their products, and jurisdictions into which our products are imported. Different nations may provide limited rights and inconsistent duration of protection for our products. Additionally, we may be
unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions. For example, the patent prosecution and enforcement system within China is less mature than the systems in other jurisdictions and therefore we may be less able to
enforce our rights.  Even if protection is obtained, competitors or others in the chain of commerce may raise legal challenges
to our rights or illegally infringe our rights, including through means that may be difficult to prevent or detect. For example, a certain portion of our IP portfolio is related to unique process steps performed during the manufacture of our
products and which are not readily recognizable in the physical embodiment of the final product. It may be difficult to identify and prove that a competitor is infringing on our rights to such process steps. Further, we are required to divulge
certain of our IP to our business partners to enable them to provide quality product or raw materials to us in order for us to accomplish our business goals. To the extent that such disclosure occurs in

  20 


Table of Contents

China or other jurisdictions in which the ability to protect IP is more limited, we may begin to lose our competitive edge. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technology advancements, and
the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions, competitors may be issued patents stemming from pending patent applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance. These patents could reduce the value of our commercial or
pipeline products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require that we seek to obtain a license or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to our business. We may not be able to obtain such a
license on acceptable terms. The extent to which we succeed or fail in our efforts to protect our intellectual property will affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Our inability to effectively identify, enter into, manage and benefit from strategic alliances, may limit our ability to pursue certain growth objectives and/or strategies. 
Our reputation is important to our growth and success. As a leader in an emerging technology industry, we recognize the value in
identifying, selecting and managing key strategic alliances. We are mainly focusing our business on the specific products we deliver and pursuit of strategic alliances with other companies could allow us to provide customers with integrated or other
new products and services derived from the alliances. To be successful, we must first be able to define and identify opportunities which align with our growth plan. Additionally, we cannot be certain that our alliance partners will provide us with
the support we anticipate, that such alliance or other relationships will be successful in developing our technology for use with their intended products, or that any alliances or other relationships will be successful in manufacturing and marketing
integrated products. Our success is also highly dependent upon our ability to manage the respective parameters of all strategic alliances, promote the benefits to us, and to not prohibit or discourage other opportunities which may be beneficial to
us in the future. Also, certain provisions of alliance agreements that are for our benefit may be subject to restrictions of foreign laws that limit our ability to enforce such contractual provisions. Currently, we have alliances with several
partners both in the U.S. and throughout the world. We anticipate that future alliances may also be with foreign partners or entities. As a result, such future alliances may be subject to the political climate and economies of the foreign countries
where such partners reside and operate. If the strategic alliances we pursue are not successful, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.  Should a catastrophic event or other significant business interruption occur at any of our facilities, we could face significant reconstruction or remediation costs, penalties, third party liability
and loss of production capacity, which could affect our business.  Weather conditions, natural disasters or other
catastrophic events could cause significant disruptions in operations. In turn, the quality, cost and volumes of the products we are able to produce and sell will be affected, which will affect our sales and profitability. Natural disasters or
industrial accidents could also damage our manufacturing facilities or infrastructure, or those of our major suppliers or major customers, which could affect our costs and our ability to meet supply. For example, currently, our sole manufacturing
facilities for electrode and microelectronics are located in San Diego, California, an area known for natural wildfires and earthquakes. However, we are in the process of opening a second manufacturing facility for electrode in Peoria, Arizona,
which will provide for an alternative manufacturing location in the event we are impacted by a catastrophic event or other significant business interruption at one of our manufacturing locations. Weather conditions, natural disasters or industrial
accidents could also affect our manufacturing facilities, or those of our major suppliers or major customers, which could affect our costs and our ability to deliver products, or could reduce demand. 
War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or
disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing partners and customers. Our business operations are subject to interruption by power
shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to produce and deliver
products to our customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from our suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, we could be negatively
affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the 
  21 


Table of Contents

movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. The majority of our
research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing partners, are in locations that could be affected by
natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, losses could be incurred and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. While we
may purchase insurance policies to cover the direct economic impact experienced following such a natural disaster, there can no assurance that such insurance policy will cover the full extent of our financial loss nor will it cover losses which are
not economic in nature such as, for example only, our business and reputation as a reliable supplier.  We may be subject to information
technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.  Information technology system failures,
network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions or reporting of financial results, or
causing the unintentional disclosure of confidential information of our own or of our customers. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security, certain data and system redundancy and internal control
measures, there can be no assurance that the measures we have implemented to date would be sufficient in the event of a system failure, loss of data or security breach. As a result, in the event of such an event or failure, our financial condition
and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our ability to match our production plans for our ultracapacitor products to the level
of product actually demanded by customers has a significant effect on our sales, costs and growth potential. 
Customers decisions are affected by market, economic and government regulation conditions which can be difficult to accurately gauge
in advance. Failure to provide customers and channel partners with demanded quantities of our products could reduce our sales. Conversely, increased capacity which exceeds actual customer demands for our products increases our costs and,
consequently, reduces our profit margins on the products delivered. Although we have implemented policies and procedures for refining the forecasting methods used by customers and a more sophisticated mechanism for gauging the sales pipeline to
better project timing of new customer demand, there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will match our production plans with customer demands. Additionally, we are continuing to develop new and improved products, which may require the
implementation of new manufacturing processes and equipment lines. As a result of all of these factors, we could fail to meet either revenue or profit margin targets.  A substantial percentage of our total revenue depends on the sale of products within a small number of vertical markets and a small number of geographic regions, and the decline in the size of a
vertical market or reduction of consumption within a geographic region, could impede our growth and profitability.  Sales
within a relatively small number of vertical markets and a small number of geographic regions, make up a large portion of our revenues. Our ability to grow our sales within this limited number of markets and regions depends on our ability to compete
on price, delivery and quality. For example, our microelectronics products are primarily used within the space industries. Within the space community there are a limited number of customers for our products and each customer represents a significant
portion of our revenue. If our relationships with such large customers are disrupted, we could lose a significant portion of our anticipated revenue. Factors that could influence our relationships with our customers include: our ability to sell our
products at prices that are competitive with competing suppliers; our ability to maintain features and quality standards for our products sufficient to meet the expectations of our customers; our ability to produce and deliver a sufficient quantity
of our products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements; and our financial condition and perceived viability as a long term supplier. Similarly, we currently sell our products into a small number of

  22 


Table of Contents

vertical markets. If a particular market into which we sell experiences a decline, then our customers will decrease their own consumption of our products thereby reducing our revenues. For
example, if consumers are no longer accepting of the use of solid state disc drives within their computers, then our direct customers will no longer consume products from us for incorporation into such solid state disc drives. Additionally, as we
continue to pursue sales of our products into markets which traditionally have lower margin rates than our current business, for example, the automotive and consumer markets, we may be forced to reduce our margins to remain competitive in these
markets. If we continue to pursue these markets and reduce our margins to increase sales, then we could experience degradation in our overall profit margins. Finally, a substantial portion of our revenues stem from sales to customers within a
limited number of geographic regions including, notably, China and Germany. Collectively, almost half of our revenues are from customers situated in China or Germany. If certain factors were to arise including, for example, a catastrophic event or
shift in economic health and stability within a particular region, then customers within these regions may reduce their consumption of our products resulting in reduced revenues for us.  Many of our customers are currently the benefactors of government funding or government subsidies.  Our products are currently sold into a limited number of vertical markets which are either directly funded by or partially subsidized with government funding in the respective markets where our customers
exist. Our ultracapacitor products provide numerous technology and environmental benefits for many of the applications in which our customers are using these products. As the technology utilized for these devices is still relatively immature, the
costs associated with producing the products is high as compared with the current solution used by customers today. However, many government entities have determined that they view certain prevailing interests, including, for example, reduction of
pollution, to outweigh the costs associated with incorporating these clean technologies and therefore are willing to allocate government funding to encourage companies, including our customers, to spend additional money to produce goods which reduce
pollution or energy consumption. If the government entities elect to change their policy on government subsidies or decide to cancel certain government funding programs, then our customers could cancel or reduce orders for our products. Similarly,
our microelectronics and high voltage capacitor products are consumed by markets which are either directly funded by or controlled by the respective government bodies in the jurisdictions where our customers do business. For example, our
microelectronics products are used in the space community which is ultimately run by the space agencies of the governments where we do business. Likewise, our high voltage capacitor products are largely used for electric utility infrastructures
which are largely controlled by the respective governments supplying power and electricity to its populations.  We may not be able to
obtain sufficient capital to meet our operating or other needs, which could require us to change our business strategy and result in decreased profitability and a loss of customers. Namely, if we fail to meet the debt covenants imposed by our credit
facility, we could lose access to that credit facility.  We believe that in the future we will need a substantial amount of
additional capital for a number of potential purposes, including the following:   


 

 
 to meet potential production volumes for our products, particularly our ultracapacitors, which may require customized production lines to achieve
targeted customer volume and price requirements;   


 

 
 to expand our manufacturing capabilities and develop viable outsourcing opportunities and other production alternatives; 
 


 

 
 to fund our continuing expansion into commercial markets and compete effectively in those markets; 
 


 

 
 to develop new technology and cost effective solutions in our business; and 
 


 

 
 to acquire new or complementary businesses, product lines or technologies.

In December 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo (Credit
Agreement) which grants us a line of credit and equipment term loan facility, as long as we remain in compliance with various terms and conditions. These term and conditions include certain restrictions and financial covenants, and it is
uncertain whether we will be able to meet such financial covenants over the term of the Credit Agreement. If we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, then the line of credit may be withdrawn, we may be required to
immediately repay any outstanding obligation, and the additional funds will not be available to us to fund our growth.  In
addition, in April 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $125 million of our common stock, warrants or debt securities. In August 2011,
the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which will allow us to access the capital markets for the three year period following this effective date.  There can be no assurance that these additional sources of financing will ultimately be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we may be required
to change or delay our planned growth, which could result in decreased revenues, profits and loss of customers. Also, the issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our current stockholders. If additional financing is accomplished by
the issuance of debt, the service cost, or interest, will reduce net income or increase net loss, and we may also be required to issue warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with issuing such debt. 
The issuance of shares of our common stock could result in the loss of our ability to use our net operating losses. 
As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $268 million of U.S. federal tax and state tax net operating loss carryforwards.
Realization of any benefit from our tax net operating losses is dependent on: 1) our ability to generate future taxable income and 2) the absence of certain future ownership changes to our common stock. An ownership change,
as defined in the applicable federal income tax rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income we may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the
net operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate our ability to use a substantial portion of our net operating losses to offset any future taxable income. The issuance of shares of our common stock could cause an ownership
change. Such transactions include the issuance of shares of common stock upon future conversion or exercise of outstanding options. 
Our stock price continues to be volatile.  Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors, including but not limited to variations between our actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by
us or our competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may
have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. Furthermore, we believe our stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If we fail to meet these expectations then our stock price may significantly
decline which could have an adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.  Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could
materially adversely affect us.  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the
ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to
our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. From time to time, we are involved in major lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative proceedings and
other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes 
  24 


Table of Contents

of which may be significant to our results of operations or limit our ability to engage in our business activities. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into material settlements
to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary
damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business and materially affect our financial condition and operating results. While we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover any
liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. We have recorded reserves for potential liabilities where we believe the liability to be probable and reasonably estimable. However, our actual costs may be materially different from this estimate.
 Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent certain transactions and could make a takeover more
difficult.  Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. We have a classified board of directors, which means that our directors are divided into three classes that are elected to three-year terms on a
staggered basis. Since the three year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors, the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year. Furthermore, our certificate of incorporation contains a fair
price provision which may require a potential acquirer to obtain the consent of our board to any business combination involving us.  The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, deter or prevent a merger, tender offer, or other business combination or change in control involving us that stockholders might
consider to be in their best interests. This includes offers or attempted takeovers that could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock.

Properties  We have
ongoing operations in San Diego, California and Rossens, Switzerland and are in the process of opening a production facility in Peoria, Arizona. In San Diego, we occupy a 45,000 square foot facility for research and manufacturing operations under a
renewable lease that expires in July 2015. We occupy an 11,864 square foot facility located in San Diego for our corporate offices under a renewable lease expiring in July 2015. In addition, we have a 36,367 square foot facility in San Diego for our
principle research and marketing operations under a renewable lease that expires December 2018. Our Peoria Arizona facility occupies 123,048 square feet under a renewable lease that expires in June 2022 and we have two additional five year options
thereafter. Further, we lease research, manufacturing and marketing facilities in Rossens, Switzerland, occupying 60,762 square feet, under a renewable lease that expires in December 2019 and we have two additional five year options thereafter. We
also have small sales offices in Shanghai, China; Gilching, Germany; and Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom, under lease arrangements. We believe that we have sufficient space to support forecasted increases in production volume and, that our facilities
are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.  Over the past several years, we have made substantial capital
investments to outfit and expand our internal production facilities and incorporate mechanization and automation techniques and processes. Additionally, we have trained our manufacturing personnel in the necessary operational techniques. With the
completion of certain upgrades and expansions in recent years, and other upgrades and capacity expansions currently underway, along with our contract manufacturing relationships with Belton Technology Group and Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co.
Ltd. in China, we believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand for all of our product lines.

Legal Proceedings  Customer Claim
 In 2005, a customer claimed a possible defect in a product that was produced for our Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA,
under contract by a third party manufacturer, Epcos AG, and resold to the customer. In July 2011, we reached an agreement in principal with the customer to settle any and all claims for consideration of 1.8 million Euro (approximately $2.3
million as of December 31, 2011), with 500,000 Euro (approximately $648,000 as of December 31, 2011) payable to the customer up front and the remaining amount of 1.3 million Euro (approximately $1.7 million as of December 31,
2011) available to the customer as a specified discount on future purchases of our products. Any balance remaining of the 1.3 million Euro not used as product discount by December 31, 2014 is payable in cash at that time. This agreement is
not yet final, and is therefore subject to change until a written agreement between the parties is executed. We are continuing to pursue recovery of damages from the manufacturer of the defective product, but at this time we are unable to ascertain
the amount of the recovery, if any. The anticipated settlement amount of 1.8 million Euro (approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2011) due from us to the customer has been fully accrued in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.  FCPA Matter 
As a result of being a publicly traded company in the U.S., we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),
which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Beginning in 2009, we conducted an internal review into payments made to our former independent sales agent in China with
respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our Swiss subsidiary. In January 2011, we reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ
relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the FCPA and other securities law violations. We settled civil charges with the SEC, agreeing to an injunction against further violations of the FCPA.
Under the terms of the settlement with the SEC, we agreed to pay a total of $6.4 million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest, in two installments, with $3.2 million paid in each of the first quarters of 2011 and 2012. Under the terms of
the settlement with the DOJ, we agreed to pay a total of $8.0 million in penalties in three installments, with $3.5 million paid in the first quarter of 2011, $2.3 million paid in the first quarter of 2012, and $2.3 million payable in the first
quarter of 2013. As part of the settlement, we entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ. If we remain in compliance with the terms of the DPA, at the conclusion of the term, the charges against us
asserted by the DOJ will be dismissed with prejudice. Further, under the terms of the agreements, we will periodically report to the SEC and DOJ on our internal compliance program concerning anti-bribery. As of December 31, 2011, $5.4 million
is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $2.3 million is included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  Shareholder Derivative Suit  In August 2010 and September 2010, two
separate shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Superior Court for San Diego County, California, on behalf of and for the benefit of us, against certain of our current and former officers and directors alleging, among other claims, breach
of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. In October 2010, these two actions were consolidated, and in March 2011 a consolidated and amended shareholder derivative complaint was filed bringing similar claims as the
previous complaints. The consolidated and amended complaint was titled Loizides v. Schramm et al. and alleged that the individual defendants failed to prevent us from violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and failed to
maintain internal controls and accounting systems for compliance with the FCPA. On December 15, 2011, all parties attended mediation, wherein at the conclusion of the hearing the mediator proposed a settlement amount of $3.0 million to be paid
to plaintiffs counsels, with $2.7 million to be paid by our insurance carrier and $290,000 to be paid by us. In addition to the monetary amount and as part of the proposed settlement, we would be required to ensure that certain corporate
governance measures are in place and enforced. On February 8, 2012, 
  26

the Board of Directors of the Company approved these settlement terms. The agreement is subject to, among other things, court approval and notice to our shareholders. On February 9, 2012,
the parties executed a stipulation of settlement, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for court approval of the settlement. On February 14, 2012, the court entered an order that preliminarily approved the proposed settlement, subject to further
consideration at a settlement hearing scheduled for April 12, 2012, which will likely result in a dismissal of the consolidated derivative action with prejudice. As of December 31, 2011, we have accrued a liability of $3.0 million based on the
anticipated settlement amount, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a receivable of $2.7 million, which is included in trade and other accounts receivable, for the amount payable by our insurance
carrier.  Customer Bankruptcy Matter  In January 2011, we attended a bankruptcy proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California for a previous customer, ISE Corp., in order to bid on certain
intellectual property and physical assets that were being auctioned. During this proceeding, an offer for sale was presented for any and all potential claims held by the previous customer against us. These potential claims related primarily to
payments made to us prior to the previous customer filing bankruptcy, as well as a potential intellectual property dispute between us and the previous customer. At the January 2011 bankruptcy proceeding, we bid $250,000 to purchase the right to any
and all future claims against us stemming from rights held by the previous customer. However, following the auction, the previous customer essentially declined the previous offer for settlement with us. Since this time, in the interest of a more
expedient resolution to this matter, we have increased our settlement offer to $500,000. Recently, the parties have been unable to progress with settlement discussions until other matters with the previous customers estate are resolved with
third parties. We believe that we have strong legal defenses against any and all potential claims related to this matter, and do not believe a settlement amount in excess of $500,000 is likely. Our current estimate of the range of loss on this
matter is $500,000 to $1,000,000, with the low end of this range based on our outstanding settlement offer, and the high end of the range based on the opposing partys counter offer of $871,000, which only represented the preference payment
claim, plus some amount for the intellectual property dispute. The proposed settlement amount of $500,000 has been fully accrued in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.
 DCIS Matter  In 2007, we delivered products to two separate customers who were incorporating our products into larger systems for use by agencies of the U.S. government. In 2008, one of these customers reported
intermittent failures in the products delivered to it by us and replacement units were provided to that customer. In March 2010, we were contacted by an agent from the Defense Criminal Investigative Services (DCIS) requesting a meeting
to discuss the failures that occurred with our products delivered to a specific customer. In April 2011, the DCIS agent contacted us again to request a follow up meeting to ask additional questions. Essentially, we believe that the DCIS agent is
considering the appropriateness of our actions regarding the discovered product failures and whether the failure reported by this particular customer would be applicable to another customer to which the same products were delivered. In June 2011,
the DCIS served a subpoena on us requesting that we produce certain documents. In December 2011, we completed our production of documents requested under the subpoena. To date, no formal actions have been taken by DCIS with respect to any documents
provided by us. Further, we have not identified any documents or facts that appear to indicate any wrongdoing, including, potentially, any violation of laws or regulations. At this time, we believe it is remote that we will incur any penalties,
fines or other monetary settlements as a result of this matter, and as such have not accrued any amount associated with this matter. However, given the passage of time on this matter and the indeterminate amount of time that this matter could remain
open, we have determined that there is a reasonable possibility that this matter could have a material impact on our financial condition. However, based on the stage of this matter, we are unable to estimate a range of loss.

 Outlook  Executive
Overview  Maxwell is a global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing advanced energy storage and power delivery
products for transportation, industrial, information technology and other applications, and microelectronic products for space and satellite applications. Our strategy is to establish a compelling value proposition for our products by designing and
manufacturing them to perform reliably with minimal maintenance over long operational lifetimes. We have three product lines: ultracapacitors with applications in multiple industries, including transportation, automotive, information technology,
renewable energy and consumer and industrial electronics; high-voltage capacitors primarily applied in electrical utility infrastructure; and radiation-hardened microelectronic products for space and satellite applications. 
Our primary objective is to grow revenue and profit margins by creating and satisfying demand for our ultracapacitor-based energy storage
and power delivery solutions. We are focusing on establishing and expanding market opportunities for ultracapacitors and being the preferred supplier for ultracapacitor products worldwide. We believe that the transportation industry represents the
largest market opportunity for ultracapacitors, primarily for applications related to engine starting, electrical system augmentation, and braking energy recuperation and hybrid electric drive systems for transit buses, trucks and autos, and
electric rail vehicles. Various backup power applications, including instantly available power for uninterruptible power supply and wind turbine blade pitch systems, also represent a significant market opportunity. 
We also seek to expand market opportunities for our high-voltage capacitor and radiation-hardened microelectronic products. The market
for high-voltage capacitors consists mainly of expansion, upgrading and 
  31

maintenance of existing electrical utility infrastructure and new infrastructure installations in developing countries. Such installations are capital-intensive and frequently are subject to
regulation, availability of government funding and general economic conditions. Although the market for microelectronics products for space and satellite applications is relatively small, the specialized nature of these products and the requirement
for failure-free reliability allows us the opportunity to generate profit margins significantly higher than those for commodity electronic components.  In 2011, revenues were $157.3 million, representing an increase of 29% compared with 2010. This revenue growth is primarily attributable to increased ultracapacitor product sales, which grew in 2011 by
42% compared with 2010. Further, overall gross profit in 2011 was 39%, compared with 38% in 2010. The increase in gross margin was driven mainly by significantly improved profitability for our ultracapacitor products related to increased sales
volume and reduced manufacturing costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $29.3 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. However, in the future, we may
decide to supplement planned cash flow provided from operations by issuing debt or equity.  Going forward, we will continue to
focus on growing our business and strengthening our market leadership and brand recognition through further penetration of existing markets, entry into new markets and development of new products. Our primary focus will be to grow our ultracapacitor
business through continued market penetration in primary applications, including automotive, transportation and backup power. In order to achieve our growth objectives, we will need to overcome risks and challenges facing our business. Significant
risks and challenges we face include the ability to maintain profitability; the ability to develop our management team, product development infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to facilitate growth; competing technologies that may capture
market share and interfere with our planned growth; and hiring, developing and retaining key personnel critical to the execution of our strategy. We will be attentive to these risks and will focus on achieving higher profits, and on developing new
products and promoting the value proposition of our products over competing technologies. In addition, we are augmenting current manufacturing capacity and infrastructure, which we believe will be sufficient to accommodate our planned growth. We
believe that the Company is well positioned to sustain the financial and operational progress exhibited by our results of operations in 2011. 
2011 Highlights  During
2011, we continued to focus on researching new technologies, developing strategic alliances, introducing new products, increasing production capacity, reducing product costs, funding capital improvements, and improving production processes. Some of
these efforts are described below:

 Revenue in 2011 increased 29% to $157.3 million, compared with $121.9 million in 2010. Ultracapacitor
product revenue increased by 42% to $97.0 million in 2011, compared with $68.5 million in the prior year. Sales of high voltage capacitor products totaled $42.3 million for 2011, up 18% from the $35.7 million recorded in 2010. Revenue from our
microelectronic products was relatively flat year-over-year. The increase in revenue was influenced primarily by higher volume in our ultracapacitor product line associated with continuing strong demand for energy storage and power delivery systems
for hybrid energy and electric transit vehicles and micro hybrid automotive systems, as well as backup power applications for enterprise computing systems, and the sale of our proprietary electrode material.

A substantial amount of our revenue is generated through our Swiss subsidiary which has a
functional currency of the Swiss Franc. As such, reported revenue can be materially impacted by the changes in exchange rates between the Swiss Franc and the U.S. Dollar, our reporting currency. Due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar
against the Swiss Franc during 2011 compared with 2010, revenue was positively impacted by $6.3 million.  The following table
presents revenue mix by product line for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:

 Gross profit in 2011 increased $15.2 million, or 32%, to $62.1 million compared with 2010. As a
percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 39% in 2011 compared with 38% in 2010. Of the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars, $13.6 million related to an increase in the volume of sales and $2.7 million was due to net reductions of
product costs. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in gross profit in absolute dollars of $1.2 million related to net foreign exchange losses recorded in 2011 compared with net foreign exchange gains recorded in 2010. We hedge intercompany and
third-party asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the local currency. The net foreign exchange gains or losses recognized are the transaction gains and losses incurred on the hedged assets and liabilities, net of the
gains and losses realized on the hedge contracts. Product cost reductions related primarily to our high-voltage capacitors product line, and were due to price increases, material cost reductions, and a shift in sales mix to higher margin products.
In addition, product design advancements allowed us to continue to reduce the product costs of our large cell ultracapacitor product line.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 24% of revenue in 2011, compared with 29% in 2010,
while total expense increased by $2.3 million, or 7%. The increase in absolute dollars was driven primarily by an increase of $2.8 million in legal fees and an increase of $1.4 million in labor costs due to headcount growth in our sales and
marketing operations. Increased legal fees in 2011 related to certain ongoing legal matters, including indemnification of certain past officers concerning the FCPA matter, efforts related to protection of our intellectual property, and other
corporate matters. In addition, we experienced an increase in recruiting expenses, information technology expenses, marketing consulting fees, and selling expenses totaling approximately $1.8 million, related to the ongoing growth of our business.
In 2011, we also recorded an accrual for the anticipated settlement of a customer dispute of $2.3 million. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in net foreign exchange losses of $1.2 million, primarily due to a change in hedging strategy. In
2011, we recorded net foreign exchange losses of $498,000 compared with $1.7 million in net foreign exchange losses in 2010. Further offsetting these increases were decreases associated with a $5.1 million charge in 2010 related to settlement of the
FCPA matter and an asset impairment of $880,000 related to equipment that was reclassified from held-for-sale to held-and-used.

 Research and development expense was $22.3 million in 2011 compared with $17.7 million in 2010, an
increase of approximately $4.6 million or 26%. However, as a percentage of revenues, research and development expense was 14% in 2011 compared with 15% in 2010. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by the continued expansion of our research
and development activities, including primarily an increase of $3.5 million in labor expense due to headcount additions, an increase of $1.6 million in facilities and information technology expenses related to expansion of our research and
development facilities, and an increase of $1.2 million in expenses related to new product development and research programs partially funded by governments. These increases were offset by additional government funding of our research and
development activities of $2.0 million.  Amortization of debt discount and prepaid debt costs 
Amortization of debt discount and prepaid debt costs was $55,000 in 2011 compared with $83,000 in 2010, a decrease of approximately
$28,000. The amortization period for the debt discount and prepaid debt costs was associated with the original payment terms for the convertible debentures, wherein final payment was due on December 31, 2010, however, the holder elected to
defer three quarterly installments to 2011.  Gain (loss) on embedded derivatives and warrants 
The gain on embedded derivatives was $1.1 million in 2011 compared with $2.3 million in 2010. The gain or loss recorded on the embedded
derivative and warrants primarily represents the change in the fair market value on revaluation of the debenture conversion rights and warrants at the end of the year, or conversion dates, compared to the beginning of the year. In December 2010, the
warrants were exercised in full, and in February 2011, the remaining principal balance of the convertible debentures was converted to shares of our common stock. Following these transactions, there will be no further impact to the consolidated
statement of operations related to the fair value measurement of these derivative instruments and warrants.  Provision for Income Taxes
 We recorded an income tax provision of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $1.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010. This provision is primarily related to our Swiss operations. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the United
States taxes that may be payable as it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the United States. The Company has established a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty
surrounding the realization of such assets as evidenced by the cumulative losses from operations through December 31, 2011. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and at such time as it is determined
that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly.  Year Ended
December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009  In 2010, net loss decreased $16.9 million, or 74%,
compared with the prior year. Net loss reported for 2010 was $6.1 million, or $0.23 per share, while net loss was $22.9 million, or $0.94 per share, in 2009. The decrease in net loss was driven primarily by an increase in revenues combined with
improvements in gross profit and 
  36

operating margins. In addition, there was a decrease of $4.2 million in accruals for settlement of U.S. FCPA violations and in 2010, we recorded a $2.3 million gain, versus a $5.3 million loss in
2009, on embedded derivatives and warrants. Offsetting these improvements, we incurred a $1.4 million charge related to an impairment and depreciation adjustment for assets that we no longer believe are probable of sale and were reclassified during
the fourth quarter from held-for-sale to held-and-used.  Revenue and Gross Profit

 Revenue in 2010 increased 20% to $121.9 million, compared with $101.3 million in 2009. Ultracapacitor
revenue increased by 56% to $68.5 million in 2010, compared with $43.8 million in the prior year. Sales of high voltage capacitor products totaled $35.7 million for 2010, down 10% from the $39.8 million recorded in 2009. Revenue from our
microelectronic products was flat year-over-year. The increase in revenue from our ultracapacitor product line was influenced primarily by continuing strong demand for energy storage and power delivery systems for wind energy, hybrid and electric
transit vehicles, micro hybrid automotive systems, backup power and wireless communications. The decline in our high voltage capacitor product revenues was a result of a shift in the mix of high voltage product sales to lower priced products.
 A substantial amount of our revenue is generated through our Swiss subsidiary which has a functional currency of the Swiss
Franc. As such, reported revenue can be materially impacted by the changes in exchange rates between the Swiss Franc and the U.S. Dollar, our reporting currency. Due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Swiss Franc during 2010
compared with 2009, revenue was positively impacted by $2.4 million.  The following table presents revenue mix by product line
for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:

 Gross profit in 2010 increased $11.6 million, or 33%, to $46.9 million compared with 2009. As a
percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 38% in 2010 compared with 35% in 2009. Of the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars, $7.2 million related to an increase in the volume of sales, $2.7 million was due to net reductions of
product costs, and $1.7 million related to net foreign exchange gains recorded in 2010 compared with net foreign exchange losses recorded in 2009. We hedge intercompany and third-party asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other
than the local currency. The net foreign exchange gains or losses recognized are

the transaction gains and losses incurred on the hedged assets and liabilities, net of the gains and losses realized on the hedge contracts. Product cost reductions were driven primarily by
advancements in our manufacturing process and product design. The product design advancements allowed us to reduce product cost of our large cell ultracapacitor product line.  Selling, General & Administrative Expense  The following table

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 29% of revenue in 2010, compared with 33% in 2009,
while total expense increased by $2.3 million, or 7%. The increase in absolute dollars was driven primarily by $2.1 million in higher labor costs due to increases in our sales and marketing operations, and an increase in net foreign exchanges
losses. In 2010, we recorded net foreign exchange losses of $1.7 million compared with $396,000 in net foreign exchange gains in 2009. In addition, facilities-related expenses increased by $550,000 in 2010, and travel-related expenses increased by
$421,000. We also recorded an asset impairment of $880,000 in 2010, related to equipment that was reclassified from held-for-sale to held-and-used. These increases were offset by a $4.2 million decrease in expense for the accrual for settlement of
the FCPA matter. In 2010, we recorded accruals for settlement of the FCPA matter of $5.1 million, while in 2009 we recorded accruals for settlement of the FCPA matter of $9.3 million.  Research and Development Expense  The following table presents

 Research and development expense was $17.7 million in 2010 compared with $16.0 million in 2009, an
increase of approximately $1.8 million or 11%. However, as a percentage of revenues, research and development expense was 15% in 2010 compared with 16% in 2009. The increase in absolute dollars was driven primarily by an increase in expenses of
$870,000 related to consulting services and materials used for product development, an increase of $590,000 in labor expense and an increase of $439,000 in facilities and information technology expenses. During 2010, we continued to expand our
efforts to develop existing and new products.  Amortization of debt discount and prepaid debt costs 
Amortization of debt discount and prepaid debt costs was $83,000 in 2010 compared with $737,000 in 2009, a decrease of approximately
$654,000. The amortization period for the debt discount and prepaid debt costs was associated with the original payment terms for the convertible debentures, wherein final payment was due on December 31, 2010, however, the holder elected to
defer three quarterly installments to 2011.

Gain (loss) on embedded derivatives and warrants 
The gain on embedded derivatives was $2.3 million in 2010 compared with a loss of $5.3 million in 2009. The gain or loss recorded on the
embedded derivative and warrants primarily represents the change in the fair market value on revaluation of the debenture conversion rights and warrants at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year. In December 2010, the warrants
were exercised in full, and in February 2011, the remaining principal balance of the convertible debentures was converted to shares of our common stock. Following these transactions, there will be no further impact to the consolidated statement of
operations related to the fair value measurement of these derivative instruments and warrants.  Provision for Income Taxes 
We recorded an income tax provision of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $2.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009. This provision is primarily related to our Swiss operations. The 2009 tax provision included a one-time non-cash tax provision of $1.7 million associated with the transfer of certain intellectual property from
Switzerland to the U.S. in order to maximize utilization of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the
United States taxes that may be payable as it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the United States. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable
because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation.  Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Net cash used in operating activities was $5.1 million in 2011. This usage of cash related primarily to
increased inventory levels of $8.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable balances of $9.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable is due to revenue growth as well as significant sales in the last month of 2011. The increase in
inventories relates to anticipated sales growth, as well as a change in our inventory management strategy to ensure that we are able to meet our customers delivery requirements. In addition, we made settlement payments totaling $6.7 million to
the SEC and DOJ during the first quarter of 2011. Excluding this cash outflow, there was a $9.6 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities primarily correlating to the increase in inventory, which
positively impacted cash flows. In addition, included in 2011 net income of $849,000 are net non-cash charges of $9.2 million which negatively impact the statement of operations but do not impact cash. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$8.7 million in 2010 and net cash used in operating activities was $1.0 million in 2009. Although we achieved positive net income in 2011 of $849,000 compared with a net loss of $6.1 million in 2010, which contributed to an improvement in our
operating cash flows, this improvement in cash flows was offset by settlement payments in 2011 to the SEC and DOJ of $6.7 million, as well as a significant consumption of cash related to increased accounts receivable and inventory balances, as
compared with 2010.

Table of Contents
Our net cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, compared with $8.8 million in 2010 and $5.0 million in 2009. Capital expenditures in 2011 were primarily focused on investments in a corporate research and development facility, information technology infrastructure and
increased production capacity. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 and 2009 was primarily related to capital expenditures focused on increasing our production capacity to meet future demand. 
Our net cash provided by financing activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with $9.9 million in
2010 and $22.7 million in 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2011, cash proceeds resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plans of $2.8 million, as well as the release of $8.0 million in
restricted cash upon the settlement of the remaining principal balance of our convertible debentures. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received cash proceeds of $7.5 million from the exercise of stock warrants. 
Liquidity 
As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $29.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $46.2 million. In
addition, our credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings up to $27.5 million, with $15 million available to fund operations and $12.5 million available to finance capital expenditures through April 30, 2012. As of December 31, 2011,
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility, therefore, the full amount was available to us. However, we are subject to certain financial covenants and other requirements under the credit agreement, and if we fail to meet these
requirements, the credit facility may not be available to us.  Management believes that cash we expect to generate from
operations, combined with available cash balances, will be sufficient to fund our operations, obligations as they become due, and capital equipment expenditures for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we may choose to access funds from our
credit facility to supplement our existing cash balances and cash from operating activities. In the future, we may also issue equity. In April 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to, from time to time, sell up to
an aggregate of $125 million of our common stock, warrants or debt securities.  As of December 31, 2011, we have accrued
$7.7 million for the settlement of FCPA violations, with $5.4 million paid in the first quarter of 2012 and $2.3 million payable in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we have accrued approximately $2.3 million for the anticipated settlement of
a customer dispute, of which approximately $648,000 is anticipated to be paid in cash during the first half of 2012, with the remaining amount available to the customer as a discount on future purchases of our products through December 31,
2014. Any balance not used as product discount by December 31, 2014 would be payable in cash at that time. This settlement is not yet final, and is therefore subject to change until a written agreement between the parties is executed.
 As of December 31, 2011, the amount of cash and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries was $10.6 million.
If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S. in the future, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, due to the Companys substantial net operating loss carryforwards, repatriation would
have an immaterial impact on the Companys current tax rate and cash flows.  Credit Facility 
In December 2011, we entered into a credit agreement whereby we obtained a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of
credit up to a maximum of $15.0 million (the Revolving Line of Credit) and an equipment term loan up to a maximum of $12.5 million (the Equipment Term Loan) (together, the Credit Facility). In general, amounts
borrowed under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on all of our assets other than our intellectual property. In addition, under the credit agreement, we are required to pledge 65% of our equity interests in our Swiss subsidiary. We have also
agreed not to encumber any of our intellectual property. The agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, amongst other things; (i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantees; (ii) create liens or other
encumbrances on our property; (iii) enter into a 
  40 


Table of Contents

merger or similar transaction; (iiii) invest in another entity; (iv) declare or pay dividends; and (v) invest in fixed assets in excess of a defined dollar amount. Repayment of
amounts owed pursuant to the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representations, warranties and covenants made in the credit agreement, including certain financial covenants. The financial covenants that
we must meet on a quarterly basis during the term of the credit agreement include a minimum liquidity ratio, a minimum quick ratio, and quarterly EBITDA and net income targets. It is uncertain whether we will be able to meet these financial
covenants over the term of the credit agreement. If we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this credit agreement, then the credit facility may be withdrawn and the bank could require us to immediately repay any outstanding obligation.
 Revolving Line of Credit  We may use borrowings under the Revolving Line of Credit for general working capital and corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit bear interest, payable monthly, at either
(i) the banks prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.25%, at our option subject to certain limitations. We must also pay an unused commitment fee, payable quarterly, equal to 0.25% per annum of the average daily unused amount of the
Revolving Line of Credit. The Revolving Line of Credit matures on December 5, 2013, and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time.  Equipment Term Loan  We may use borrowings under the Equipment Term Loan to
finance 80% of eligible equipment purchases made between April 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012. Amounts borrowed under the Equipment Term Loan bear interest at either (i) the banks prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.25%, at our
option subject to certain limitations. Interest under the Equipment Term Loan is payable monthly through April 30, 2012, after which time principal and interest owned shall be repaid in 36 equal monthly installments such that the Equipment Term
Loan has been fully repaid by the maturity date of April 30, 2015, but may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. 
As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under either the Revolving Line of Credit or the Equipment Term Loan. Further,
as of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement, therefore, the full amount of the credit facility was available to us.  Other Borrowings  Short-term borrowings 
Maxwells Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA, has a 3.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $3.2 million as of
December 31, 2011) short-term loan agreement with a Swiss bank, which renews semi-annually and bears interest at 2.25%. Borrowings under the short-term loan agreement are unsecured and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the full amount of
the loan was drawn.  Maxwell SA has a 2.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $2.1 million as of
December 31, 2011) credit agreement with a Swiss bank, which renews annually and bears interest at 2.5%. Borrowings under the credit agreement are unsecured and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the full amount available under the credit
line was drawn.  Maxwell SA also has a 1.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $1.1 million as of
December 31, 2011) credit agreement with another Swiss bank, and the available balance of the line can be withdrawn or reduced by the bank at any time. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no amounts were drawn under the credit line. Interest
rates applicable to any draws on the line will be determined at the time of draw. 
  41 


Table of Contents
Maxwell SA entered into a lending agreement for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment
in an amount up to 1.5 million Swiss Francs. After the acquisition of the equipment was completed the agreement converted to 48 monthly payments of 34,302 Swiss Francs with an interest rate of 2.22%. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
balance of the obligation was $0 and $210,000, respectively, with the final payment made in the second quarter of 2011.  Long-term
borrowings  The Company has various financing agreements for vehicles. These agreements are for up to a five year repayment
period with interest rates ranging from 4.9% to 7.0%. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $164,000 and $177,000, respectively, was outstanding under these agreements.  Dividends  Over the remaining term of the Credit Facility, which is
scheduled to expire in April 2015, we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends.  Contractual Obligations

(3)
Debt obligations represent long-term and short-term borrowings and interest payable of $137,000. 


(4)
Pension benefit payments represent the expected amounts to be paid for pension benefits. 


(5)
Amounts represent remaining settlement payments due to the SEC and DOJ with respect to the FCPA matter. 


(6)
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, we are unable to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $448,000 of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. 
Critical Accounting Estimates  We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2)
changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which discusses the significant accounting policies.  We believe the following are either (i) critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates or assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or
(ii) other key accounting policies that may require us to make difficult or subjective judgments.  Revenue Recognition 
Nature of Estimates Required. Sales revenue is primarily derived from the sale of products directly to customers. For certain
long-term contracts, revenue is recognized ratably as costs are incurred, or upon the delivery of final work products or the satisfaction of contractually-defined milestones. For license fees and services, revenue is recognized when the performance
requirements have been met.  Assumptions and Approach Used. Product revenue is recognized when all of the
following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (upon contract signing or receipt of an authorized purchase order from a customer); (2) title passes to the customer at either shipment from our facilities or
receipt at the customer facility, depending on shipping terms; (3) price is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Customer purchase orders and/or
contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents are used to verify product delivery. We assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction. If a
volume discount is offered, revenue is recognized at the lowest price offered to the customer. We assess the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily upon creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as
well as the customers payment history.  Revenue recognized on a percentage of completion basis is measured by the
percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated costs for each contract and is limited by the funding of the primary contractor. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. The estimated contract costs are based on historical experience and assumptions regarding future contractual obligations. We regularly review these estimates and consider the impact of recurring business risks and uncertainties inherent
in the contracts, such as implementation delays due to factors within or outside our control. Under the milestone method, revenue is recognized for the contractual consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as
revenue in the period the milestone is achieved if the milestone is determined to be substantive.  Excess and Obsolete Inventory
 Nature of Estimates Required. Estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the ability to sell the
items in our inventory. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations. 
Assumptions and Approach Used. Our estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is evaluated on a quarterly basis and is based
on rolling historical inventory usage and assumptions regarding future product sales and requirements. As actual levels of inventory change or specific products become slow moving or obsolete, our estimated reserve may materially
change.  Pension  Nature of Estimates Required. We use several significant assumptions within the actuarial models that measure the pension benefit obligations and to estimate the fair values of real estate assets.

  43 


Table of Contents
Assumptions and Approach Used. Discount rate and expected return on assets are
important elements of plan expense and asset and liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually. In addition, we appraise the fair value of real estate assets annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions
involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of
economic and other factors. The projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 was $26.7 million and the fair value of plan assets was $33.1 million.  Stock-Based Compensation  Nature of Estimates Required. Our
stock-based awards include stock option grants, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan. We record compensation expense for our stock-based awards in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Stock
Compensation Subtopic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification. Under the guidance, the fair value of each employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets
certain requirements. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of the guidance, but the fair values generated by the model may not be
indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility,
expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. 
Assumptions and Approach Used. We estimate an expected dividend yield of zero because we have never paid cash dividends and
have no present intention to pay cash dividends. In addition, over the remaining term of the Credit Facility, which is scheduled to expire in April 2015, we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends. Expected volatility is based on our
historical stock prices using a mathematical formula to measure the standard deviation of the change in the natural logarithm of our underlying stock price that is expected over a period of time commensurate with the expected option life. The
risk-free interest rate is derived from the zero coupon rate on U.S. Treasury instruments for the options expected life. The expected life calculation is based on the actual life of historical stock option grants. 
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on options and awards ultimately
expected to vest. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates with a cumulative catch up adjustment. 
We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock-based awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions,
stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of stock-based awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining, unrecognized
stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities our stock-based compensation expense will increase by the fair value of the additional grants. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that
are expected to vest and therefore we estimate a forfeiture rate and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differs from the prior estimates. In addition, for restricted stock awards with performance-based vesting
criteria, we estimate the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and recognize compensation expense related to those awards expected to vest. Compensation expense may be significantly impacted in the future to the extent our
estimates differ from actual results. 
  44 


Table of Contents
Income Taxes  Nature of Estimates Required. We record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is not likely. Not included in the net
operating loss deferred tax asset is approximately $8.8 million of deferred tax asset attributable to excess stock option deductions. According to a provision within Accounting Standards Codification 718, Stock Compensation, concerning when
tax benefits related to excess stock option deductions can be credited to paid-in capital, the related valuation allowance cannot be reversed, even if the facts and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not than the deferred tax asset can be
realized. The valuation allowance will only be reversed as the related deferred tax asset is applied to reduce taxes payable.  Assumptions and Approach Used. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover
our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and
results of recent operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in this evaluation. If we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future, we will record an adjustment to increase
their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income or additional paid in capital, as appropriate, in that same period. 
Commitments and Contingencies  Nature of Estimates Required. We are involved in litigation, regulatory and other proceedings and claims. We prosecute and defend these matters aggressively. However, there are many
uncertainties associated with any litigation, and there can be no assurance that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. 
Assumptions and Approach Used. We disclose information concerning contingent liabilities with respect to these claims and
proceedings for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. We recognize liabilities for these claims and proceedings as appropriate based upon the probability of loss and our ability to estimate losses and to fairly present, in conjunction
with the disclosures of these matters in our consolidated financial statements, managements view of our exposure. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as appropriate to assess probability and estimates of loss. We
will recognize a liability related to claims and proceedings at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recognized liability will be the best
estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recognized.  We re-evaluate these assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be recognized or if any existing liability should be adjusted.
The actual cost of ultimately resolving a claim or proceeding may be substantially different from the amount of the recognized liability. In addition, because it is not permissible to recognize a liability until the loss is both probable and
estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to recognize a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). 
Minority Equity Interests in Subsidiaries  PurePulse, which suspended operations in 2002 and was classified as discontinued operations in 2006, has minority equity investors. These investors are former employees who were issued shares when
PurePulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 minority investors owned approximately 11% of the outstanding stock of PurePulse, however, since
PurePulse suspended operations in 2002 the consolidation of this entity has a nominal impact on our financial statements.

Impact of Inflation  We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of our fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. However, there can be no assurance
that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.  Pending Accounting Pronouncements
 In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05,
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (loss) as part of
the statement of shareholders equity. Instead, we must report comprehensive income (loss) in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income (loss) which contains two sections, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income
(loss), or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their
respective components of net income and other comprehensive income. This new guidance and deferral is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of the standard update to
impact our financial position or results of operations, as it only requires a change in the format of presentation.  In May
2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The new guidance results in a consistent
definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. While many of the amendments to U.S. GAAP are not expected to have a significant
effect on practice, the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the
adoption of the standard update to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.  In December
2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210), Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which requires companies to disclose information about financial instruments that have been
offset and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. Companies will be required to provide both net (offset amounts) and gross information in the notes
to the financial statements for relevant assets and liabilities that are offset. This standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We do not expect the adoption of
the standard update to impact our financial position or results of operations, as it only requires additional disclosure in our financial statements.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  None. 
Outlook  We will
continue to focus on growth opportunities for our ultracapacitor product line in 2012 by identifying and pursuing new and expanded applications in multiple industries, including transportation, automotive, renewable energy, backup power and
industrial electronics. We have increased production capacity for all of our ultracapacitor products, both internally and through offshore contract assembly relationships. We expect growth of our large cell ultracapacitor products to be augmented in
2012 by increasing sales for voltage stabilization and idle-stop-start functionality in micro hybrid automobiles. We expect total revenue to continue to grow in 2012 at a rate similar to that experienced in 2011, driven primarily by increasing sales
of ultracapacitor products. However, for the first quarter of 2012, considering the impact of normal seasonal softness, including the impact of the Chinese New Year, we expect revenue growth to be lower than the expected annual rate. 
  46 


Table of Contents
Advances in manufacturing processes, design enhancements for our large and medium-size
ultracapacitor products, low-cost offshore assembly and material sourcing and increasing sales volume, have all contributed to improvement of our manufacturing cost structure in recent years. In 2012, we expect to maintain or slightly improve the
gross profit level of 39% achieved in 2010.  As we continue to increase revenue, we expect selling, general and administrative
expenses to increase with the addition of sales personnel as well as customer facing application engineers who will assist customers in implementing current ultracapacitor applications and developing new applications. We also expect research and
development expenses for our ultracapacitor product line to increase as we continue to focus on material science and new product design and development. In 2012, although operating expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars, we expect
operating expenses to remain consistent with, or decline slightly from, 2011 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. We expect that continued revenue growth and gross profit improvement will enable the Company to generate profit from
operations in 2012.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $23.5 million in 2012. Fifty five percent of our
planned capital spending is focused on ultracapacitor production capacity expansion and investments to improve manufacturing processes. Increasing our high voltage capacitor production capacity based on our current product mix makes up another
twenty percent of our planned capital spending. An additional twenty percent will support research and development for our microelectronics product line. The remaining five percent of our planned capital spending is related to completion of a new
corporate research and development facility and implementation of a financial planning and analysis application, as well as other IT applications, to support expected growth. 
 


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  We face exposure to financial market risks, including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. These exposures may change over time and could have a material
adverse impact on our financial results. We have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk, except as follows:  Foreign Currency Risk  Our primary foreign currency exposure is related to
our subsidiary in Switzerland. Maxwell SA has Euro and local currency (Swiss Franc) revenue, and operating expenses as well as local currency loans. Changes in these currency exchange rates impact the reported amount (U.S. dollar) of revenue,
expenses and debt. As part of our risk management strategy, we use forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Our objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the forward
contracts, thereby reducing volatility of earnings. We use the forward contracts to hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in a foreign currency. The change in fair value of these
instruments represents a natural hedge as their gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency exchange rates. We enter into these foreign currency forward
contracts on the last business day of each calendar quarter, therefore, as of December 31, 2011, the impact of any theoretical change in foreign currency exchange rates on the hedged monetary assets and liabilities would be equally offset by
the gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts.  Interest Rate Risk 
At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $5.5 million in debt, $68,000 of which is classified as long-term debt. Changes in
interest rates may affect the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. The impact on earnings or cash flow during the next fiscal year from a change of 100 basis points (or 1%) in the interest rate would have a $55,000 effect on
interest expense. 
  47 


Table of Contents
Fair Value Risk  We have a pension asset of $6.4 million at December 31, 2011, including plan assets of $33.1 million, which are recorded at fair value. The plan assets consist of 86% debt and equity securities,
12% real estate and 2% cash and cash equivalents. The fair value measurement of the real estate is subject to the real estate market forces in Switzerland. The fair value of debt and equity securities is determined based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and is subject to interest rate risk. We manage our risk by having a diversified portfolio. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the pension assets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders  Maxwell Technologies, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Maxwell Technologies, Inc.s and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Maxwell Technologies, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business  Maxwell Technologies, Inc. is a Delaware corporation originally incorporated in 1965 under the name Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. In 1983, the Company completed an initial public offering, and in 1996,
changed its name to Maxwell Technologies, Inc. The Company is headquartered in San Diego, California and has two manufacturing locations, San Diego, California and Rossens, Switzerland, and is in the process of opening a manufacturing facility in
Peoria, Arizona. In addition, the Company has two contract manufacturers located in China. Maxwell operates as one operating segment called High Reliability, which is comprised of three product lines: 
 


 

 
 Ultracapacitors: Our primary focus, ultracapacitors, are energy storage devices that possess a unique combination of high power density,
extremely long operational life and the ability to charge and discharge very rapidly. Our ultracapacitor cells and multi-cell packs and modules provide highly reliable energy storage and power delivery solutions for applications in multiple
industries, including transportation, automotive, information technology, renewable energy and industrial electronics.   


 

 
 High-Voltage Capacitors: Our CONDIS® high-voltage capacitors are extremely robust devices that are designed and manufactured to perform reliably for decades in all climates. These products include
grading and coupling capacitors and capacitive voltage dividers that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport, distribution and measurement of high-voltage electrical
energy.   


 

 
 Radiation-Hardened Microelectronic Products: Our radiation-hardened microelectronic products include high-performance, high-density power
modules, memory modules and single board computers that incorporate our proprietary RADPAK® packaging and
shielding technology and novel architectures that enable them to withstand environmental radiation effects and perform reliably in space.  The Companys products are designed and manufactured to perform reliably for the life of the products and systems into which they are integrated. The Company achieves high reliability through the
application of proprietary technologies and rigorously controlled design, development, manufacturing and test processes.  Financial
Statement Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Maxwell
Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.  Liquidity  As of December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $29.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, in December 2011, we obtained a line of credit to borrow up to $27.5 million, with $15
million of the 
  55 


Table of Contents

line of credit available to support increases in working capital and $12.5 million available to provide long term financing for capital expenditures. In the future, we may supplement these
sources of cash by issuing debt or equity. In April 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $125 million of our common stock, warrants or debt securities. 
In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to
charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other securities law violations. Under the terms of
the settlement with the SEC, the Company will pay a total of $6.4 million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest in two installments, with $3.2 million paid in each of the first quarters of 2011 and 2012. Under the terms of the settlement
with the DOJ, the Company will pay a total of $8.0 million in penalties in three installments, with $3.5 million paid in the first quarter of 2011, $2.3 million paid in the first quarter of 2012 and $2.3 million payable in the first quarter of 2013.
 Based on the Companys assessment of its current and long-term obligations, management believes it will have adequate
resources to fund operations, obligations as they become due, and capital equipment expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation. These reclassifications do not impact the reported net loss and do not have a material impact on the presentation of the overall financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. These estimates include, but are not limited to,
assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, applied and unapplied production costs, production capacities, the usage and recoverability of inventories and long-lived assets, deferred income taxes, the incurrence of warranty obligations,
stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimation of the cost to complete certain projects, the probability that the performance criteria of restricted stock awards will be met and the fair value of
warrants and accruals for estimated losses from legal matters.  Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is derived primarily from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers. Product revenue is recognized, according to the
guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Numbers 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and 104, Revenue Recognition, when all of the following
criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (upon contract signing or receipt of an authorized purchase order from a customer); (2) title passes to the customer at either shipment from the Companys facilities
or receipt at the customer facility, depending on shipping terms; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. If a volume
discount is offered, revenue is recognized at the lowest price to the customer. This method has been consistently applied from period to period and there is no right of return. 
Revenue generated from certain long-term, fixed price contracts is recognized either on a percentage of completion basis or on a
milestone basis, depending on which method management determines best reflects the progress of performance under the contract. Under the milestone method, revenue is recognized for the contractual consideration that is contingent upon achievement of
a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period the milestone is achieved if the milestone is determined to be substantive. Under the percentage of 
  56 


Table of Contents

completion basis, revenue is measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated costs for each contract, as required by the Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts
Subtopic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC), and is limited by the funding of the prime contractor. Provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made in the period
in which such losses are determined.  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies, bank certificates of deposit, commercial
paper and high-quality corporate issuers. All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less from purchase are considered cash equivalents.  Restricted Cash  At December 31, 2010, the Companys
convertible debenture agreement required the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of at least $8.0 million. This amount was classified as restricted cash at December 31, 2010. In February 2011, the holder of the Companys convertible
debentures elected to convert the remaining principal balance of the convertible debentures into shares of the Companys common stock. As a result of the conversion, the restricted cash balance of $8.0 million was released. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Trade receivables are stated at gross invoiced amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects managements best estimate of probable losses inherent
in the accounts receivable balance. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known troubled accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
first-out basis) or market. Finished goods and work-in-process inventory values include the cost of raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventory when written down to market value establishes a new cost basis and its value is not
subsequently increased based upon changes in underlying facts and circumstances. The Company makes adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, for estimated excess or obsolete inventories. Factors
influencing these adjustments include inventories on-hand compared to historical and estimated future sales for existing and new products and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence. Unabsorbed and underabsorbed costs are treated as expense
in the period incurred.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (three to ten years).
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the lease. Leasehold improvements funded by the landlord are recorded as assets and deferred liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $3.7 million and $745,000, respectively, of unamortized leasehold improvements funded by landlords. The Company had a related amount of deferred rent of $2.1 million and $871,000, respectively,
which is included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, at December 31, 2011 and 2010.  Goodwill
 Goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net fair value assigned to its
assets and liabilities, is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is assessed for impairment under the Intangibles

Table of Contents

Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC. The Company has established December 31 as the annual impairment test date. The Company first makes a qualitative
assessment as to whether goodwill is impaired and if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company performs a two-step quantitative impairment analysis to determine if goodwill is impaired. The Company may also determine to skip
the qualitative assessment in any year and move directly to the quantitative test. No impairments of goodwill were reported during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.  Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets  Property and equipment and
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, a
permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived or intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of
ten to thirteen years. In 2010, the Company recorded an impairment of property and equipment of $880,000 to reduce the carrying value of equipment to its estimated fair value. This impairment charge related to the reclassification of assets that
were previously classified as held-for-sale, to held-and-used, during the fourth quarter of 2010. No impairments of property and equipment or intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009. 
Warranty Obligation  The Company provides product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales. The majority of the Companys warranties are for one to two years in the normal course of business. The Company
accrues for the estimated warranty at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure.  Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are provided on a liability
method in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Under this
method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts at each period end. If it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. The guidance also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures of uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based solely on its technical merits.  Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company maintains cash balances at
various financial institutions primarily in California and in Switzerland. In California, cash balances commonly exceed the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. In Switzerland, the banks where the Company has cash deposits
are either government-owned, or in the case of cash deposited with non-government banks, deposits are insured up to 100,000 Swiss Francs. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not
exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to such cash and cash equivalents.  Financial instruments, which subject
the Company to potential concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of the Companys accounts receivable. The Companys accounts receivable result from product sales to customers in various industries and in various geographical
areas, both domestic and foreign. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and generally requires no collateral. There were no sales to a single customer amounting to more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010. One customer accounted for 10% of total revenue in 2009. In addition, one customer accounted for 12% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011.

Research and Development Expense 
Research and development expenditures are expensed in the period incurred. Third-party funding of research and development expense under
cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as an offset to research and development expense in the period the expenses are incurred. 
Advertising Expense  Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expense was $287,000, $256,000 and $52,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Shipping and Handling Expense  The Company recognizes shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of revenue. Total shipping and handling expense included in cost of revenue was $2.9 million, $1.3 million, and $878,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Patent Defense Costs 
The Company capitalizes patent defense costs as additional cost of the patents when a successful outcome in the patent defense case is
probable. If the Company is ultimately unsuccessful the costs would be charged to expense. Legal expenses associated with a previous patent infringement lawsuit against NessCap were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining life of the
patents. In February 2009, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with NessCap, whereby Maxwell and NessCap agreed to drop all pending claims against each other and entered into a ten year, worldwide cross license of each companys
patents. As part of the settlement agreement, NessCap must pay $1 million to Maxwell in annual installments of $200,000 through 2013. In 2010, NessCap posted a letter of credit for all remaining settlement payments owed to the Company in
accordance with the terms of the settlement. During the case, the Company had capitalized the patent defense costs as additional cost of the patents. The full settlement amount of $1 million has been netted against these capitalized patent defense
costs, and the net amount is being amortized over the remaining lives of these patents. As of December 31, 2011, unamortized patent defense costs of $681,000 are classified as intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Foreign Currencies 
The Companys primary foreign currency exposure is related to its subsidiary in Switzerland, which has Euro and local currency (Swiss
Franc) revenue and operating expenses, and local currency loans. Changes in these currency exchange rates impact the reported U.S. dollar amount of revenue, expenses and debt. The functional currency of the Swiss subsidiary is the Swiss Franc.
Assets and liabilities of the Swiss subsidiary are translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at rates of exchange that approximate the rate in effect at the time of the transaction. Any
translation adjustments resulting from this process are presented separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are reported in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments  As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Maxwells objective is to offset gains or losses resulting from these
exposures with opposing gains or losses on the forward contracts, thereby reducing volatility of earnings created by these foreign currency exposures. In accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, the fair values of
the forward contracts are estimated based on quoted market prices and all forward contracts are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets at fair value. Any gains or losses recognized on these contracts are recorded in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Net Income (Loss) per Share  In accordance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the FASB ASC, basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share includes the impact of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares were issued. Potentially dilutive securities are not considered in the calculation of diluted net loss
per share, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):

Stock-Based Compensation 
The Companys primary types of stock-based compensation awards include stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock
units, and an employee stock purchase plan. The Company records compensation expense for stock-based awards in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Stock Compensation Subtopic of the FASB ASC. Under the guidance, the fair value of
each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair
value of stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the Companys stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The fair value of
restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. In addition, for restricted stock awards with performance-based vesting criteria, the Company estimates the
probability of achievement of the performance criteria and recognize compensation expense related to those awards expected to vest.  Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on stock options and restricted stock ultimately expected to vest. The guidance requires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods with a cumulative catch up adjustment if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Pending Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2011, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the statement of shareholders equity. Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income (loss) in either a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income (loss) which contains two sections, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the specific requirement to present
items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income. This new guidance and deferral is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard update to impact its financial position or results of operations, as it only requires a change in the format of presentation. 
In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and
International Financial Reporting Standards. While many of the amendments to U.S. GAAP are not expected to have a significant effect in practice, the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. This new
guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of the standard update to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.
 In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210), Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which requires companies to disclose information about financial instruments that have been offset and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those
arrangements on its financial position. Companies will be required to provide both net (offset amounts) and gross information in the notes to the financial statements for relevant assets and liabilities that are offset. This standard will be
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard update to impact its financial position or results of operations, as it only
requires additional disclosure in the Companys financial statements.

Note 3Goodwill and Intangibles 
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually according to the IntangiblesGoodwill and Other Topic
of the FASB ASC. The Company makes a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment and if it concludes that it is more than likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, then it
will be required to perform the first step of the two-step quantitative impairment test. Otherwise, performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The first step consists of estimating the fair value and comparing the estimated fair value
with the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill
is the residual fair value derived by 
  63 


Table of Contents

deducting the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities from its estimated total fair value, which was calculated in step one. An impairment charge would represent the excess
of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The guidance requires goodwill to be tested annually at the same time every year or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it
is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. The Company selected December 31 as its annual testing date. As a result of the Companys annual assessments as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, no impairment was indicated.
 The change in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2010 and 2011 was as follows (in thousands):

 Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset
exceeds its fair value.  The composition of intangible assets subject to amortization at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was

Note 4Convertible Debentures 
On December 20, 2005, the Company issued $25 million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated
convertible debentures (the Debentures) due and payable in quarterly installments of $2.8 million which commenced December 2008. However, the holder, at its election, could defer each quarterly payment one time, for a 24 month period. As
the holder had elected to defer some quarterly installments, the outstanding principal of the Debentures at December 31, 2010 was $8.3 million. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rate on the Debentures was 1.375%, and the accrued
interest was $29,000.  At the issuance date, the Debentures were convertible by the holder at any time into 1,315,789 common
shares. The Company also issued 394,737 warrants in connection with the issuance of the Debentures; these warrants had an expiration date of December 20, 2010 and an exercise price of $19.00 at the issuance date. The exercise price, number of
convertible shares and warrants were subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as the sale of equity securities by the Company. After the issuance date, the Company sold 6.1 million shares through various offerings at a price below $19.00
which adjusted the conversion and warrant price to $16.22. The change in warrant price increased the number of warrants to 462,461. In December 2010, the holders of the warrants exercised their right to purchase 462,461 shares of common stock, which
resulted in the settlement of the stock warrants liability.  As of December 31, 2010, the Debentures were convertible
into 513,845 shares. In February 2011, the holder of the Debentures converted the remaining $8.3 million principal balance into 514,086 shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $16.21 per share. On the conversion date, the
common stock had a fair value of $9.3 million, which was based on the closing market price. This conversion resulted in a gain of $1.0 million, which is included in gain (loss) on embedded derivatives and warrants in the consolidated
statement of operations.  Interest paid with cash and principal converted into shares of common stock are as follows (in
thousands):

 Until the conversion of the remaining principal balance of the Debentures in February 2011, the principal
balance was convertible by the holder at any time into common shares. In addition, after eighteen months from the issue date, the Company could have required that a specified amount of the principal of the Debentures be converted if certain
conditions were satisfied for a period of 20 consecutive trading days. To determine a fair value of this forced conversion the Company applied a Z factor, which is a theoretical measurement of the probability of this occurrence. The probability used
as of December 31, 2010 was 21.5% for forced conversion of 50% of the conversion option at 135% of the original exercise price, and 4.7% for forced conversion of the remaining conversion option at 175% of the original exercise price.
 The Company accounted for the conversion options in the Debentures and the associated warrants as derivative liabilities in
accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC. The discount at the issuance date attributable to the aggregate fair value of the conversion options and warrants and the issuance costs totaling $9.2 million was amortized
using the effective interest method over the term of the Debentures. 
  65 


Table of Contents

The remaining unamortized discount was $47,000 at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, $6,000 of the discount and prepaid fees were amortized. Upon conversion of the
remaining principal balance of the Debentures into shares of the Companys common stock in February 2011, the remaining unamortized discount was written off and is included in amortization of debt discount and prepaid debt costs in
the consolidated statement of operations.  The change in fair value on revaluation of the conversion rights and warrant
liabilities represents the difference between the fair value at the end of the current period or conversion date and the fair value at the beginning of the current period using the value calculated by the Black-Scholes pricing model. The net fair
value of the liability for the holders and Maxwells conversion rights at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a liability of $2.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which is included in long-term debt, excluding current
portion in the consolidated balance sheet. The effect of the fair market value adjustment was a $78,000 and $2.3 million gain for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and a $4.8 million loss for the year ended
December 31, 2009, which is recorded as gain (loss) on embedded derivatives and warrants in the consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the embedded conversion options was estimated on December 31, 2010 using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions:

 As long as the Debentures were outstanding, the Company was required to maintain a minimum cash balance
of $8.0 million. This amount was classified as restricted cash at December 31, 2010. The cash restriction was released in February 2011 when the outstanding principal amount of the convertible debentures was converted to shares of the
Companys common stock. 
Note 5Fair Value Measurement 
The Company records certain financial instruments at fair value in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC. As of December 31, 2011, the financial instruments to which this topic applied were financial instruments for foreign currency forward contracts, which are valued using quoted market prices. As of
December 31, 2011, the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $704,000 (liability), which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of these
derivative instruments is measured using quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments, which is a Level 1 input under the fair value hierarchy of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC.
 The carrying value of short-term and long-term borrowings approximates fair value because of the relative short maturity of
these instruments and the interest rates the Company could currently obtain.  The convertible debentures issued on
December 20, 2005 were evaluated and determined not to be conventional convertible debentures and, therefore, because of certain terms and provisions including liquidating damages under the associated registration rights agreement, the embedded
conversion features were bifurcated and accounted for as derivative liability instruments until settled in February 2011. The stock warrants issued on December 20, 2005 in conjunction with the convertible debentures were also evaluated and
determined to be a derivative instrument and, therefore, were classified as a liability on the balance sheet until exercised in December 2010. The accounting guidance requires that the conversion features and warrants be recorded at fair

value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair values of the embedded conversion options and stock warrants are based on
Black-Scholes fair value calculations. In December 2010, the stock warrants were exercised, and in February 2011, the remaining $8.3 million principal balance was converted into shares of the Companys common stock, therefore, there was no fair
value measurement to be made as of December 31, 2011.  For those financial instruments with significant Level 3 inputs,

 Refer to Note 4Convertible Debentures for the valuation model and unobservable data used to calculate fair value of the conversion features of
the convertible debentures and warrants issued by the Company. 
Note 6Credit Facility 
In December 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement whereby the Company obtained a secured credit facility in
the form of a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $15.0 million (the Revolving Line of Credit) and an equipment term loan up to a maximum of $12.5 million (the Equipment Term Loan) (together, the Credit
Facility). In general, amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on all of the Companys assets other than our intellectual property. In addition, under the credit agreement, the Company is required to pledge 65% of
its equity interests in its Swiss subsidiary. The Company has also agreed not to encumber any of our intellectual property. The agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit the Companys ability to, amongst other things;
(i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantees; (ii) create liens or other encumbrances on our property; (iii) enter into a merger or similar transaction; (iiii) invest in another entity; (iv) declare or pay dividends;
(v) invest in fixed assets in excess of a defined dollar amount. Repayment of amounts owed pursuant to the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that the Company is in violation of the representations, warranties and covenants made in
the credit agreement, including certain financial covenants. The financial covenants that the Company must meet on a quarterly basis during the term of the credit agreement include a minimum liquidity ratio, a minimum quick ratio, and quarterly
EBITDA and net income targets. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to meet these financial covenants over the term of the credit agreement. If the Company fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this credit agreement, then the
credit facility may be withdrawn and the bank could require immediate repayment of any outstanding obligation.  Revolving Line of Credit
 The Company may use borrowings under the Revolving Line of Credit for general working capital and corporate purposes.
Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit bear interest, payable monthly, at either (i) the banks prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.25%, at the Companys option subject to certain limitations. The Company must also pay
an unused commitment fee, payable quarterly, equal to 0.25% per annum of the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Line of Credit. The Revolving Line of Credit matures on December 5, 2013, and may be prepaid in whole or in part at
any time. 
  67 


Table of Contents
Equipment Term Loan  The Company may use borrowings under the Equipment Term Loan to finance 80% of eligible equipment purchases made between April 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012. Amounts borrowed under the Equipment
Term Loan bear interest at either (i) the banks prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.25%, at the Companys option subject to certain limitations. Interest under the Equipment Term Loan is payable monthly through April 30, 2012,
after which time principal and interest owned shall be repaid in 36 equal monthly installments such that the Equipment Term Loan has been fully repaid by the maturity date of April 30, 2015, but may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time.
 As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under either the Revolving Line of Credit or the Equipment Term
Loan. Further, as of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement, therefore, the full amount of the credit facility was available. 
Note 7Short-Term and Long-Term Borrowings 
Short-term borrowings  Maxwells Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA, has a 3.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $3.2 million as of December 31, 2011) short-term loan agreement with a Swiss bank, which
renews semi-annually and bears interest at 2.25%. Borrowings under the short-term loan agreement are unsecured and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the full amount of the loan was drawn. 
Maxwell SA has a 2.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $2.1 million as of December 31, 2011) credit agreement with
a Swiss bank, which renews annually and bears interest at 2.5%. Borrowings under the credit agreement are unsecured and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the full amount available under the credit line was drawn. 
Maxwell SA also has a 1.0 million Swiss Franc-denominated (approximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2011) credit agreement
with another Swiss bank, and the available balance of the line can be withdrawn or reduced by the bank at any time. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no amounts were drawn under the credit line. Interest rates applicable to any draws on the
line will be determined at the time of draw.  Maxwell SA entered into a lending agreement for the acquisition of manufacturing
equipment in an amount up to 1.5 million Swiss Francs. After the acquisition of the equipment was completed the agreement converted to 48 monthly payments of 34,302 Swiss Francs with an interest rate of 2.22%. As of December 31, 2011 and
2010, the balance of the obligation was $0 and $210,000, respectively, with the final payment made in the second quarter of 2011.

Table of Contents
Long-term borrowings  The Company has various financing agreements for vehicles. These agreements are for up to a five year repayment period with interest rates ranging from 4.9% to 7.0%. At December 31, 2011
and 2010, $164,000 and $177,000, respectively, was outstanding under these agreements.  The following table summarizes debt

Note 8Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments 
Maxwell uses forward contracts to hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables,
denominated in a foreign currency. The change in fair value of these instruments represents a natural hedge as gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency
exchange rates. These contracts generally expire in one month. These contracts are considered economic hedges and are not designated as hedges under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, therefore, the change in the fair value of
the instruments is recognized currently in the consolidated statement of operations.  Net gains (losses) on foreign currency
forward contracts included in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense are as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of foreign currency forward
contracts not designated as hedges was $28.5 million. The fair value of these derivatives was $704,000 (liability) at December 31, 2011. These contracts were entered into in close proximity to year end with spot rates approximating year end
exchange rates. All of the forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 mature on February 2, 2012. For additional information, refer to Note 5Fair Value Measurement. 
The net gains and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts were partially offset by net gains and losses on the underlying
monetary assets and liabilities. Foreign currency gains and losses on those underlying monetary assets and liabilities included in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense are (in thousands):

Note 9Stock Activity and Stock Plans 
2011 Shelf Registration Statement  In April 2011, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $125 million of its common stock,
warrants or debt securities. On August 19, 2011, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which will allow the Company to access the capital markets for the three year period following this effective date. Through
December 31, 2011, no instruments were issued under this registration statement.  Stock Sale and Equity Distribution Agreement
 In November 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $125 million of the Companys common stock, warrants or debt securities. On August 8, 2008, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) with UBS
Securities, LLC (UBS). The EDA provided that the Company could sell up to an aggregate of $15 million of the Companys common stock from time to time through UBS. In exchange for its services as sales agent, the Company paid UBS a
commission equal to 3.5% of the gross sales price of the shares sold. In April 2009, the Company suspended the EDA program. As of January 2010, the shelf registration statement is no longer effective. 
In May 2009, the Company issued two million shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, through a public offering underwritten by
Roth Capital Partners (Roth), with an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 300,000 shares. In exchange for its services as underwriter, the Company paid Roth a commission of 7% of the gross sales price of the shares sold.
 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company raised $21.0 million through the shelf registration statement and
the EDA. This $21.0 million consists of $18.6 million in cash from the sale of 2.3 million shares, net of offering costs and $2.4 million from the sale of 473,000 shares under the EDA, net of offering costs. 
Equity Incentive Plans  The Company has two active share-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2011: the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and the 2005 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the
Incentive Plan). Under the Incentive Plan, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and 
  70 


Table of Contents

restricted stock units are granted to employees and non-employee directors. Generally, these awards vest over periods of one to four years. In addition, equity awards are issued to senior
management where vesting of the award is tied to Company performance conditions. The Companys policy is to issue new shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options or granting of stock awards to employees. 
The Companys Incentive Plan provides for an equity incentive pool of 2,750,000 shares. Shares reserved for issuance are replenished
by forfeited shares. Additionally, equity awards forfeited under the Companys 1995 stock option plan are added to the total shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for accelerated vesting if there is
a change of control.  Stock-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the tax benefit associated with the exercise of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock
grants, and disqualifying dispositions of both incentive stock options and stock issued under the Companys ESPP, was approximately $2.3 million. No tax benefit was recognized in 2011, 2010 or 2009, because excess tax benefits were not realized
by the Company.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods with a cumulative catch up adjustment if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
Stock Options  In the
first quarter of 2011, the Company ceased granting stock options to its employees as part of its annual equity incentive award program, and began granting restricted stock awards to employees. The Company may grant stock options in the future under
the Incentive Plan.  The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model
with the following weighted-average assumptions:

 The dividend yield is zero because the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention
to pay cash dividends. In addition, over the remaining term of the Credit Facility, which is scheduled to expire in April 2015, the Company is not permitted to declare or pay dividends. The expected term is based on the Companys historical
experience from previous stock option grants. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock measured over a period commensurate with the expected option term. The Company does not consider implied volatility
due to the low volume of publicly traded stock options. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the zero coupon rate on U.S. Treasury instruments with terms comparable to the options expected term.

 The number of shares exercisable at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 884,959, 928,380 and
998,097, respectively, with weighted average exercise prices of $11.14, $10.44 and $9.87, respectively.  The weighted-average
grant date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $9.27 and $5.17 per share, respectively. No stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2011. The total intrinsic value
of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Cash proceeds from option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.3
million.  As of December 31, 2011, there was $1.8 million, or $1.1 million adjusted for estimated forfeitures, of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.  Restricted Stock Awards  In the first quarter of 2011, the Company began
granting restricted stock awards to its employees as part of its annual equity incentive award program, in replacement of stock options which had historically been broadly granted to employees. Generally, vesting of restricted stock awards is
contingent upon a period of service, typically four years. In addition, the Company grants restricted stock awards to senior management with vesting contingent upon specified Company performance conditions. Historically, non-employee directors of
the Company were compensated with restricted stock awards as part of their annual retainer; in 2011, non-employee directors received restricted stock units instead (see below). 
The fair value of each restricted stock award is determined on the date of grant based on the closing stock price. For restricted stock
awards with vesting contingent on Company performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized ratably over the estimate requisite service period, which is based on the estimated achievement date of the performance condition, but not less than
the minimum 12-month vesting period. This requisite service period is determined based on an analysis of the terms and conditions of each grant. The Company uses the requisite service period that is most likely to occur, including the likelihood
that the restricted stock award will not be earned. The initial requisite service period may be adjusted for changes in the expected outcomes of the related performance conditions, with such changes recognized as a true-up adjustment in the
consolidated statement of operations. If actual forfeitures differ from this estimate, a true-up adjustment will be recorded to reflect expense only for those awards that ultimately vest.

 The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awards granted during the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $15.90, $15.71 and $10.91, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the total grant date fair value of service-based restricted stock awards granted was $3.7 million and the total grant date
fair value of performance-based restricted stock awards granted was $695,000.  Share awards released during the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 56,000 and 170,000, respectively. Service-based share awards vested in 2011, 2010 and 2009 had a vest date fair value of $1.0 million, $434,000 and $502,000, respectively. No performance-based share awards vested
in 2011. Performance-based share awards vested in 2010 and 2009 had a vest date fair value of $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was $3.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost, or $2.0 million net of
estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.  Restricted Stock Units  In 2011, the Company
granted non-employee directors of the Company restricted stock unit (RSU) awards as partial consideration for their annual retainer compensation. In addition, historically, non-employee directors were paid a quarterly retainer in RSU
awards. This quarterly retainer has been replaced by an annual compensation plan.  In the first quarter of each fiscal year,
each non-employee director of the Company receives an RSU award for a number of shares determined by dividing $60,000 by the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. These awards vest in full one year from the date of
grant. Each RSU award granted pursuant to this retainer program will be settled and shares issued thereunder on the earliest to occur of (i) the one year anniversary from the date of grant, (ii) 60 days after the directors service
terminates or (iii) the occurrence of a change of control.  The Company determines the fair value on the grant date and
expenses that amount over the requisite service period. The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. The total grant date fair value of service-based restricted stock unit awards granted
during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $420,000. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $19.06, $13.65 and $12.25, respectively.
As of December 31, 2011, there was $46,000 of unrecognized compensation cost, or $38,000 net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
0.1 year.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In 2004, the Company established the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Pursuant to the ESPP, the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be purchased shall not exceed five
hundred 
  73

thousand (500,000) shares of common stock of the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has issued a total of 294,210 shares of common stock from the current ESPP. For the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company issued 44,542 and 44,664 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.  The ESPP
permits substantially all employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, at 85% of the lower of the trading price of the stock at the beginning or at the end of each six-month offering period commencing on January 1 and
July 1. The number of shares purchased is based on participants contributions made during the offering period.  The
fair value of the look back option for ESPP shares issued during the offering period is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model for a call and a put option. The share price used for the model is a 15% discount on the stock
price on the first day of the offering period; the number of shares to be purchased is calculated based on employee contributions, and by using the following weighted-average assumptions:

 The Company has established a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets as evidenced by the cumulative losses from operations through December 31, 2011. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. At such time as
it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly, and recorded as a tax benefit with the exception of $15.5 million which will result in additional paid in
capital as discussed below. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $67.3 million as of December 31, 2011 to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The Company increased its valuation allowance
by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the
Companys federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period.  At December 31, 2011, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $164.6 million and $102.9 million, respectively. The federal tax loss carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2020 and the state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2012. The excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock grants, and disqualifying dispositions of both incentive
stock option stock and stock acquired from the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, for 2011 and 2010 in the amount of $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, did not reduce current income taxes payable and, accordingly, are not
included in the deferred tax asset relating to net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, but are included with the federal and state NOL carryforwards disclosed in this footnote. The tax benefits associated with stock option deductions
from 1998 to 2005 in the amount of $15.5 million were not recorded in additional paid-in capital because their realization was not more likely than not to occur and, consequently, a valuation allowance was recorded against the entire benefit. In
addition, the Company has research and development and other tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2011 of $5.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The federal credits will begin to expire in
2012 unless utilized and the state credits have an indefinite life.

The Company has been granted a tax holiday in Switzerland, which is effective as of
January 1, 2012 and is for 10 years. The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of this tax holiday decreased deferred foreign taxes by $997,000 for 2011. The benefit of the tax
holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $.04, for 2011.  U.S. and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on
the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or
liquidation of the subsidiary. The amount of unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries totaled $12.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on the excess of the
financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation.  Items that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax accounts are as follows (in thousands):

 The Company adopted the provisions of section 740-10 of the Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC on January 1, 2007. Of the total unrecognized benefits at December 31, 2011, approximately $10.0 million was recorded as a reduction to deferred tax assets, which caused a corresponding reduction in the
Companys valuation allowance of $10.0 million. To the extent unrecognized tax benefits are recognized at a time when a valuation allowance does not exist, the recognition of the tax benefit would reduce the effective tax rate. The Company does
not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months.

 The Company recognizes interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. Interest and
penalties for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $37,000 and $14,000, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2009 was zero.  The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years subsequent to 2007 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and its state income tax returns subsequent to 2006 are
subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Companys foreign tax returns subsequent to 2001 are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.  Net operating losses from years from which the statute of limitations have expired (2006 and prior for federal and 2005 and prior for state) could be adjusted in the event that the taxing jurisdictions
challenge the amounts of net operating loss carryforwards from such years. 
Note 11Leases 
Rental expense amounted to $3.1 million, $2.5 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010

Note 12Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
Foreign Plan  The CompensationRetirement Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC requires balance sheet recognition of the total over funded or under funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Under the guidance, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost.  The Companys plan is regulated by the Swiss Government and is funded by the employees and the Company. The pension benefit is based on compensation, length of service and credited investment
earnings. The plan guarantees both a minimum rate of return as well as minimum annuity purchase rates. The Companys funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute the amount required by Swiss law, using the

  78

required percentage applied to the employees compensation. In addition, participating employees are required to contribute to the pension plan. The Company made pension contributions of
$778,000, $635,000 and $589,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 45% of the contributions to the plan are made by the employees. This plan has a measurement date of December 31. The Company does not have any rights to the assets of the
plan.  The reported pension asset increased from $5.3 million to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.
The asset increase is a combination of an actuarial gain due to participant experience, an actuarial loss due to assumption changes, and a higher than expected overall asset return rate which resulted in a gain. 
The accumulated benefit obligation was approximately $25.2 million and $24.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 The following table reflects changes in the pension benefit obligation and plan assets, and the amounts recognized in the

The 2012 expected future long-term rate of return is estimated to be 4.25%, which is based
on historical asset rate of returns for each asset allocation classification at a 1.8% rate for Swiss bonds, 2.0% for unhedged foreign bonds, 1.5% for hedged foreign bonds, 4.3% for real property, 5.6% for Swiss equities, 6.9% for unhedged global
equities, 4.6% for hedge funds and 1.3% for cash. The 2011 expected long-term rate of return was 5.0% and was based on the historical asset rates of return of 1.9% for Swiss bonds, 2.9% for unhedged foreign bonds, 1.3% for hedged foreign bonds, 5.6%
for real property, 7.6% for Swiss equities and 8.4% for global equities, 5.6% for alternative investments and 1.9% for cash.

Investment objectives: 
The primary investment goal of the pension plan is to achieve a total annualized return of 4.25% over the long-term. The investments are
evaluated, compared and benchmarked to plans with similar investment strategies. The plan also attempts to minimize risk by not having any single security or class of securities with a disproportionate impact on the plan. As a guideline, assets are
diversified by asset classes (equity, fixed income, real estate, and alternative investments).  The fair value of the plans
assets at December 31, 2011, by asset category, are as follows:

 U.S. Plan  The Company has postretirement benefit plans covering its employees in the United States. Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to elect coverage under a contributory employee savings plan which
provides for Company matching contributions based on one-half of employee contributions up to certain plan limits. The Companys matching contributions under this plan totaled $415,000, $379,000 and $384,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Note 13Related Party Transactions 
During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Companys Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA, made payments to a
related party, Metar Machines (Metar), for commissions on certain product sales. Until March 22, 2009, Montena SA (Montena) was the majority shareholder of Metar, and a member of the Companys board of directors,
José Cortes, is also a director of Montena. Mr. Cortes is also a minority shareholder of Genturica Ltd., which is the majority shareholder of Montena. As of March 22, 2009, Montena had sold its interest in Metar and as of
May 14, 2009, the Company terminated its agreement with Metar, Therefore, Metar is no longer a related party. Total expense recognized for this sales commission during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $128,000, which is classified as
selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  Maxwell SAs
pension plan provided a long term loan of 700,000 Swiss Francs to Montena Properties SA, which is 100% owned by Montena. As stated earlier, a member of the Companys board of directors, José Cortes, is also a director and indirect
minority stockholder of Montena. The loan was provided to Montena Properties SA prior to Mr. Cortes becoming a director of Maxwell and Montena. The loan was repaid in full in March 2011.

Note 14Legal Proceedings 
Although the Company expects to incur significant legal costs in connection with the below legal proceedings, the
Company is unable to estimate the amount of such legal costs and therefore, such costs will be expensed in the period the legal services are performed.  Customer Claim  In 2005, a customer claimed a possible defect in a
product that was produced for the Companys Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA, under contract by a third party manufacturer, Epcos AG, and resold to the customer. In July 2011, the Company reached an agreement in principal with the customer to
settle any and all claims for consideration of 1.8 million Euro (approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2011), with 500,000 Euro (approximately $648,000 as of December 31, 2011) payable to the customer up front and the
remaining amount of 1.3 million Euro (approximately $1.7 million as of December 31, 2011) available to the customer as a specified discount on future purchases of the Companys products. Any balance remaining of the 1.3 million
Euro not used as product discount by December 31, 2014 is payable in cash at that time. This agreement is not yet final, and is therefore subject to change until a written agreement between the parties is executed. The Company is continuing to
pursue recovery of damages from the manufacturer of the defective product, but at this time is unable to ascertain the amount of the recovery, if any. The anticipated settlement amount of 1.8 million Euro (approximately $2.3 million as of
December 31, 2011) due from the Company to the customer has been fully accrued in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. 
FCPA Matter  As a
result of being a publicly traded company in the U.S., the Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or
keeping business. Beginning in 2009, the Company conducted an internal review into payments made to its former independent sales agent in China with respect to sales of the Companys high voltage capacitor products produced by the
Companys Swiss subsidiary. In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records,
internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the FCPA and other securities law violations. The Company settled civil charges with the SEC, agreeing to an injunction against further violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement with
the SEC, the Company agreed to pay a total of $6.4 million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest, in two installments, with $3.2 million paid in each of the first quarters of 2011 and 2012. Under the terms of the settlement with the DOJ,
the Company agreed to pay a total of $8.0 million in penalties in three installments, with $3.5 million paid in the first quarter of 2011, $2.3 million paid in the first quarter of 2012, and $2.3 million payable in the first quarter of 2013. As part
of the settlement, the Company entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ. If the Company remains in compliance with the terms of the DPA, at the conclusion of the term, the charges against the Company
asserted by the DOJ will be dismissed with prejudice. Further, under the terms of the agreements, the Company will periodically report to the SEC and DOJ on the Companys internal compliance program concerning anti-bribery. As of
December 31, 2011, $5.4 million is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $2.3 million is included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
Shareholder Derivative Suit  In August 2010 and September 2010, two separate shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Superior Court for San Diego County, California, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Company, against
certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors alleging, among other claims, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. In October 2010, these two actions were consolidated, and in
March 2011 a consolidated and amended shareholder derivative complaint was filed bringing similar claims as the previous complaints. The consolidated and amended complaint was titled Loizides v. Schramm et al. and alleged that the individual
defendants failed to prevent the Company from violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and failed to maintain internal controls and accounting systems for compliance with the FCPA. On December 15, 2011, all parties
attended mediation, wherein at the conclusion of the hearing the mediator proposed a settlement amount of $3.0 million to be paid to plaintiffs counsels, with $2.7 million to be 
  83 


Table of Contents

paid by the Companys insurance carrier and $290,000 to be paid by the Company. In addition to the monetary amount and as part of the proposed settlement, the Company would be required to
ensure that certain corporate governance measures are in place and enforced. On February 8, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved these settlement terms. The agreement is subject to, among other things, court approval and notice
to our shareholders. On February 9, 2012, the parties executed a stipulation of settlement, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for court approval of the settlement. On February 14, 2012, the court entered an order that preliminarily approved the
proposed settlement, subject to further consideration at a settlement hearing scheduled for April 12, 2012, which will likely result in a dismissal of the consolidated derivative action with prejudice. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has
accrued a liability of $3.0 million based on the anticipated settlement amount, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a receivable of $2.7 million, which is included in trade and other accounts
receivable, for the amount payable by its insurance carrier.  Customer Bankruptcy Matter 
In January 2011, the Company attended a bankruptcy proceeding for a previous customer in order to bid on certain intellectual property and
physical assets that were being auctioned. During this proceeding, an offer for sale was presented for any and all potential claims held by the previous customer against the Company. These potential claims related primarily to payments made to the
Company prior to the previous customer filing bankruptcy, as well as a potential intellectual property dispute between the Company and the previous customer. At the January 2011 bankruptcy proceeding, the Company bid $250,000 to purchase the right
to any and all future claims against the Company stemming from rights held by the previous customer. However, following the auction, the previous customer essentially declined the previous offer for settlement with the Company. Since this time, in
the interest of a more expedient resolution to this matter, the Company has increased its settlement offer to $500,000. Recently, the parties have been unable to progress with settlement discussions until other matters with the previous
customers estate are resolved with third parties. The Company believes that it has strong legal defenses against any and all potential claims related to this matter, and does not believe a settlement amount in excess of $500,000 is likely. The
Companys current estimate of the range of loss on this matter is $500,000 to $1,000,000, with the low end of this range based on the Companys outstanding settlement offer, and the high end of the range based on the opposing partys
counter offer of $871,000, which only represented the preference payment claim, plus some amount for the intellectual property dispute. The proposed settlement amount of $500,000 has been fully accrued in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.  DCIS Matter 
In 2007, the Company delivered products to two separate customers who were incorporating the Companys products into larger systems
for use by agencies of the U.S. government. In 2008, one of these customers reported intermittent failures in the products delivered to it by the Company and replacement units were provided to that customer. In March 2010, the Company was contacted
by an agent from the Defense Criminal Investigative Services (DCIS) requesting a meeting to discuss the failures that occurred with the Companys products delivered to a specific customer. In April 2011, the DCIS agent contacted the
Company again to request a follow up meeting to ask additional questions. Essentially, the Company believes that the DCIS agent is considering the appropriateness of the Companys actions regarding the discovered product failures and whether
the failure reported by this particular customer would be applicable to another customer to which the same products were delivered. In June 2011, the DCIS served a subpoena on the Company requesting that the Company produce certain documents. In
December 2011, the Company completed its production of documents requested under the subpoena. To date, no formal actions have been taken by DCIS with respect to any documents provided by the Company. Further, the Company has not identified any
documents or facts that appear to indicate any wrongdoing, including, potentially, any violation of laws or regulations. At this time, the Company believes it is remote that it will incur any penalties, fines or other monetary settlements as a
result of this matter, and as such has not accrued any amount associated with this matter. However, given the passage of 
  84

time on this matter and the indeterminate amount of time that this matter could remain open, the Company has determined that there is a reasonable possibility that this matter could have a
material impact on its financial condition. However, based on the stage of this matter, the Company is unable to estimate a range of loss.

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None.   


Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We are committed to maintaining disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2011, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2011.  McGladrey & Pullen LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements of Maxwell in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Maxwells controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 which is
included in this Item under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders  Maxwell Technologies, Inc.  We have audited Maxwell Technologies, Inc.s and
subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Maxwell Technologies, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Maxwell Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report
dated February 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion.  /s/     MCGLADREY &
PULLEN, LLP  San Diego, California  February 16, 2012
