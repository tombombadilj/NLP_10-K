Item 1.
Business  Equity
LifeStyle Properties, Inc.  General  Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership) and its other consolidated subsidiaries (the
Subsidiaries), are referred to herein as the Company and ELS. ELS elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT), for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year
ended December 31, 1993.  The Company is a fully integrated owner and operator of lifestyle-oriented
properties (Properties). The Company leases individual developed areas (sites) with access to utilities for placement of factory built homes, cottages, cabins or recreational vehicles (RVs). Customers may lease
individual sites or enter right-to-use contracts providing the customer access to specific Properties for limited stays. The Company was formed in December 1992 to continue the property operations, business objectives and acquisition strategies of
an entity that had owned and operated Properties since 1969. As of December 31, 2011, the Company owned or had an ownership interest in a portfolio of 382 Properties located throughout the United States and Canada, consisting of 141,132
residential sites. These Properties are located in 32 states and British Columbia (with the number of Properties in each state or province shown parenthetically) as follows: Florida (119), California (49), Arizona (41), Michigan (15), Pennsylvania
(15), Texas (15), Washington (15), Colorado (10), Oregon (9), North Carolina (8), Delaware (7), Indiana (7), Nevada (7), New York (7), Virginia (7), Maine (5), Massachusetts (5), Wisconsin (5), Idaho (4), Illinois (4), Minnesota (4), New Jersey (4),
South Carolina (3), Utah (3), Maryland (2), New Hampshire (2), North Dakota (2), Ohio (2), Tennessee (2), Alabama (1), Connecticut (1), Kentucky (1), and British Columbia (1). 
Properties are designed and improved for several home options of various sizes and designs that are produced off-site,
installed and set on designated sites (Site Set) within the Properties. These homes can range from 400 to over 2,000 square feet. The smallest of these homes are referred to as Resort Cottages. Properties may also have sites
that can accommodate a variety of RVs. Properties generally contain centralized entrances, internal road systems and designated sites. In addition, Properties often provide a clubhouse for social activities and recreation and other amenities, which
may include restaurants, swimming pools, golf courses, lawn bowling, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry facilities and cable television service. In some cases, utilities are provided or arranged for by the Company; otherwise, the customer
contracts for the utility directly. Some Properties provide water and sewer service through municipal or regulated utilities, while others provide these services to customers from on-site facilities. Properties generally are designed to attract
retirees, empty-nesters, vacationers and second home owners; however, certain of the Companys Properties focus on affordable housing for families. The Company focuses on owning properties in or near large metropolitan markets and retirement
and vacation destinations.  Employees and Organizational Structure 
The Company has an annual average of approximately 3,500 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees dedicated to carrying
out its operating philosophy and strategies of value enhancement and service to its customers. The operations of each Property are coordinated by an on-site team of employees that typically includes a manager, clerical staff and maintenance workers,
each of whom works to provide maintenance and care to the Properties. Direct supervision of on-site management is the responsibility of the Companys regional vice presidents and regional and district managers. These individuals have
substantial experience in addressing the needs of customers and in finding or creating innovative approaches to maximize value and increase cash flow from property operations. Complementing this field management staff are approximately 200 full-time
corporate employees who assist on-site and regional management in all property functions.

Table of Contents
Formation of the Company 
The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating Partnership. The Company contributed the
proceeds from its initial public offering in 1993 and subsequent offerings to the Operating Partnership for a general partnership interest. In 2004, the general partnership interest was contributed to MHC Trust, a private REIT subsidiary owned by
the Company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may not be qualifying
REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the Company has formed taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. 
Realty Systems, Inc. (RSI) is a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company that is engaged in the
business of purchasing and selling or leasing Site Set homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by the Company. RSI also provides brokerage services to residents at such Properties who move from a Property but do not relocate their
homes. RSI may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local brokers, by seeking buyers for the Site Set homes. Subsidiaries of RSI also operate ancillary activities at certain Properties, such as golf courses, pro shops, stores and
restaurants. Several Properties are also wholly owned by taxable REIT subsidiaries of the Company.  Business Objectives and Operating
Strategies  The Companys primary business objective is to maximize both current income and long-term
growth in income. The Companys operating strategy is to own and operate the highest quality properties in sought-after locations near urban areas and retirement and vacation destinations across the United States. 
The Company focuses on properties that have strong cash flow and plans to hold such properties for long-term investment
and capital appreciation. In determining cash flow potential, the Company evaluates its ability to attract and retain high quality customers to its Properties who take pride in the Property and in their homes. The Companys investment,
operating and financing strategies include:   


 

 
 Providing consistently high levels of services and amenities in attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and pride of home
ownership;   


 

 
 Efficiently managing the Properties to increase operating margins by controlling expenses, increasing occupancy and maintaining competitive market
rents;   


 

 
 Increasing income and property values by strategic expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties 
 


 

 
 Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor customer
satisfaction;   


 

 
 Selectively acquiring properties that have potential for long-term cash flow growth and creating property concentrations in and around major
metropolitan areas and retirement or vacation destinations to capitalize on operating synergies and incremental efficiencies; and   


 

 
 Managing the Companys debt balances such that the Company maintains financial flexibility, has minimal exposure to interest rate fluctuations
and maintains an appropriate degree of leverage to maximize return on capital.  The Company
focuses on creating an attractive residential environment by providing a well-maintained, comfortable Property with a variety of recreational and social activities and superior amenities, as well as offering a multitude of lifestyle housing choices.
In addition, the Company regularly conducts evaluations of the cost of housing in the marketplaces in which its Properties are located and surveys rental rates of competing properties. From time to time the Company also conducts satisfaction surveys
of its customers to determine the 
  2

factors they consider most important in choosing a property. The Company seeks to improve site utilization and efficiency by tracking types of customers and usage patterns and marketing to those
specific customer groups.  These business objectives and their implementation are determined by the
Companys Board of Directors and may be changed at any time.  Acquisitions and Dispositions 
Over the last decade the Companys portfolio of Properties has grown significantly from 148 owned or partly owned
Properties with over 50,000 sites to 382 owned or partly-owned Properties with over 141,000 sites. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company acquired 75 Properties with over 30,000 sites. The Company continually reviews the
Properties in its portfolio to ensure that they fit the Companys business objectives. Over the last five years, the Company sold 12 Properties, and it redeployed capital to markets it believes have greater long-term potential. In that same
time period the Company acquired 84 Properties located in high growth areas such as Florida, Arizona and California.  The Company believes that opportunities for property acquisitions are still available. Increasing acceptability of and demand for a lifestyle that includes Site Set homes and RVs, as well as continued
constraints on development of new properties, adds to the attractiveness of the Companys Properties as investments. The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the acquisition of additional properties due to its experienced
management, significant presence in major real estate markets and substantial capital resources. The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional properties and is engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition
of a number of properties. At any time these negotiations are at varying stages, which may include contracts outstanding, to acquire certain Properties, which are subject to the satisfactory completion of the Companys due diligence review.
 The Company anticipates that new acquisitions will generally be located in the United States, although it may
consider other geographic locations provided they meet certain acquisition criteria. The Company utilizes market information systems to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, including the use of a market database to review the primary
economic indicators of the various locations in which it expects to expand its operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most appropriate sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from operations, issuance of additional
equity securities, sales of investments, collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in
the Operating Partnership (Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. The Company believes that an ownership structure that includes the Operating Partnership will permit it to acquire additional properties in transactions that
may defer all or a portion of the sellers tax consequences.  When evaluating potential acquisitions, the
Company considers such factors as:   


 

 
 The replacement cost of the property, including land values, entitlements and zoning; 
 


 

 
 The geographic area and type of the property;   


 

 
 The location, construction quality, condition and design of the property; 
 


 

 
 The current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; 
 


 

 
 The potential for capital appreciation of the property; 
 


 

 
 The terms of tenant leases or usage rights, including the potential for rent increases; 
 


 

 
 The potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;
  


 

 
 The potential for expansion of the physical layout of the property and the number of sites; 
  3 


Table of Contents


 

 
 The occupancy and demand by customers for properties of a similar type in the vicinity and the customers profile;
  


 

 
 The prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; and 
 


 

 
 The competition from existing properties and the potential for the construction of new properties in the area. 
When evaluating potential dispositions, the Company considers such factors as: 
 


 

 
 Its ability to sell the Property at a price that it believes will provide an appropriate return for its stockholders; 
 


 

 
 Its desire to exit certain non-core markets and recycle the capital into core markets; and 
 


 

 
 Whether the Property meets its current investment criteria. 
When investing capital, the Company considers all potential uses of the capital, including returning capital to its
stockholders. The Companys Board of Directors continues to review the conditions under which it will repurchase the Companys stock. These conditions include, but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, other
opportunities and capital requirements.  Property Expansions 
Several of the Companys Properties have available land for expanding the number of sites available to be utilized by
its customers. Development of these sites (Expansion Sites) is evaluated based on the following: local market conditions; ability to subdivide; accessibility through the Property or externally; infrastructure needs including utility
needs and access as well as additional common area amenities; zoning and entitlement; costs and uses of working capital; topography; and ability to market new sites. When justified, development of Expansion Sites allows the Company to leverage
existing facilities and amenities to increase the income generated from the Properties. Where appropriate, facilities and amenities may be upgraded or added to certain Properties to make those Properties more attractive in their markets. The
Companys acquisition philosophy includes owning Properties with potential Expansion Site development. Approximately 79 of the Companys Properties have expansion potential, with up to approximately 5,300 acres available for expansion.
 Leases or Usage Rights  At the Companys Properties, a typical lease entered into between the owner or renter of a home and the Company for the rental of a site is for a month-to-month or year-to-year term, renewable upon
the consent of both parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute. These leases are cancelable, depending on applicable law, for non-payment of rent, violation of Property rules and regulations or other specified defaults. Non-cancelable
long-term leases, with remaining terms ranging up to ten years, are in effect at certain sites in 31 of the Properties. Some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in some instances
taking into consideration market conditions, certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass-throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes, utility expenses and capital expenditures. Generally, market rate adjustments, if appropriate, are
made on an annual basis. At Properties zoned for RV use, long-term customers typically enter into rental agreements and many customers prepay for their stays. Many resort customers also leave deposits to reserve a site for the following year.
Generally these customers cannot live full time on the Property. At resort Properties designated for use by customers who have entered a right-to-use or membership contract, the contract generally grants the customer access to designated Properties
on a continuous basis of up to 14 days. The customer may make a nonrefundable upfront payment, and annual dues payments are required to renew the contract. Most of the contracts provide for an annual dues increase, usually based on increases in the
CPI. Approximately 35% of current customers are not subject to annual dues increases in accordance with the terms of their contracts, generally because the customers are over 61 years old or in certain other limited circumstances.

Regulations and Insurance 
General. The Companys Properties are subject to a variety of laws, ordinances and regulations, including
regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas, regulations relating to providing utility services, such as electricity, and regulations relating to operating water and wastewater treatment
facilities at certain of its Properties. The Company believes that each Property has all material permits and approvals necessary to operate.  Rent Control Legislation. At certain of the Companys Properties, principally in California, state and local rent control laws limit the Companys ability to increase rents and to recover
increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions. The Company presently expects to continue to maintain Properties, and may purchase additional
properties, in markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be enacted. For example, Florida has enacted a law requiring that rental increases be reasonable. Also, certain jurisdictions in
California in which the Company owns Properties limit rent increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage of it. As part of the Companys effort to realize the value of Properties subject to restrictive regulation, it has initiated lawsuits
against several municipalities imposing such regulations in an attempt to balance the interests of its stockholders with the interests of its customers (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings). Further, at certain of the Companys
Properties primarily used as membership campgrounds, state statutes limit the Companys ability to close a Property unless a reasonable substitute property is made available for members use. Many states also have consumer protection laws
regulating right-to-use or campground membership sales and the financing of such sales. Some states have laws requiring the Company to register with a state agency and obtain a permit to market (see Item 1A. Risk Factors).
 Insurance. The Properties are insured against all risks causing property damage and business
interruption caused by fire, flood, earthquake, or windstorm, and the relevant insurance policies contain various deductible requirements, such as coverage limits and particular exclusions. The Companys current property and casualty insurance
policies, which it plans to renew, expire on April 1, 2012. The Company has a $100 million loss limit with respect to its all-risk property insurance program including named windstorms, which include, for example, hurricanes. This loss limit is
subject to additional sub-limits as set forth in the policy form, including, among others, a $25 million loss limit for an earthquake in California. Policy deductibles primarily range from a $125,000 minimum to 5% per unit of insurance for most
catastrophic events. A deductible indicates ELS maximum exposure, subject to policy sub-limits, in the event of a loss. 
INDUSTRY  The Company believes that modern properties similar to its Properties provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. These may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates
and rents, as well as expense controls, expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic acquisitions, for the following reasons:   


 

 
 Barriers to Entry: The Company believes that the supply of new properties in locations targeted by the Company will be constrained by
barriers to entry. The most significant barrier has been the difficulty of securing zoning permits from local authorities. This has been the result of (i) the publics historically poor perception of manufactured housing, and (ii) the
fact that properties generate less tax revenue than conventional housing properties because the homes are treated as personal property (a benefit to the homeowner) rather than real property. Another factor that creates substantial barriers to entry
is the length of time between investment in a propertys development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues. The initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or three years. Once a property is
ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to attract customers to an empty property. Substantial occupancy levels may take several years to achieve. 
  5 


Table of Contents


 

 
 Industry Consolidation: According to various industry reports, there are approximately 50,000 manufactured home properties and approximately
8,750 RV properties (excluding government owned properties) in North America. Most of these properties are not operated by large owner/operators, and of the RV properties approximately 1,300 contain 200 sites or more. The Company believes that this
relatively high degree of fragmentation provides the Company, as a national organization with experienced management and substantial financial resources, the opportunity to purchase additional properties as evidenced by the acquisitions during the
year ended December 31, 2011.   


 

 
 Customer Base: The Company believes that properties tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors:
(i) customers typically own their own homes, (ii) properties tend to foster a sense of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses and recreational and social activities, (iii) since moving a Site Set home from one property
to another involves substantial cost and effort, customers often sell their homes in-place (similar to site-built residential housing) with no interruption of rental payments to the Company. 
 


 

 
 Lifestyle Choice: According to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA), nearly one in ten U.S. vehicle-owning
households owns an RV and there are 8.9 million current RV owners. The 77 million people born from 1946 to 1964 or baby boomers make up the fastest growing segment of this market. According to U.S. Census figures, every day
10,000 Americans turn 50. The Company believes that this population segment, seeking an active lifestyle, will provide opportunities for future cash flow growth for the Company. Current RV owners, once finished with the more active RV lifestyle,
will often seek more permanent retirement or vacation establishments. Site Set housing has become an increasingly popular housing alternative for retirement, second-home, and empty-nest living. According to U.S. Census figures, the
baby-boom generation will constitute almost 17% of the U.S. population within the next 20 years. Among those individuals who are nearing retirement (age 46 to 64), approximately 47% plan on moving upon retirement. 
The Company believes that the housing choices in its Properties are especially attractive to such individuals throughout
this lifestyle cycle. The Companys Properties offer an appealing amenity package, close proximity to local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure environment. In fact, many of the Companys Properties allow for this
cycle to occur within a single Property.   


 

 
 Construction Quality: Since 1976, all factory built housing has been required to meet stringent federal standards, resulting in significant
increases in quality. The Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) standards for Site Set housing construction quality are the only federal standards governing housing quality of any type in the United States. Site Set
homes produced since 1976 have received a red and silver government seal certifying that they were built in compliance with the federal code. The code regulates Site Set home design and construction, strength and durability, fire
resistance and energy efficiency, and the installation and performance of heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. In newer homes, top grade lumber and dry wall materials are common. Also, manufacturers are required to
follow the same fire codes as builders of site-built structures. In addition, although Resort Cottages do not come under the same regulations, many of the manufacturers of Site Set homes also produce Resort Cottages with many of the same quality
standards.   


 

 
 Comparability to Site-Built Homes: The Site Set housing industry has experienced a trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern Site Set
homes are longer (up to 80 feet, compared to 50 feet in the 1960s) and wider than earlier models. Many such homes have nine-foot ceilings or vaulted ceilings, fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms and closely resemble single-family
ranch-style site-built homes. At the Companys Properties, there is an active resale market for these larger homes.   


 

 
 Second Home Demographics: According to 2011 National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports, sales of second homes in 2010
accounted for 27% of residential transactions, or 1.41 million second-home sales in 2010. There were approximately 7.9 million vacation homes in 2010. The typical vacation-home buyer is 49 years old and earned $99,500 in 2010. According to
2010 NAR reports, 
  6 


Table of Contents


 
 
approximately 32% of vacation homes were purchased in the south; 24% were purchased in the west; 21% were purchased in the northeast; and 20% were purchased in the Midwest. In looking ahead, NAR
believes that baby boomers are still in their peak earning years, and the leading edge of their generation is approaching retirement. As they continue to have the financial wherewithal to purchase a second home as a vacation property, investment
opportunity, or perhaps as a retirement retreat, those baby boomers will continue to drive the market for second homes. The Company believes it is likely that over the next decade it will continue to see historically high levels of second-home
sales, and resort homes and cottages in its Properties will continue to provide a viable second-home alternative to site-built homes.  Notwithstanding the Companys belief that the industry information highlighted above provides the Company with significant long-term growth opportunities, its short-term growth opportunities could be
disrupted by the following:   


 

 
 ShipmentsAccording to statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, shipments of new manufactured homes declined from 2005 through
2009. Shipments for 2010 as compared to 2009 were flat. Although new manufactured home shipments continue to be below historical levels, shipments for the first eleven months in 2011 increased over 1% to 47,800 units as compared to shipments for the
first eleven months in 2010 of 47,300 units. According to the RVIA, wholesale shipments of RVs increased 4.1% in 2011 to 252,300 units as compared to 2010, which continued a positive trend in RV shipments that started in late 2009. Certain industry
experts have predicted that 2012 RV shipments will decrease 4.6%, as compared to 2011, to 240,600.

 SalesRetail sales of RVs increased almost 4% to 182,400 for the first 11 months of 2011, as compared to 175,600 the first 11 months of
2010. A total of 183,200 RVs were sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, representing an increase of almost 8% over the prior year. The Company believes that consumers remain concerned about the current economy, and by prospects that the
economy might remain sluggish in the years ahead. However, the enduring appeal of the RV lifestyle has translated into continued strength in RV sales despite the economic turmoil. According to RVIA, RV ownership has reached record levels:
8.9 million American households now own an RV, the highest level ever recorded, which constitutes an increase of 16% since 2001 and 64% since 1980. RV sales could continue to benefit as aging baby-boomers continue to enter the age range in
which RV ownership is highest.

 Availability of financingThe current credit crisis has made it difficult for manufactured home and RV manufacturers to obtain floor
plan financing and for potential customers to obtain loans for manufactured home or RV purchases. Further, legislation enacted in 2010 known as the SAFE Act (Safe Mortgage Licensing Act) requires community owners interested in financing customer
purchases of manufactured homes to register as a mortgage loan originator in states in which they engage in such financing. These requirements are generally more burdensome for lenders financing the purchase of manufactured homes than for lenders
financing the purchase of site-built homes. In addition, as compared to financing available to owners and purchasers of site-built single family homes, available financing for a manufactured home involves higher down payments, higher FICO scores,
higher interest rates and shorter maturity. Certain government stimulus packages have also provided government guarantees for site-built single family home loans, thereby increasing the supply of financing for that market.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors  The Companys
Performance and Common Stock Value Are Subject to Risks Associated With the Real Estate Industry.  Adverse Economic
Conditions and Other Factors Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Companys Properties and the Companys Cash Flow. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of the Companys Properties. These
factors include:   


 

 
 changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; 
  8 


Table of Contents


 

 
 local conditions such as an oversupply of lifestyle-oriented properties or a reduction in demand for lifestyle-oriented properties in the area, the
attractiveness of the Companys Properties to customers, competition from manufactured home communities and other lifestyle-oriented properties and alternative forms of housing (such as apartment buildings and site-built single family homes);
  


 

 
 the ability of manufactured home and RV manufacturers to adapt to changes in the economic climate and the availability of units from these
manufacturers;   


 

 
 the ability of the Companys potential customers to sell or lease their existing site-built residences in order to purchase resort homes or
cottages in the Companys Properties, and heightened price sensitivity for seasonal and second homebuyers;   


 

 
 the possible reduced ability of the Companys potential customers to obtain financing on the purchase of resort homes, resort cottages or RVs;
  


 

 
 performance of chattel loans purchased in connection with the Acquisition (see Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Acquisition);   


 

 
 government stimulus intended to primarily benefit purchasers of site-built housing; 
 


 

 
 fluctuations in the availability and price of gasoline, especially for the Companys transient customers; 
 


 

 
 the Companys ability to collect rent, annual payments and principal and interest from customers and pay or control maintenance, insurance and
other operating costs (including real estate taxes), which could increase over time;   


 

 
 the failure of the Companys assets to generate income sufficient to pay its expenses, service its debt and maintain its Properties, which may
adversely affect the Companys ability to make expected distributions to its stockholders;   


 

 
 the Companys inability to meet mortgage payments on any Property that is mortgaged, in which case the lender could foreclose on the mortgage
and take the Property;   


 

 
 interest rate levels and the availability of financing, which may adversely affect the Companys financial condition;
  


 

 
 changes in laws and governmental regulations (including rent control laws and regulations governing usage, zoning and taxes), which may adversely
affect the Companys financial condition;   


 

 
 poor weather, especially on holiday weekends in the summer, which could reduce the economic performance of the Companys Northern resort
Properties; and   


 

 
 the Companys ability to sell new or upgraded right-to-use contracts and to retain customers who have previously purchased a right-to-use
contract.  New Acquisitions May Fail to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result
in Increased Prices for Properties. The Company intends to continue to acquire properties. Newly acquired Properties may fail to perform as expected. The Company may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards
established for its intended market position. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. Additionally, the Company expects that other real estate investors with significant
capital will compete with it for attractive investment opportunities. These competitors include publicly traded REITs, private REITs and other types of investors. Such competition increases prices for properties. The Company expects to acquire
properties with cash from secured or unsecured financings, proceeds from offerings of equity or debt, undistributed funds from operations and sales of investments. The Company may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make
suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms.  The intended benefits of the Companys acquisition of a portfolio
of 74 manufactured home communities and one RV resort during the year ended December 31, 2011 may not be realized, which could have a negative impact on the market price of the Companys common stock.

Table of Contents
The acquisition poses risks for our ongoing operations, including that: 
 


 

 
 senior managements attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the acquisition portfolio;
  


 

 
 costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; 
 


 

 
 the acquisition portfolio may not perform as well as the Company anticipates; and 
 


 

 
 unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating the acquisition portfolio into the Companys portfolio. 
As a result of the foregoing, the Company cannot assure you that these acquisitions will be accretive to it in the near term or at all.
Furthermore, if the Company fails to realize the intended benefits of the acquisition, the market price of its common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects those benefits. 
Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, The Company May Not be Able to Sell Properties When Appropriate. Real estate
investments generally cannot be sold quickly. The Company may not be able to vary its portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions, forcing the Company to accept lower than market value. This inability to respond promptly to
changes in the performance of the Companys investments could adversely affect its financial condition and ability to service debt and make distributions to its stockholders. 
Some Potential Losses Are Not Covered by Insurance. The Company carries comprehensive insurance coverage for losses resulting from
property damage, environmental, liability claims and business interruption on all of its Properties. In addition the Company carries liability coverage for other activities not specifically related to property operations. These coverages include,
but are not limited to, Directors & Officers liability, Employer Practices liability and Fiduciary liability. The Company believes that the policy specifications and coverage limits of these policies should be adequate and appropriate.
There are, however, certain types of losses, such as lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of coverage limits occur, the Company could lose all or a portion of the capital it has
invested in a Property or the anticipated future revenue from a Property. In such an event, the Company might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the Property. 
The Companys current property and casualty insurance policies, which it plans to renew, expire on April 1, 2012. The Company
has a $100 million loss limit with respect to its all-risk property insurance program including named windstorms, which include, for example, hurricanes. This loss limit is subject to additional sub-limits as set forth in the policy form, including,
among others, a $25 million loss limit for an earthquake in California. Policy deductibles primarily range from a $125,000 minimum to 5% per unit of insurance for most catastrophic events. A deductible indicates ELS maximum exposure,
subject to policy sub-limits, in the event of a loss.  There can be no assurance that the actions of the U.S. government,
Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies instituted for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets, or market response to those actions, will achieve the intended effect, and the Companys business may not benefit from
or may be adversely impacted by these actions, and further government or market developments could adversely impact the Company. In response to market disruptions, legislators and financial regulators implemented a number of mechanisms designed
to add stability to the financial markets, including the provision of direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions, assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker-dealers,
implementation of programs by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and temporary prohibitions on short sales of certain financial institution securities. Numerous actions have been taken by the Federal Reserve,
Congress, U.S. Treasury, SEC and others to address the liquidity and credit crisis that followed the sub-prime crisis that commenced in 2007. It is not clear at this time what long-term impact the liquidity and funding initiatives of the Federal
Reserve and other agencies that have been previously announced, and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future, will have on the 
  10 


Table of Contents

financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced, or on the U.S. banking and financial industries and the broader U.S. and
global economies. Specifically, the Company believes that programs intended to provide relief to current or potential site-built or stick-built single family homeowners, and not purchasers of Site-Set homes who lease the underlying land and
RVs, negatively impacts its business.  Further, the overall effects of the legislative and regulatory
efforts on the financial markets is uncertain, and they may not have the intended stabilization effects. Should these legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, the Companys business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Even if legislative or regulatory initiatives or other efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, the Company may
need to modify its strategies, businesses or operations, and the Company may incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment. It
is uncertain what effects recently enacted or future legislation or regulatory initiatives will have on us. 
Given the volatile nature of the current market disruption and the uncertainties underlying efforts to mitigate or
reverse the disruption, the Company may not timely anticipate or manage existing, new or additional risks, contingencies or developments, including regulatory developments and trends in new products and services, in the current or future
environment. The Companys failure to do so could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  The Companys 8.034% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Has Not Been Rated. The Company has not sought to obtain a rating for its 8.034% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock). No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not
adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company may elect in the future to obtain a rating of its Series A Preferred Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of its Series A
Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward, placed on a watch list or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if in its
judgment circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision, placing on a watch list or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
Adverse changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect the Companys business. 
The Companys success is dependent upon economic conditions in the U.S. generally and in the geographic areas in which a substantial
number of the Companys Properties are located. Adverse changes in national economic conditions and in the economic conditions of the regions in which the Company conducts substantial business may have an adverse effect on the real estate
values of the Companys Properties, its financial performance and the market price of its common stock.  In a recession
or under other adverse economic conditions, non-earning assets and write-downs are likely to increase as debtors fail to meet their payment obligations. Although the Company maintains reserves for credit losses and an allowance for doubtful accounts
in amounts that it believes should be sufficient to provide adequate protection against potential write-downs in its portfolio, these amounts could prove to be insufficient.  Campground Membership Properties Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect the Value of Certain Properties and the Companys Cash Flow. 
Many of the states in which the Company does business have laws regulating right-to-use or campground membership sales. These laws
generally require comprehensive disclosure to prospective purchasers, and usually give purchasers the right to rescind their purchase between three to five days after the date of sale. Some states

  11 


Table of Contents

have laws requiring the Company to register with a state agency and obtain a permit to market. The Company is subject to changes, from time to time, in the application or interpretation of such
laws that can affect its business or the rights of its members.  In some states, including California, Oregon and Washington,
laws place limitations on the ability of the owner of a campground property to close the property unless the customers at the property receive access to a comparable property. The impact of the rights of customers under these laws is uncertain and
could adversely affect the availability or timing of sale opportunities or the ability of the Company to realize recoveries from Property sales.  The government authorities regulating the Companys activities have broad discretionary power to enforce and interpret the statutes and regulations that they administer, including the power to enjoin
or suspend sales activities, require or restrict construction of additional facilities and revoke licenses and permits relating to business activities. The Company monitors its sales and marketing programs and debt collection activities to control
practices that might violate consumer protection laws and regulations or give rise to consumer complaints.  Certain consumer
rights and defenses that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may affect the Companys portfolio of contracts receivable. Examples of such laws include state and federal consumer credit and truth-in-lending laws requiring the disclosure of
finance charges, and usury and retail installment sales laws regulating permissible finance charges.  In certain states, as a
result of government regulations and provisions in certain of the right-to-use or campground membership agreements, the Company is prohibited from selling more than ten memberships per site. At the present time, these restrictions do not preclude
the Company from selling memberships in any state. However, these restrictions may limit the Companys ability to utilize Properties for public usage and/or the Companys ability to convert sites to more profitable or predictable uses,
such as annual rentals.  Debt Financing, Financial Covenants and Degree of Leverage Could Adversely Affect the Companys Economic
Performance.  Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect the Companys Financial Condition. The
Companys business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing. The total principal amount of the Companys outstanding indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. The Companys
substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving its indebtedness could have important consequences, including the risks that:   


 

 
 the Companys cash flow could be insufficient to pay distributions at expected levels and meet required payments of principal and interest;
  


 

 
 the Company might be required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay its indebtedness, thereby reducing the
availability of its cash flow to fund the implementation of its business strategy, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; 
 


 

 
 the Companys debt service obligations could limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in
which it operates;   


 

 
 the Company may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness (which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity)
and, if it can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;   


 

 
 if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such as new equity
capital, the Companys cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt; and 
  12 


Table of Contents


 

 
 if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
loans) result in higher interest rates, increased interest expense would adversely affect cash flow and the Companys ability to service debt and make distributions to stockholders. 
Ability to obtain mortgage financing or to refinance maturing mortgages may adversely affect the Companys financial
condition. Lenders demands on borrowers as to the quality of the collateral and related cash flows may make it challenging to secure financing at all or on attractive terms. If financing proceeds are no longer available for any reason or if
terms are no longer attractive, these factors may adversely affect cash flow and the Companys ability to service debt and make distributions to stockholders.  Financial Covenants Could Adversely Affect the Companys Financial Condition. If a Property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and the Company is unable to meet mortgage payments,
the mortgagee could foreclose on the Property, resulting in loss of income and asset value. The mortgages on the Companys Properties contain customary negative covenants, which among other things limit the Companys ability, without the
prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the Property and to discontinue insurance coverage. In addition, the Companys unsecured credit facilities contain certain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the
Companys ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt-to-assets ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Foreclosure on mortgaged Properties or an inability to refinance existing
indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The
Companys Degree of Leverage Could Limit Its Ability to Obtain Additional Financing. The Companys debt-to-market-capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage of total debt plus the market value of the outstanding common stock and
Units held by parties other than the Company) was approximately 43% as of December 31, 2011. The degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders, including an adverse effect on the Companys ability to obtain
additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, and makes the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. 
The Company may be able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase the risks associated with its substantial leverage.
Despite the Companys current indebtedness levels, it may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future. If new debt is added to the Companys current debt levels, an even greater portion of its cash flow will be needed
to satisfy its debt service obligations. As a result, the related risks that we now face could intensify and increase the risk of a default on the Companys indebtedness.  The Company Depends on Its Subsidiaries Dividends and Distributions. 
Substantially all of the Companys assets are indirectly held through the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Company has no
source of operating cash flow other than from distributions from the Operating Partnership. The Companys ability to pay dividends to holders of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock depends on the Operating Partnerships ability first
to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and then to make distributions to MHC Trust and common Unit holders (in the case of common stock distributions). Similarly, MHC Trust must satisfy its obligations to its creditors (preferred stockholders
in the case of common stock distributions) before making common stock or preferred stock distributions to the Company.  Stockholders
Ability to Effect Changes of Control of the Company is Limited.  Provisions of the Companys Charter and Bylaws
Could Inhibit Changes of Control. Certain provisions of the Companys charter and bylaws may delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or other transactions that could provide its stockholders with a premium over the
then-prevailing market price of their common stock or Series A Preferred Stock or which might otherwise be in the best interest of its stockholders. These include the 
  13 


Table of Contents

Ownership Limit described below. Also, any future series of preferred stock may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be beneficial to the Companys stockholders.  Maryland Law Imposes Certain
Limitations on Changes of Control. Certain provisions of Maryland law prohibit business combinations (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of
outstanding common stock, or with an affiliate of the Company who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock (an Interested
Stockholder), or with an affiliate of an Interested Stockholder. These prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder. After the five-year period, a business
combination with an Interested Stockholder must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes unless, among other conditions, the Companys common stockholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in
cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested Stockholder for its shares of common stock. The Board of Directors has exempted from these provisions under the Maryland law any business combination with Samuel Zell, who is the
Chairman of the Board of the Company, certain holders of Units who received them at the time of the Companys initial public offering, the General Motors Hourly Rate Employees Pension Trust and the General Motors Salaried Employees Pension
Trust, and the Companys officers who acquired common stock at the time the Company was formed and each and every affiliate of theirs.  The Company Has a Stock Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes. To remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of the Companys outstanding
shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs) at any time during the last half of any taxable year. To facilitate maintenance of the
Companys REIT qualification, the Companys charter, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits Beneficial Ownership (as defined in the Companys charter) by any single stockholder of more than 5% (in value or number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of the Companys outstanding capital stock. The Company refers to this as the Ownership Limit. Within certain limits, the Companys charter permits the Board of Directors to increase the Ownership
Limit with respect to any class or series of stock. The Board of Directors, upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS, opinion of counsel, or other evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors and upon 15 days prior written notice of a proposed
transfer which, if consummated, would result in the transferee owning shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, and upon such other conditions as the Board of Directors may direct, may exempt a stockholder from the Ownership Limit. Absent any such
exemption, capital stock acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred by operation of law to the Company as trustee for the benefit of the person to whom such capital stock is ultimately transferred, and the
stockholders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. Such stockholder would be entitled to receive, from the proceeds of any subsequent sale of the capital stock transferred to the Company as trustee, the lesser of (i) the
price paid for the capital stock or, if the owner did not pay for the capital stock (for example, in the case of a gift, devise on other such transaction), the market price of the capital stock on the date of the event causing the capital stock to
be transferred to the Company as trustee or (ii) the amount realized from such sale. A transfer of capital stock may be void if it causes a person to violate the Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control of
the Company and, therefore, could adversely affect its stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their common stock or adversely affect the best interest of the Companys stockholders. 
Conflicts of Interest Could Influence the Companys Decisions.  Certain Stockholders Could Exercise Influence in a Manner Inconsistent With the Stockholders Best Interests. As of December 31, 2011, Mr. Samuel Zell and certain affiliated holders
beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the Companys outstanding common stock (in each case including common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the exchange of Units). Mr. Zell is the chairman of the Companys
Board of Directors. Accordingly, Mr. Zell has significant influence on the Companys management and operation. Such influence 
  14 


Table of Contents

could be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders.  Mr. Zell and His Affiliates Continue to be Involved in Other Investment Activities. Mr. Zell and his affiliates have a broad and varied range of investment interests, including interests
in other real estate investment companies involved in other forms of housing, including multifamily housing. Mr. Zell and his affiliates may acquire interests in other companies. Mr. Zell may not be able to control whether any such company
competes with the Company. Consequently, Mr. Zells continued involvement in other investment activities could result in competition to the Company as well as management decisions which might not reflect the interests of the Companys
stockholders.  Members of Management May Have a Conflict of Interest Over Whether To Enforce Terms of
Mr. McAdamss Employment and Noncompetition Agreement. Mr. McAdams was the Companys President until January 31, 2011 and had an employment and noncompetition agreement with the Company that expired on December 31,
2010. For the most part these restrictions apply to him both during his employment and for two years thereafter. Mr. McAdams is also prohibited from otherwise disrupting or interfering with the Companys business through the solicitation
of the Companys employees or customers or otherwise. To the extent that the Company chooses to enforce its rights under any of these agreements, it may determine to pursue available remedies, such as actions for damages or injunctive relief,
less vigorously than the Company otherwise might because of its desire to maintain its ongoing relationship with Mr. McAdams. Additionally, the non-competition provisions of his agreement, despite being limited in scope and duration, could be
difficult to enforce, or may be subject to limited enforcement, should litigation arise over it in the future. (See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.) 
Risk of Eminent Domain and Tenant Litigation.  The Company owns Properties in certain areas of the country where real estate values have increased faster than rental rates in its Properties either because of locally imposed rent control or long term
leases. In such areas, the Company has learned that certain local government entities have investigated the possibility of seeking to take the Companys Properties by eminent domain at values below the value of the underlying land. While no
such eminent domain proceeding has been commenced, and the Company would exercise all of its rights in connection with any such proceeding, successful condemnation proceedings by municipalities could adversely affect its financial condition.
Moreover, certain of its Properties located in California are subject to rent control ordinances, some of which not only severely restrict ongoing rent increases but also prohibit the Company from increasing rents upon turnover. Such regulations
allow customers to sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted rent-controlled rents. As part of the Companys effort to realize the value of its Properties subject to rent control, the Company has initiated
lawsuits against several municipalities in California. In response to the Companys efforts, tenant groups have filed lawsuits against the Company seeking not only to limit rent increases, but to be awarded large damage awards. If the Company
is unsuccessful in its efforts to challenge rent control ordinances, it is likely that the Company will not be able to charge rents that reflect the intrinsic value of the affected Properties. Finally, tenant groups in non-rent controlled markets
have also attempted to use litigation as a means of protecting themselves from rent increases reflecting the rental value of the affected Properties. An unfavorable outcome in the tenant group lawsuits could have an adverse impact on the
Companys financial condition.  Environmental and Utility-Related Problems Are Possible and Can be Costly. 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation
and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.
Even if more than one person 
  15 


Table of Contents

may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue
the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. 
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of property
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed
during renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose fines and penalties on real property owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for
personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.  Utility-related laws and regulations also govern the provision
of utility services and operations of water and wastewater treatment facilities. Such laws regulate, for example, how and to what extent owners or operators of property can charge renters for provision of, for example, electricity, and whether and
to what extent such utility services can be charged separately from the base rent. Such laws also regulate the operations and performance of water treatment facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. Such laws may impose fines and penalties on
real property owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements.  The Company has a Significant Concentration of Properties in
Florida and California, and Natural Disasters or Other Catastrophic Events in These or Other States Could Adversely Affect the Value of Its Properties and the Its Cash Flow. 
As of December 31, 2011, the Company owned or had an ownership interest in 382 Properties located in 32 states and British Columbia,
including 119 Properties located in Florida and 49 Properties located in California. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in any of these areas may cause a sudden decrease in the value of the Companys Properties.
While the Company has obtained insurance policies providing certain coverage against damage from fire, flood, property damage, earthquake, wind storm and business interruption, these insurance policies contain coverage limits, limits on covered
property and various deductible amounts that the Company must pay before insurance proceeds are available. Such insurance may therefore be insufficient to restore the Companys economic position with respect to damage or destruction to its
Properties caused by such occurrences. Moreover, each of these coverages must be renewed every year and there is the possibility that all or some of the coverages may not be available at a reasonable cost. In addition, in the event of such a natural
disaster or other catastrophic event, the process of obtaining reimbursement for covered losses, including the lag between expenditures incurred by the Company and reimbursements received from the insurance providers, could adversely affect the
Companys economic performance.  Market Interest Rates May Have an Effect on the Value of the Companys Common Stock.
 One of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the
distribution rates with respect to such shares (as a percentage of the price of such shares) relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher
interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for the Company to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase its borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause
the market price of the Companys publicly traded securities to go down.  The Company Is Dependent on External Sources of Capital.
 To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income
(determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain). In addition, the Company intends to distribute all or substantially all of its net income so that it will generally not be

  16 


Table of Contents

subject to U.S. federal income tax on its earnings. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that the Company will be able to fund all future capital needs, including for
acquisitions, from income from operations. The Company therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of debt and equity capital financing, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. The Companys access to third-party
sources of capital depends on a number of things, including conditions in the capital markets generally and the markets perception of its growth potential and its current and potential future earnings. It may be difficult for the Company to
meet one or more of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, including but not limited to its distribution requirement. Moreover, additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests, and additional
debt financing may substantially increase the Companys leverage.  The Companys Qualification as a REIT is Dependent on
Compliance With U.S. Federal Income Tax Requirements.  The Company believes it has been organized and operated in a manner
so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and it intends to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, however, is governed by highly technical
and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. In connection with certain transactions, the Company has received, and relied upon, advice of counsel as to the impact of such
transactions on its qualification as a REIT. The Companys qualification as a REIT requires analysis of various facts and circumstances that may not be entirely within its control, and it cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service (the IRS) will agree with its analysis or the analysis of its tax counsel. In particular, the proper federal income tax treatment of right-to-use membership contracts is uncertain and there is no assurance that the IRS will agree
with the Companys treatment of such contracts. If the IRS were to disagree with the Companys analysis or its tax counsels analysis of various facts and circumstances, the Companys ability to qualify as a REIT could be
adversely affected. Such matters could affect the Companys qualification as a REIT. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the
requirements for qualification as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of qualification as a REIT.  If, with
respect to any taxable year, the Company failed to maintain the Companys qualification as a REIT (and if specified relief provisions under the Code were not applicable to such disqualification), it could not deduct distributions to
stockholders in computing its net taxable income and it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net taxable income at regular corporate rates. Any U.S. federal income tax payable could include applicable alternative minimum tax. If the
Company had to pay U.S. federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and the Company would no longer be required to distribute money to
stockholders. In addition, the Company would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless it was entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.
Although the Company currently intends to operate in a manner designed to allow the Company to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause it to revoke the REIT election. 
Interpretation of and Changes to Accounting Policies and Standards Could Adversely Affect the Companys Reported Financial Results.
 The Companys Accounting Policies and Methods Are the Basis on Which It Reports Its Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, and They May Require Management to Make Estimates About Matters that Are Inherently Uncertain. The Companys accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the manner in which it records and reports its financial
condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect
managements judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or
more alternatives, any of which might be

reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. 
Changes in Accounting Standards Could Adversely Affect The Companys Reported Financial Results. The bodies that set
accounting standards for public companies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and others, periodically change or revise existing interpretations of the accounting and reporting standards that govern the
way that the Company reports its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact the Companys reported financial results. In some cases, the Company could be
required to apply a new or revised accounting standard, or a revised interpretation of an accounting standard, retroactively, which could have a negative impact on reported results or result in the restatement of the Companys financial
statements for prior periods.  The Companys Accounting Policies for the Entering Right-To-Use Contracts Will Result
in a Substantial Deferral of Revenue in its Financial Results. Beginning August 14, 2008, the Company began entering right-to-use contracts. Customers who enter upgraded right-to-use contracts are generally required to make an upfront
nonrefundable payment to the Company. The Company incurs significant selling and marketing expenses to originate the right-to-use contracts, and the majority of expenses must be expensed in the period incurred, while the related revenues and
commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the expected life of the contract, which is estimated based upon historical attrition rates. The expected life of a right-to-use contract is currently estimated to be between one and 31 years.
As a result, the Company may incur a loss from entering right-to-use contracts, build up a substantial deferred revenue liability balance, and recognize substantial non-cash revenue in the years subsequent to originally entering the contracts. This
accounting may make it difficult for investors to interpret the financial results from the entry of right-to-use contracts. In 2008, the Company submitted correspondence to the Office of the Chief Accountant at the SEC describing the right-to-use
contracts and subsequently discussed the revenue recognition policy with respect to the contracts with the SEC. The SEC does not object to the Companys application of the Codification Topic Revenue Recognition (FASB ASC
605) with respect to the deferral of the upfront nonrefundable payments received from the entry of right-to-use contracts. (See Note 2(n) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for the Companys
revenue recognition policy.)

Properties  General 
The Companys Properties provide attractive amenities and common facilities that create a comfortable and attractive home for its
customers, with most offering a clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television service. Many also offer additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses, tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts, exercise rooms
and various social activities such as concerts. Since most of the Companys customers generally rent its sites on a long-term basis, it is their responsibility to maintain their homes and the surrounding area. It is the Companys role to
ensure that customers comply with its Property policies and to provide maintenance of the common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company holds periodic meetings with its Property management personnel for training and implementation of its
strategies. The Properties historically have had, and the Company believes they will continue to have, low turnover and high occupancy rates. 
Property Portfolio  As
of December 31, 2011, the Company owned or had an ownership interest in a portfolio of 382 Properties located throughout the United States and British Columbia containing 141,132 residential sites.

Table of Contents
The distribution of the Companys Properties throughout the United States reflects its
belief that geographic diversification helps to insulate the portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new acquisitions in or near markets where its Properties are located and will also consider acquisitions of
Properties outside such markets. (Refer to Note 2(c) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)  Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida, and Viewpoint, located in Mesa, Arizona, the Companys two largest properties as determined by property operating revenues, each accounted for approximately
2.0% of its total property operating revenues, including deferrals, for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The following
table sets forth certain information relating to the Properties the Company owned as of December 31, 2011, categorized according to major markets and excluding Properties owned through joint ventures.

this Form 10-K.) 


(c)

Properties with expansion sites noted may have vacancy and therefore, expansion sites may not be added.

(1)
 New activity
starting on August 14, 2008 due to the acquisition of the operations of Privileged Access, LP (Privileged Access). 


(2) 
 Between November 10, 2004 and August 13, 2008, Income from other investments, net included rental income from the lease of membership
Properties to Thousand Trails (TT) or its subsequent owner, Privileged Access. On August 14, 2008, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Privileged Access, which included the operations of
TT. The lease of membership Properties to TT was terminated upon closing. As a result of the lease termination, beginning August 14, 2008, Income from other investments, net no longer included rental income from the lease of membership
Properties. (See Note 2(n) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.) 


(3) 
 During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company acquired a portfolio of 74 manufactured home communities and one RV resort (the
Acquisition Properties) containing 30,129 sites on approximately 6,400 acres located in 16 states and certain manufactured homes and loans secured by manufactured homes located at the Acquisition Properties which the Company refers
to as the Home Related Assets. (See Note 
  31 


Table of Contents


 
 
19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for further discussion on the Acquisition.) The in-place leases acquired in the Acquisition have an estimated
useful life of one-year. Transaction costs consist primarily of the following costs incurred related to the Acquistion: sellers debt defeasance costs, transfer tax, professional fees, and costs related to due diligence items such as title,
survey, zoning and environmental. 


(4) 
 Represents a non-cash charge related to the write-off of goodwill of approximately $3.6 million. The goodwill was recorded in connection with
the Companys August 2009 acquisition of a small Florida internet and media based advertising business. 


(5) 
 On March 4, 2011, the Company, on behalf of selling stockholders, closed on a public offering of 8.0 million shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, at a price of $24.75 per share. The selling stockholders received the Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for $200 million of previously issued series D and series F
Perpetual Preferred OP Units. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have preference rights with respect to liquidation and distributions over the common stock. The Company has the option at any time to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the offering. 


(6) 
 The Company believes that the book value of the Properties, which reflects the historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated
depreciation, is less than the current market value of the Properties. 


(7) 
 On June 7, 2011, the Company issued 6,037,500 shares of common stock in an equity offering for proceeds of approximately $344.0 million, net of
offering costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued 1,708,276 shares of Common Stock and 1,740,000 shares of Series B Subordinated Non-Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock) with an
aggregate value of $224.2 million, net of offering costs, to partially fund the Acquisition, which is discussed in more detail in Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K. All of the Series B
Preferred Stock was redeemed for Common Stock prior to December 31, 2011. On June 29, 2009, the Company issued 4.6 million shares of common stock in an equity offering for proceeds of approximately $146.4 million, net of offering

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  2011 Accomplishments 
 


 

 
 Closed on the acquisition of 74 manufactured home communities and one RV resort for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion including assumed
debt. The newly acquired properties were located in 16 states and contain 30,129 sites. (See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for further discussion on the Acquisition.)


 
 Raised the annual dividend to $1.50 per share in 2011, up from $1.20 per share in 2010. 
Overview and Outlook  Occupancy in the Companys Properties as well as its ability to increase rental rates directly affects revenues. The Companys revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting
its sites on a long-term basis.  The Company has approximately 95,100 annual sites, approximately 9,000
seasonal sites, which are leased to customers generally for three to six months, and approximately 9,700 transient sites, occupied by customers who lease sites on a short-term basis. The revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher
during the first and third quarters. The Company expects to service over 100,000 customers at its transient sites and the Company considers this revenue stream to be its most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions, gas prices, and other
factors affecting the marginal RV customers vacation and travel preferences. Finally, the Company has approximately 24,300 sites designated as right-to-use sites, which are primarily utilized to service the approximately 105,000 customers who
have right-to-use contracts. The Company also has interests in Properties containing approximately 3,100 sites for which revenue is classified as Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Table of Contents
A significant portion of the Companys rental agreements on community
sites are directly or indirectly tied to published CPI statistics that are issued during June through September each year. The Company currently expects its 2012 Core community base rental income to increase approximately 2.3% as compared to 2011.
The Company has already notified 75% of its community site customers of rent increases reflecting this revenue growth.  The Company believes that the disruption in the site-built housing market is contributing to the low new home sales volumes it is experiencing as potential customers are not able to sell their existing
site-built homes. Customers have also become more price sensitive, which is reflected in an increase in used home sale volumes.  In this environment, the Company believes that customer demand for rentals, which do not require a down payment, is high. The Company is adapting to this by renting its vacant new homes. This may
represent an attractive source of occupancy if the Company can convert renters to new homebuyers in the future. The Company is also focusing on smaller, more energy efficient and more affordable homes in its manufactured home Properties. 
The Companys manufactured home rental operations have been increasing since 2007. For the year ended
December 31, 2011, occupied manufactured home rentals increased to 4,423, or 387.7%, from 907 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net operating income increased to approximately $23.1 million in 2011 from approximately $5.9 million
in 2007. The Company believes that unlike the home sales business, at this time the Company competes effectively with other types of rentals (i.e. apartments). The Company is currently evaluating whether it wants to continue to invest in additional
rental units.  In the Companys resort Properties, the Company continues to work on extending customer
stays. The Company has had success lengthening customer stays.  The Company has introduced low-cost membership
products that focus on the installed base of almost eight million RV owners. Such products may include right-to-use contracts that entitle the customer to use certain properties (the Agreements). The Company is offering a Zone Park Pass
(ZPP), which can be purchased for one to four zones of the United States and requires annual payments of $499. This replaces high cost products that were sold at Properties after tours and lengthy sales presentations. The Company
historically incurred significant costs to generate leads, conduct tours and make the sales presentations.  A
single zone pass requires no upfront payment while passes for additional zones require modest upfront payments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold approximately 7,500 ZPPs. 
Existing customers may be offered an upgrade Agreement from time-to-time. The upgrade Agreement is currently
distinguishable from a new Agreement that a customer would enter into by (1) increased length of consecutive stay by 50% (i.e. up to 21 days); (2) ability to make earlier advance reservations; (3) discounts on rental units and
(4) access to additional Properties, which may include discounts at non-membership RV Properties. Each upgrade requires a nonrefundable upfront payment. The Company may finance the nonrefundable upfront payment under any Agreement.

2011 Acquisition Disclosure 
On May 31, 2011, the Companys operating partnership entered into purchase and other agreements (the
Purchase Agreements) to acquire a portfolio of 75 manufactured home communities and one RV resort (the Acquisition Properties) containing 31,167 sites on approximately 6,500 acres located in 16 states (primarily located
in Florida and the northeastern region of the United States) and certain manufactured homes and loans secured by manufactured homes located at the Acquisition Properties which the Company refers to as the Home Related Assets and
collectively with the Acquisition Properties, as the Acquisition Portfolio, for a stated purchase price of $1.43 billion (the Acquisition). The Company completed the acquisition of 75 Acquisition Properties, containing
30,129 sites, during the six months ended December 31, 2011. Total transaction costs associated with the Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $18.5 million. 
The purchase price of the Acquisition was funded primarily through: 
 


 

 
 the net proceeds of approximately $344.0 million from the Companys June 2011 public offering of 6,037,500 shares of common stock;
  


 

 
 the assumption by the Company of fixed-rate, non-recourse mortgage indebtedness secured by 35 of the Acquisition Properties of approximately $515.0
million, with stated interest rates ranging from 4.65% to 8.87% per annum and maturity dates ranging from 2012 to 2023;   


 

 
 the Companys issuance to the seller of: (i) 1,708,276 shares of the Companys common stock, and (ii) 1,740,000 shares
of Series B Preferred Stock which in the Purchase Agreements have a stipulated aggregate value of $200.0 million;   


 

 
 $200.0 million of mortgage notes payable through two 10-year secured financings the Company entered into during the three months ended
September 30, 2011 with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.02% per annum (see Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for a description of the mortgage notes payable.); and
  


 

 
 a $200.0 million senior unsecured term loan (the Term Loan) entered into on July 1, 2011 that matures on June 30, 2017
and has a one-year extension option, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.85% to 2.80% per annum and, subject to certain conditions, may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty after July 1, 2014 (see Note 8 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-k for a description of the Term Loan.)  The terms of the Purchase Agreement provided for a July 1, 2011 closing for one remaining Acquisition Property in Michigan, and as a result of underwriting issues related to the property the Company
and seller agreed that the Companys acquisition of the Michigan property would be deemed terminated. The Company is continuing to perform due diligence on the Michigan property, but there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire the
property. (See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)  Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates  The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting
policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 
Long-Lived Assets  For business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, the purchase price of Properties is determined in accordance the Codification Topic Business
Combinations (FASB ASC 805) 
  36 


Table of Contents

which requires the Company to recognize all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. The Company also
expenses transaction costs as they are incurred. Certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following any acquisition and applied retroactively to the date of acquisition. 
In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources,
including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective Property and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each Property as a result of its due
diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company generally uses a 30-year
estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements (including site development), a ten-year estimated life for building upgrades and a five-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment and a one year life applied
for acquired in-place leases. New rental units are generally depreciated using a 20-year estimated life from each model year down to a salvage value of 40% of the original costs. Used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimated
life of the unit with no estimated salvage value.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are
expensed to operations as incurred, and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life. 
The values of above-and below-market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below-market
leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease. The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of
lease renewal.  The Company accounts for its Properties held for disposition in accordance with the
Codification Sub-Topic Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FASB ASC 360-10-35). The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets to be held and used, including its investments in real estate, for impairment
indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude
that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.  For long-lived assets to be held and
used, if an impairment indicator exists, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset,
the Company would record an impairment loss if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset.  For Properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the Property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the Property measured at the
time the Company has made a decision to dispose of the property, has a commitment to sell the Property and/or is actively marketing the Property for sale. A Property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated
fair value, less costs to sell. Subsequent to the date that a Property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35. Accordingly, the results of operations for all assets sold or held for sale
have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.  Revenue Recognition 
The Company accounts for leases with its customers as operating leases. Rental income is recognized over the term of the
respective lease or the length of a customers stay, the majority of which are for a term of not

greater than one year. The Company will reserve for receivables when it believes the ultimate collection is less than probable. The Companys provision for uncollectible rents receivable was
approximately $4.4 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  The Company accounts for the upfront payment related to the entry or upgrade of right-to-use contracts in accordance with the Codification Topic Revenue Recognition (FASB ASC 605).
A right-to-use contract gives the customer the right to a set schedule of usage at a specified group of Properties. Customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of Properties they may access. A contract
requires the customer to make annual payments during the term of the contract and may require an upfront nonrefundable payment. The stated term of a right-to-use contract is at least one year and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to
make the annual payments. The Company will recognize the upfront non-refundable payments over the estimated customer life which, based on historical attrition rates, the Company has estimated to be from one to 31 years. For example, the Company
has currently estimated that 7.9% of customers who enter a new right-to-use contract will terminate their contract after five years. Therefore, the upfront nonrefundable payments from 7.9% of the contracts entered in any particular period are
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years as five years is the estimated customer life for 7.9% of the Companys customers who enter a contract. The historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new
contracts, and therefore, the nonrefundable upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts. The decision to recognize this revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605 was made after corresponding during
September and October of 2008 with the Office of the Chief Accountant at the SEC.  Right-to-use annual
payments by customers under the terms of the right-to-use contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the one-year period in which the services are provided. 
Income from home sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete. The earnings process is complete when the
home has been delivered, the purchaser has accepted the home and title has transferred.  Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the Codification Topic Stock Compensation
(FASB ASC 718). The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, consultants and directors.  Non-controlling Interests  In December 2007, the FASB
issued the Codification Topic Consolidation, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FASB ASC 810). FASB ASC 810 seeks to improve uniformity and transparency in reporting of the net income attributable to
non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity. The statement requires, among other provisions, the disclosure, clear labeling and presentation of non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. Per FASB ASC 810, a non-controlling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The ownership interests in the subsidiary
that are held by owners other than the parent are non-controlling interests. Under FASB ASC 810, such non-controlling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity, separately from the Companys equity. However,
securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder, not solely within the control of the issuer, must be classified outside of permanent equity. This would result in certain outside ownership interests being included
as redeemable non-controlling interests outside of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company makes this determination based on terms in applicable agreements, specifically in relation to redemption provisions. Additionally,
with respect to non-controlling interests for which the Company has a choice to settle the contract by delivery of its own shares, the Company considered the guidance in the Codification Topic Derivatives and HedgingContracts in
Entitys Own Equity (FASB ASC 815-40) to evaluate whether it controls the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under share settlement of the contract.

Table of Contents
In accordance with FASB ASC 810, the Company presents the non-controlling
interest for Common OP Units in the Equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The caption Common OP Units on the consolidated balance sheets also includes $0.5 million of private REIT Subsidiaries preferred stock. The Companys
Perpetual Preferred OP Units are presented in the mezzanine section on the consolidated balance sheets.  Notes Receivable 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company purchased Chattel Loans that were recorded at fair value at the
time of acquisition under the Codification Topic Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (FASB ASC 310-30). (See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form
10-K for a detailed description of our recent Acquisition.) The fair value of these Chattel Loans includes an estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the receivables, and therefore no allowance for
losses was recorded for these Chattel Loans as of the transaction date. The fair value is estimated based on a number of factors including customer delinquency status, FICO scores, the original down payment amount and below-market stated interest
rates. Through December 31, 2011, the credit performance of these Chattel Loans has generally been consistent with the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value, and the Companys original expectations regarding the amounts
and timing of future cash flows has not changed. A probable decrease in managements expectation of future cash collections related to these Chattel Loans could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses in the future. Due to
the size of the Chattel Loan pool and maturity dates ranging up to 29 years, future credit losses or changes to interest income could be significant. (See Notes 2(h) and 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form
10-K.)  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that it believes have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010-06), which expands required disclosures related to an entitys fair value measurements. Certain provisions of ASU 2010-06 were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2009, and the Company adopted those provisions as of January 1, 2010. The remaining provisions, which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010, require additional
disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in an entitys reconciliation of recurring level three investments. The Company adopted the final provisions of ASU 2010-06 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU
2010-06 did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.  In December 2010, FASB issued
ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. This ASU specifies that when financial statements are presented, the revenue and earnings of the
combined entity should be disclosed as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. ASU No. 2010-29 is effective for business
combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2011. The adoption of this update increased the required disclosures for the Companys Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements by requiring the Company to disclose pro forma
information. (See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)  In
December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying

  39 


Table of Contents

Amounts. This ASU requires that reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill
impairment exists. ASU No. 2010-28 is effective for the Company beginning with this interim period. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. This ASU is intended to eliminate differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for fair value measurement and reporting. ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for the Company
beginning the first quarter of 2012. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive
Income. ASU No. 2011-05 amends current guidance found in FASB ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011-05 requires entities to present comprehensive income in either: (i) one continuous financial statement or
(ii) two separate but consecutive statements that display net income and the components of other comprehensive income. Totals and individual components of both net income and other comprehensive income must be included in either presentation.
ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2012. The Company plans to apply the provisions of this guidance once adopted. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASU
2011-08). ASU 2011-08 amends current guidance to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment an entity would not
be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 applies to all companies
that have goodwill reported in their financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2011-08 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements as the Company has chosen not to adopt this guidance early.

 Property Operating Revenues 
The 1.3% increase in the Core Portfolio property operating revenues primarily reflects (i) a 2.2% increase in rates
in community base rental income and a 0.6% increase in occupancy (ii) a 0.6% increase in revenues in core resort base income, as described in the table below and (iii) a decrease of 8.4% in right-to-use contracts. The reduction in entry of
right-to-use contracts is due to the Companys introduction of low-cost membership products in 2010 and the phase-out of memberships with higher initial upfront payments.  Resort base rental income is comprised of the following (amounts in thousands):

Property Operating Expenses 
The 0.3% decrease in property operating expenses in the Core Portfolio reflects (i) a 0.4% increase in property
operating and maintenance expenses and (ii) and a 11.0% decrease in sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses are all related to the costs incurred for the entry or upgrade of right-to-use contracts. The decrease in sales and
marketing expenses is due to reduced commissions as a result of reduced high-cost right-to-use contracts activity.  The increase in Total Portfolio income from property operations is primarily due to the acquisition of 75 Acquisition Properties during the year ended December 31, 2011. (See Note 19 in the notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for details regarding these closings.)  Home Sales Operations

(1) 
 Approximately $23.9 million and $15.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are included in Community base rental income
in the Property Operations table.  The increase in income from rental operations and
depreciation expense is primarily due to the increase in the number of rental units resulting from the acquisition of 75 Acquisition Properties during the year ended December 31, 2011. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company acquires used homes from customers through purchase, lien, sale or
abandonment. In a vibrant new home sale market older homes may be removed from sites and replaced with new homes. In other cases, due to the nature of tenancy rights afforded to purchasers, used homes are rented in order to control the site either
in the condition received or after warranted rehabilitation.  Other Income and Expenses

Table of Contents
Depreciation on real estate and other costs, amortization of in-place
leases, interest income and interest expense increased primarily due to the purchase of 75 Acquisition Properties during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transaction costs consist primarily of the following costs incurred related to the
Acquisition: sellers debt defeasance costs, transfer tax, professional fees, and costs related to due diligence items such as title, survey, zoning and environmental. Impairment decreased due to a non-cash write-off of $3.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2010 of goodwill associated with a 2009 acquisition of a Florida internet and media based advertising business. 
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2010 to Year Ended December 31, 2009 
The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Property Operations for all Properties owned
and operated for the same period in both years (Core Portfolio) and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands). The Core Portfolio may change from time-to-time depending on
acquisitions, dispositions and significant transactions or unique situations. The Core Portfolio in this comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2009 includes all Properties acquired on or prior to December 31,
2008 and which were owned and operated by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Growth percentages exclude the impact of GAAP deferrals of up-front payments from right-to-use contracts entered and
related commissions.

 Property Operating Revenues 
The 1.5% increase in the Core Portfolio property operating revenues primarily reflects (i) a 2.4% increase in rates
in community base rental income (ii) a 3.3% increase in revenues in core resort base income, as described in the table below and (iii) a decrease of 9.4% in right-to-use contracts. The reduction in entry of right-to-use contracts is due to
the Companys recent introduction of low-cost membership products in the spring of 2010 and the phase-out of memberships with higher initial upfront payments.

 Property Operating Expenses 
The 1.5% increase in property operating expenses in the Core Portfolio reflects (i) a 2.2% increase in property
operating and maintenance expenses (ii) a 1.1% increase in property taxes and (iii) a 6.9% decrease in sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses are all related to the costs incurred for the entry or upgrade of
right-to-use contracts. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses is due to reduced commissions as a result of reduced high-cost right-to-use contracts activity. Total Portfolio property management expenses primarily decreased due to decreased
payroll expenses for 2010.  Home Sales Operations

 Interest income is lower primarily due to lower notes receivable amounts outstanding.
Income from other investments, net, decreased primarily due to reduced insurance proceeds of $1.3 million and the 2009 gain on sale of Caledonia of $0.8 million. Rent control initiatives are higher due to increased activity in the San Rafael legal
appeal (see Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K). Impairment is a non-cash write-off of $3.6 million in goodwill associated with a 2009 acquisition of a Florida internet and media based advertising
business. Interest expense is lower primarily due to lower mortgage notes payable amounts outstanding.

Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $0.9 million
primarily due to a $1.1 million gain in 2009 on the sale of the Companys 25% interest in two Diversified Portfolio joint ventures, offset by $0.4 million of distributions that exceeded the Companys basis in its joint venture and were
recorded in income in 2010.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity  As of December 31, 2011 the Company
had $70.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $380.0 million available on its line of credit. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash
provided by operating activities and availability under its existing line of credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by use of its
current cash balance, long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash
provided by operating activities. The Company has approximately $34.6 million of scheduled debt maturities in 2012 (excluding scheduled principal payments on debt maturing in 2012 and beyond). The Company expects to satisfy its 2012 maturities with
its existing cash balance.  The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (amounts in thousands).

 Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities increased $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in 2011 was
primarily due an increase in net income net of depreciation expense and amortization of in-place leases. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $150.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in consolidated income from continuing operations and an increase in rents received in advance.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities
reflects the impact of the following investing activities:  Acquisitions 
2011 Acquisitions  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company closed on 75 of the Acquisition Properties and certain Home Related Assets associated with such 75 Acquisition Properties for a purchase price of

  47 


Table of Contents

approximately $1.5 billion. The Company funded the purchase price of this closing with (i) the issuance of 1,708,276 shares of its common stock, to the seller with an aggregate value of
approximately $111 million, (ii) the issuance of 1,740,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the seller with an aggregate value of approximately $113 million, (iii) the assumption of mortgage debt secured by 35
Acquisition Properties with an aggregate value of approximately $548 million, (iv) the net proceeds of approximately $344 million, net of offering costs, from a common stock offering of 6,037,500 shares, (v) approximately $200
million of cash from the Term Loan the Company closed on July 1, 2011, and (vi) approximately $200 million of cash from new secured financings originated during the third quarter of 2011. The assumed mortgage debt has stated interest rates
ranging from 4.65% to 8.87% per annum and matures from dates ranging from 2012 to 2023. (See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for a description of the Companys recent acquisitions.)
 2009 Acquisitions  On February 13, 2009, the Company acquired the remaining 75% interests in three Diversified Portfolio joint ventures known as (i) Robin Hill, a 270-site property in Lenhartsville, Pennsylvania,
(ii) Sun Valley, a 265-site property in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, and (iii) Plymouth Rock, a 609-site property in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. The gross purchase price was approximately $19.2 million, and the Company assumed mortgage loans of
approximately $12.9 million with a value of approximately $11.9 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6% per annum.  On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired an internet and media based advertising business located in Orlando, Florida for approximately $3.7 million. 
Dispositions  On February 13, 2009, the Company sold its 25% interest in two Diversified Portfolio joint ventures known as (i) Pine Haven, a 625-site property in Ocean View, New Jersey and (ii) Round
Top, a 319-site property in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A gain on sale of approximately $1.1 million was recognized during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and is included in Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
On April 17, 2009, the Company sold Caledonia, a 247-site Property in Caledonia, Wisconsin, for proceeds of
approximately $2.2 million. The Company recognized a gain on sale of approximately $0.8 million which is included in Income from other investments, net. In addition, the Company received approximately $0.3 million of deferred rent due from the
previous tenant.  On July 20, 2009, the Company sold Casa Village, a 490-site Property in Billings,
Montana for a stated purchase price of approximately $12.4 million. The buyer assumed $10.6 million of mortgage debt that had a stated interest rate of 6.02% and was schedule to mature in 2013. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of
approximately $5.1 million. Cash proceeds from the sale, net of closing costs were approximately $1.1 million. 
The operating results of all properties sold or held for disposition have been reflected in the discontinued operations
of the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in this Form 10-K, except for Caledonia.  Notes Receivable Activity
 The notes receivable activity during the year ended December 31, 2011 of $0.9 million in cash
outflow reflects net repayments of $2.3 million from the Companys Chattel Loans, net repayments of $0.7 million from its Contract Receivables and lending of $3.8 million to Lakeland RV. (See Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)  The notes receivable activity during the year ended
December 31, 2010 of $1.2 million in cash inflow reflects net repayments of $0.4 million from the Companys Chattel Loans, net repayments of $0.7 million from its Contract Receivables and a net inflow of $0.1 million on other notes
receivable.

7.36%.  Secured Property Debt  As of December 31, 2011 the Companys secured long-term debt balance was approximately $2.1 billion, with a weighted average interest rate in 2011 of approximately 5.8% per annum. The debt
bears interest at rates between 4.7% and 8.9% per annum and matures on various dates primarily ranging from 2012 to 2023. The weighted average term to maturity for the long-term debt is approximately 5.3 years. The Company expects to satisfy
its secured debt maturities of approximately $34.6 million occurring prior to December 31, 2012 with its existing cash balance. 
Unsecured Debt  On May 19, 2011, the Company amended its unsecured Line of Credit (LOC) to increase its borrowing capacity under the LOC from $100 million to a maximum borrowing capacity of $380 million
and to extend the maturity date to September 18, 2015. The LOC accrues interest at an annual rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 1.65% to 2.50% and contains a 0.30% to 0.40% facility fee as well as certain other customary negative and
affirmative covenants. The Company has an eight-month extension option under the LOC, subject to payment by it of certain administrative fees and the satisfaction of certain other enumerated conditions. The spread over LIBOR and the facility fee
pricing are variable based on leverage measured quarterly throughout the term of the LOC. The Company incurred commitment and arrangement fees of approximately $3.6 million to enter into the amended LOC.
The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 for the Companys unsecured
debt was approximately 3.9% and 0.0% per annum, respectively. No amounts were outstanding on the line of credit at any time during the year ended December 31, 2010.

 Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $31.4 million, primarily due to the fair market value adjustment of the assumption of $515.0 million
of secured debt from the Acquisition Properties. Balances include debt maturing and scheduled periodic principal payments 


(2) 
 Amounts include interest expected to be incurred on the Companys secured debt based on obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2011.
 The Company does not include insurance, property taxes and cancelable contracts in the
contractual obligations table above.  The Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain
of the Properties expiring in various years from 2013 to 2054, with terms which require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2011, ground lease rent
was approximately $2.5 million and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, ground lease rent was approximately $1.9 million. Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately

  51 


Table of Contents

$3.3 million for 2012 and 2013, approximately $1.9 million in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016, and approximately $14.9 million thereafter. The decrease in future minimum rental payments assumes
that the Company will exercise its option to acquire land at the recently acquired Colony Cove Property on January 1, 2014. The option exercise date is subject to certain assumptions and the timing of the option exercise may be before or after
January 1, 2014.  With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the maturities of its
long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately five years, with approximately $589 million (which is due in 2015) in principal maturities coming due in any single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing
debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from operating cash flow, asset sales and/or the
proceeds from equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the Companys future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization
payments.  Equity Transactions  In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to its stockholders. The following regular quarterly
distributions have been declared and paid to common stockholders and non-controlling interests since January 1, 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued 1,708,276
shares of common stock and 1,740,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. All of the shares were issued to partially fund the Acquisition discussed in detail in Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form
10-K.  On October 24, 2011, the Company, on behalf of a selling stockholder, closed on a public offering
of 3,162,069 shares of common stock. The 3,162,069 shares of common stock sold included 1,453,793 shares of common stock issued by the Company upon redemption of 1,453,793 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Company did not receive any proceeds
from the offering.  On June 7, 2011, the Company issued 6,037,500 shares of common stock in an equity
offering for approximately $344.0 million in proceeds, net of offering costs. The proceeds were used to partially fund the Acquisition discussed in detail in Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.
 During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company received approximately $5.4 million in proceeds
from the issuance of shares of common stock through stock option exercises and the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).  2010 Activity  On December 31,
2010, September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million Series D 8% Units and 7.95% per annum on the $50 million

2009, September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership paid distributions of 8.0625% per annum on the $150 million Series D 8% Units and 7.95% per annum on the $50 million
of Series F 7.95% Units.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received approximately
$5.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock, through stock option exercises and the Companys ESPP. 
Inflation  Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each
lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company. In addition, the Companys resort Properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis. The
Companys right-to-use contracts generally provide for an annual dues increase, but dues may be frozen under the terms of certain contracts if the customer is over 61 years old.  Funds From Operations  Funds from Operations
(FFO) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), is

  53 


Table of Contents

generally an appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from
operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. 
The Company defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or actual or estimated losses
from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO
on the same basis. The Company receives up-front non-refundable payments from the entry of right-to-use contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the upfront non-refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated
customer life. Although the NAREIT definition of FFO does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right-to-use payments, the Company believes that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in its calculation of FFO. The
Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or actual or estimated losses from
sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. The
Company believes that the adjustment to FFO for the net revenue deferral of upfront non-refundable payments and expense deferral of right-to-use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO,
along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity REITs operating performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with its interpretation of
standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company
does. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with
GAAP, as an indication of the Companys financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of its liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs,
including its ability to make cash distributions.  The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands):

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The Companys earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on
prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk the Company faces is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in market
interest rates. At December 31, 2011, approximately 100% or approximately $2.1 billion of the Companys outstanding secured debt had fixed interest rates, which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in
interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $107.4 million. For each decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total outstanding
debt would increase by approximately $113.3 million.  At December 31, 2011 none of the Companys
outstanding secured debt was short-term. The Companys $200.0 million Term Loan, closed on July 1, 2011, has variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.85% to 2.80% per annum.

information the Company is required to disclose in the reports that the Company files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to
disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Companys periodic reports.  The
Companys management with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2011. Based on that
evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable
assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to the Company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder as of December 31, 2011.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
As previously announced and discussed in this Form 10-K, the Company acquired 75 Acquisition Properties during the year
ended December 31, 2011. The Company is in the process of integrating the operations of these Acquisition Properties with those of the Company and incorporating the internal controls and procedures of these Acquisition Properties into its
internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect this acquisition to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting. The Company will report on its assessment of the combined operations within the one-year time
period provided by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable SEC rules and regulations concerning business combinations. As a result, management excluded certain internal controls, primarily related to the Acquisition Properties, from its
assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. The Acquisition Properties operations included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of the Company constituted approximately
$1,453.2 million and $835.8 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and approximately $60.0 million of revenues for the year then ended. 
Excluding the operations of the 75 Acquisition Properties, there were no material changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011.  Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Managements assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the 75 Acquisition Properties, which are included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted $1,453.2 million and
$835.8 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and $60.0 million of revenues for the year then ended. Management maintains, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been
audited by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on Page F-2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

stock on the first or last trading day of the purchase period. Purchases of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are made on the first business day of the next month after the close of the purchase period. Under New York Stock
Exchange rules then in effect, stockholder approval was not required for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan because it is a broad-based plan available generally to all employees.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc. 
We have audited Equity Lifestyle Properties, Incs (Equity Lifestyle Properties or the Company) internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Equity Lifestyle Properties
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Item 9A. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Acquisition Properties (as defined in Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in this Form 10-K) , which are included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted $1,453.2 million and $835.8 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and $60.0 million of
revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquisition Properties. 
In our opinion, Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc., maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2011, and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15, of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc., and our report dated February 28, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc. (Equity Lifestyle Properties or the
Company), as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
schedules based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Lifestyle Properties at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Equity Lifestyle Properties internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 1Organization of the Company and Basis of Presentation  Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership) and other consolidated subsidiaries (the
Subsidiaries), is referred to herein as the Company and ELS. The Company is a fully integrated owner and operator of lifestyle-oriented properties (Properties). The Company leases individual developed
areas (sites) with access to utilities for placement of factory built homes, cottages, cabins or recreational vehicles (RVs). Properties are designed and improved for several home options of various sizes and designs that are
produced off-site, installed and set on designated sites (Site Set) within the Properties. At certain Properties, the Company provides access to its sites through right-to-use or membership contracts. The Company believes that it has
qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its taxable year ended December 31, 1993. The Company plans to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many
of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The Company cannot, therefore, guarantee that it has qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that the Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various
factual matters that may not be totally within its control and it cannot provide any assurance that the IRS will agree with its analysis. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of the Companys gross income must come from sources that
are itemized in the REIT tax laws. The Company is also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income computed without regard to its deduction for dividends paid and its net capital gain. As of December 31, 2011,
the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $88 million that can be utilized to offset future distribution requirements. The fact that the Company holds its assets through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries further
complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the Companys REIT qualification. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the
courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for the Company to remain qualified as a REIT. The Company does not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its REIT qualification.
 If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular
corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted the Company relief under certain statutory provisions, it would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a
REIT, the Company is subject to certain foreign, state and local taxes on its income and property and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. 
The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating Partnership. The Company contributed the
proceeds from its initial public offering and subsequent offerings to the Operating Partnership for a general partnership interest. In 2004, the general partnership interest was contributed to MHC Trust, a private REIT subsidiary owned by the
Company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may cause the Company to
earn income which is not qualifying for the REIT gross income tests, the Company has formed taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. 
Several Properties are wholly owned by taxable REIT subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc.
(RSI) is a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company that is engaged in the business of purchasing and selling or leasing Site Set homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by the Company. RSI also provides
brokerage services to residents at such Properties for those residents who move from a Property but do not relocate their homes. RSI may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local brokers, by seeking buyers for the Site Set homes.
Subsidiaries of RSI also operate ancillary activities at certain Properties consisting of operations such as golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 1Organization of the Company and Basis of Presentation (continued) 
 
The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the Common OP
Unitholders) receive an allocation of net income that is based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership that is shown on the Consolidated Financial Statements as Non-controlling interestsCommon OP Units. As
of December 31, 2011, the Non-Controlling InterestsCommon OP Units represented 4,103,067 units of limited partnership interest (OP Units) which are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Companys common
stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or Common OP Units changes the respective ownership of the Operating Partnership for the Non-controlling interestsCommon OP Units. 
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   


(a)
 Basis of Consolidation  The Company consolidates its majority-owned subsidiaries in which it has the ability to control the operations of the subsidiaries and all variable interest entities with respect to which the Company is
the primary beneficiary. The Company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, the purchase price of Properties is accounted for in accordance with the Codification Topic Business Combinations (FASB ASC 805). 
The Company has applied the Codification Sub-Topic Variable Interest Entities (FASB ASC
810-10-15). The objective of FASB ASC 810-10-15 is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a VIE
need to be included in a companys consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2010, a company that held a variable interest in an entity was required to consolidate such entity if the company absorbed a majority of the
entitys expected losses or received a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company also applied the Codification Sub-Topic Control of Partnerships and Similar
Entities (FASB ASC 810-20), which determines whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity and therefore should consolidate the entity. Beginning January 1, 2010,
the Codification Sub-Topic ASC 810-10-15 adopted amendments to the variable interest consolidation model described above. The requirement to consolidate a VIE as revised in this amendment is based on the qualitative analysis considerations for
primary beneficiary determination which requires a company consolidate an entity determined to be a VIE if it has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the principal activities of the entity and (2) the obligation
to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the residual returns that could be significant the entity. The Company applies apply FASB ASC 810-10-15 and FASB ASC 810-20 to all types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and
corporate interests).  The Company applies the equity method of accounting to entities in which the Company
does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest or for variable interest entities where it is not considered the primary beneficiary, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The
cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Companys investment is passive.   


(b)
 Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets 
  F - 11

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. All property, site counts and acreage amounts are unaudited.   


(c)
 Markets  The Company has two reportable segments which are the Property Operations and Home Sales and Rental Operations segments. The Property Operations segment owns and operates land lease Properties and the
Home Sales and Rental Operations segment purchases, sells and leases homes at the Properties. The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects the Companys belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also consider acquisitions of Properties outside such markets. 
 


(d)
 Real Estate  In accordance with FASB ASC 805, the Company recognizes all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value. The Company also expenses transaction
costs as they are incurred. Certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following any acquisition and applied retroactively to the date of acquisition. 
In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources,
including independent appraisals or valuations that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective Property and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each Property as a result of
its due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company generally uses a 30-year
estimated life for buildings and structural and land improvements acquired (including site development), a ten-year estimated life for building upgrades, a five-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment and a one-year life for
acquired in-place leases. New rental units are generally depreciated using a 20-year estimated life from each model year down to a salvage value of 40% of the original costs. Used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimated life of
the unit with no estimated salvage value.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to
operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life. 
The values of above-and below-market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below-market
leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease. The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of
lease renewal.  In accordance with the Codification Sub-Topic Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived
Assets (FASB ASC 360-10-35), the Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets to be held and used, including its investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is
warranted. 
  F - 12



Table of Contents
Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
For long-lived assets to be held and used, if an impairment indicator
exists, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company would record an
impairment loss for the carrying amount in excess of the estimated fair value, if any, of the asset.  For
Properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the Property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the Property measured at the time the Company has made the decision to dispose
of the Property, has a commitment to sell the Property and/or is actively marketing the Property for sale. A Property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Subsequent to
the date that a Property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded. The Company accounts for its Properties held for disposition in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35. Accordingly, the results of operations for all assets sold or
held for sale have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.   


(e)
 Identified Intangibles and Goodwill 
The Company records acquired intangible assets at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. The Company
amortizes identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business
acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.  The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In accordance
with Codification Topic Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FASB ASC 350), goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets and goodwill, a component of Escrow deposits and other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, were approximately $12.1 million and
$15.9 million respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, this amount was comprised of approximately $4.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of identified intangible assets and approximately $7.8 million of goodwill. Accumulated
amortization of identified intangibles assets was approximately $1.2 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense for the identified intangible assets was approximately $1.9 million and $0.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized a non-cash charge for $3.6 million of goodwill related to the August 2009 acquisition of a small Florida
internet and media based advertising business to reduce the carrying value of the business to its approximate fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold the Florida internet and media based advertising business and
disposed of $3.5 million of intangibles and approximately $2.0 million of related accumulated amortization of identified intangible assets.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all demand and money market accounts and certificates of deposit with a maturity date, when purchased, of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 include approximately $4.2 and $3.0 million, respectively, of restricted cash.   


(g)
 Short-term Investments  The Companys short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturity dates in excess of three months which are treated as held-to-maturity and are carried at the amortized cost. All U.S.
Treasury Bills held as of December 31, 2010 matured and were redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2011.   


(h)
 Notes Receivable  Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, unamortized discounts or premiums, and an allowance. Interest
income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Discounts or premiums are amortized to income using the interest method. In certain cases the Company finances the sales of homes to its customers (referred to as Chattel Loans) which
loans are secured by the homes. The valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Chattel Loans is calculated based on delinquency trends and a comparison of the outstanding principal balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. (National
Automobile Dealers Association) value and the current estimated market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company purchased Chattel Loans that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition under the Codification Topic Loans and Debt Securities
Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (FASB ASC 310-30). (See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for a detailed description of our recent Acquisition.) The fair value of these
Chattel Loans includes an estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the receivables, and therefore no allowance for losses was recorded for these Chattel Loans as of the transaction date. The fair
value is estimated based on a number of factors including customer delinquency status, FICO scores, the original down payment amount and below-market stated interest rates. Through December 31, 2011, the credit performance of these Chattel
Loans has generally been consistent with the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value, and the Companys original expectations regarding the amounts and timing of future cash flows has not changed. A probable decrease in
managements expectation of future cash collections related to these Chattel Loans could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses in the future. Due to the size of the Chattel Loan pool and maturity dates ranging up to 29
years, future credit losses or changes to interest income could be significant.

The Company also provides financing for nonrefundable upfront payments
on entering or upgrades of right-to-use contracts (Contracts Receivable). Based upon historical collection rates and current economic trends, when an up-front payment is financed, a reserve is established for a portion of the Contracts
Receivable balance estimated to be uncollectible. The reserve and the rate at which the Company provides for losses on its Contracts Receivable could be increased or decreased in the future based on its actual collection experience. (See Note 7 in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)  On August 14, 2008, the
Company purchased Contracts Receivable that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition under the FASB ASC 310-30. The fair value of these Contracts Receivable included an estimate of losses that were expected to be incurred over the
estimated life of the Contracts Receivable, and therefore no allowance for losses was recorded for these Contracts Receivable as of the transaction date. Through December 31, 2011, the credit performance of these Contracts Receivable has been
better than the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value, and the Company has recently updated its expectations regarding the amounts and timing of future cash flows. A probable decrease in managements expectation of future cash
collections related to these Contracts Receivable could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses in the future. A significant and probable increase in expected cash flows would generally result in an increase in interest income
recognized over the remaining life of the underlying pool of Contracts Receivable.   


(i)
 Investments in Joint Ventures  Investments in joint ventures in which the Company does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and
major decisions, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted for the Companys share of the equity in net income or loss from the date of acquisition and reduced by distributions
received. The income or loss of each entity is allocated in accordance with the provisions of the applicable operating agreements. The allocation provisions in these agreements may differ from the ownership interests held by each investor.
Differences between the carrying amount of the Companys investment in the respective entities and the Companys share of the underlying equity of such unconsolidated entities are amortized over the respective lives of the underlying
assets, as applicable. (See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.)   


(j)
 Insurance Claims  The Properties are covered against losses caused by various events including fire, flood, property damage, earthquake, windstorm and business interruption by insurance policies containing various
deductible requirements and coverage limits. Recoverable costs are classified in other assets as incurred. Insurance proceeds are applied against the asset when received. Recoverable costs relating to capital items are treated in accordance with the
Companys capitalization policy. The book value of the original capital item is written off once the value of the impaired asset has been determined. Insurance proceeds relating to the capital costs are recorded as income in the period they are
received.  Approximately 70 Florida Properties suffered damage from five hurricanes that struck the state
during 2004 and 2005. The Company estimates its total claim to be approximately $21.0 million and has made claims for full recovery of these amounts, subject to deductibles.

The Company has received proceeds from insurance carriers of
approximately $14.7 million through December 31, 2011. The proceeds were accounted for in accordance with the Codification Topic Contingencies (FASB ASC 450). During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
approximately $2.6 million, $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, has been recognized as a gain on insurance recovery, which is net of approximately $0.9 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of contingent legal fees and
included in income from other investments, net.  On June 22, 2007, the Company filed a lawsuit related to
some of the unpaid claims against certain insurance carriers and its insurance broker. (See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for further discussion of this lawsuit.) 
 


(k)
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
Codification Topic Derivatives and Hedging (FASB ASC 815) provides the disclosure requirements for
derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and
related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Companys
objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.
 As required by FASB ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The
Companys objective in utilizing interest rate derivatives is to add stability to its interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part
of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements
without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the
period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. (See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this
Form 10-K.)   


(l)
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The Companys financial instruments include short-term investments, notes receivable, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, other accrued expenses, interest rate swaps and mortgage notes payable.  Codification Topic
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (FASB ASC 820) establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation
of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined
as follows:  Level 1Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
assets or liabilities in active markets. 
  F - 16



Table of Contents
Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Level 2Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
Level 3Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
 At December 31, 2010, the Companys investments in U.S. Treasury Bills included in short-term
investments of approximately $52.3 million, were classified as held-to-maturity and were measured using unadjusted quoted market prices (Level 1). The Companys mortgage notes payable, a fair value of approximately $2.2 billion, were measured
using quoted price and observable inputs from similar assets and liabilities (Level 2). At December 31, 2011, the Companys cash flow hedges of interest rate risk included in accrued payroll and other operating expenses, were measured
using quoted prices and observable inputs from similar assets and liabilities (Level 2). The Company considers its own credit risk as well as the credit risk of its counterparties when evaluating the fair value of its derivatives. Any adjustments
resulting from credit risk are recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives and amortization in the current period Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of the Companys remaining financial instruments approximate their
carrying or contract values.   


(m)
 Deferred Financing Costs, net  Deferred financing costs, net include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans on a basis that approximates level yield.
Unamortized deferred financing fees are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date. Upon amendment of the line of credit or refinancing of mortgage debt, unamortized deferred financing fees are accounted for in accordance with,
Codification Sub-Topic Modifications and Extinguishments (FASB ASC 470-50-40). Accumulated amortization for such costs was $15.1 million and $12.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 


(n)
 Revenue Recognition  The Company accounts for leases with its customers as operating leases. Rental income is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customers stay, the majority of which are
for a term of not greater than one year. The Company will reserve for receivables when it believes the ultimate collection is less than probable. The Companys provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately $4.4 million and $3.0
million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Companys revenue was generated by approximately 38.5% and 37.6%, respectively, by Properties located in Florida, approximately
10.8% and 11.5%, respectively, by Properties located in Arizona and approximately 17.8% and 19.4%, respectively, by Properties located in California.  The Company accounts for the entry of right-to-use contracts in accordance with the Codification Topic Revenue Recognition (FASB ASC 605). A right-to-use contract gives the
customer the right to a set schedule of usage at a specified group of Properties. Customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of Properties they may access. A contract requires the customer to make annual
payments during the term of the contract and may require an upfront nonrefundable payment. The stated term of a right-to-use contract is at least one-year and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to make the annual payments. The Company
will recognize the upfront non-refundable payments over the estimated customer life which, based on historical attrition rates, the Company has estimated to be from one to 31 years. For example, the Company has currently estimated that 7.9% of
customers who enter a new right-to-use contract will

Table of Contents

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

terminate their contract after five years. Therefore, the upfront nonrefundable payments from 7.9% of the contracts entered in any particular period are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of five years as five years is the estimated customer life for 7.9% of the Companys customers who enter a contract. The historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new contracts, and therefore, the nonrefundable
upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts. The decision to recognize this revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605 was made after corresponding during September and October 2008 with the Office of
the Chief Accountant at the SEC.  Right-to-use annual payments by customers under the terms of the
right-to-use contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the one-year period in which the services are provided.  Income from home sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete. The earnings process is complete when the home has been delivered, the purchaser has accepted the home and title has
transferred.   


(o)
 Non-Controlling Interests  In December 2007, the FASB issued the Codification Topic Consolidation (FASB ASC 810), an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FASB ASC 810 seeks to improve
uniformity and transparency in reporting of the net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity. The statement requires, among other provisions, the disclosure, clear labeling and
presentation of non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. Per FASB ASC 810, a non-controlling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or
indirectly, to a parent. The ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are non-controlling interests. Under FASB ASC 810, such non-controlling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within
equity, separately from the Companys equity. However, securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder, not solely within the control of the issuer, must be classified outside of permanent equity. This would
result in certain outside ownership interests being included as redeemable non-controlling interests outside of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company makes this determination based on terms in applicable agreements,
specifically in relation to redemption provisions. Additionally, with respect to non-controlling interests for which the Company has a choice to settle the contract by delivery of its own shares, the Company considered the guidance in the
Codification Topic Derivatives and HedgingContracts in Entitys Own Equity (FASB ASC 815-40) to evaluate whether it controls the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be
required to be delivered under share settlement of the contract.  Net income is allocated to Common OP
Unitholders based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. Such ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of Common OP Units held by the Common OP Unitholders (4,103,067 and 4,431,420 at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively) by the total OP Units held by the Common OP Unitholders and the Company. Issuance of additional shares of common stock or Common OP Units changes the percentage ownership of both the Non-controlling
interests  Common OP Units and the Company.  Due in part to the exchange rights (which provide for the
conversion of Common OP Units into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis), such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders equity and Non-controlling
Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

In accordance with FASB ASC 810, the Company presents the
non-controlling interest for Common OP Units in the Equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The caption Common OP Units on the consolidated balance sheets also includes $0.5 million of private REIT Subsidiaries preferred stock. The
Companys Perpetual Preferred OP Units are presented in the mezzanine section on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010.   


(p)
 Preferred Stock  On March 4, 2011, the Company, on behalf of selling stockholders, closed on a public offering of 8,000,000 shares of 8.034% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series
A Preferred Stock), par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, at a price of $24.75 per share. The selling stockholders received the Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for $200 million of previously issued series
D and series F Perpetual Preferred OP Units. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the offering. The Company has the option at anytime to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends.  The Company accounts for the Preferred Stock in accordance with the Codification Topic
Distinguishing Liabilities from EquitySEC Materials (FASB ASC 480-10-S99). Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have certain preference rights with respect to the common stock. Based on the Companys analysis,
the Series A Preferred Stock has been classified as redeemable interests outside of permanent equity in the mezzanine section of the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of certain registration requirements or other terms. 
 


(q)
 Income and Other Taxes  Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of operations contain no provision for U.S. federal income taxes for the REIT, but the Company is still subject to certain foreign, state and
local income, excise or franchise taxes. In addition, the Company has several taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) which are subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate tax rates. Overall, the TRSs have federal net
operating loss carryforwards. No net tax benefits have been recorded by the TRSs since it is not considered more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to the TRSs net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. 
The Company adopted the provisions of Codification Topic Income Taxes (FASB 740) on
January 1, 2007. The adoption of FASB 740 resulted in no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state
jurisdictions and Canada. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006. 
As of December 31, 2011, net investment in real estate and notes receivable had a U.S. federal tax basis of
approximately $2.6 billion (unaudited) and $75.7 million (unaudited), respectively.

 Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the Codification Topic Stock Compensation (FASB ASC 718). The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to
estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, consultants and directors. (See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.) 
 


(s)
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010-06), which expands required
disclosures related to an entitys fair value measurements. Certain provisions of ASU 2010-06 were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, and the Company adopted those provisions as of
January 1, 2010. The remaining provisions, which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010, require additional disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in an
entitys reconciliation of recurring level three investments. The Company adopted the final provisions of ASU 2010-06 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
 In December 2010, FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of
Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. This ASU specifies that when financial statements are presented, the revenue and earnings of the combined entity should be disclosed as though the business combination that
occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. ASU No. 2010-29 is effective for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2011. The adoption
of this update increased the required disclosures for the Companys Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements by requiring the Company to disclose pro forma information. (See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in this Form 10-K.)  In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts. This ASU requires that reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts perform Step 2 of the goodwill
impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. ASU No. 2010-28 is effective for the Company beginning with this interim period. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value
Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. This ASU is intended to eliminate differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for fair value measurement and reporting.
ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of 2012. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
 In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of
Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011-05 amends current guidance found in FASB ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011-05 requires entities to present comprehensive income in either: (i) one continuous financial
statement or (ii) two separate but consecutive statements that display net income and the components of other comprehensive income. Totals and individual components of both net income and other comprehensive income must be included in either
presentation. ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2012. The Company plans to apply the provisions of this guidance once adopted. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASU
2011-08). ASU 2011-08 amends current guidance to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment an entity would not
be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 applies to all companies
that have goodwill reported in their financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2011-08 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements as the Company has chosen not to adopt this guidance early.

 Reclassifications  Certain 2009 and 2010 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation. This reclassification had no material effect on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations of the
Company.  Note 3Earnings Per Common Share 
Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year.
Codification Topic Earnings Per Share (FASB ASC 260) defines the calculation of basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Basic and fully diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding
during each year and basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. The conversion of OP Units has been excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of an OP Unit for
a share of common stock has no material effect on earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis.

after July 1, 2014. Prior to July 1, 2014, a prepayment penalty of 2% of the amount prepaid would be owed. The spread over LIBOR is variable based on leverage measured quarterly throughout the loan term. The Term Loan contains an upfront
arrangement fee of approximately $0.5 million, an upfront commitment fee of approximately $1.3 million, an annual administrative agency fee of $20,000, as well as customary representations, warranties and negative and affirmative
covenants, and provides for acceleration of principal and payment of all other amounts payable thereunder upon the occurrence of certain events of default. In connection with the Term Loan, the Company also entered into a three-year LIBOR Swap

$3.6 million to enter into the amended LOC. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys LOC had an
availability of $380 million of which no amounts were outstanding.  The weighted average interest rate for the

Note 9Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk  In June 2011, in connection with the Term Loan, the Company entered into a three-year $200.0 million LIBOR notional swap agreement to trade its variable Term Loan interest rate for a 3.01% fixed rate to
hedge the variable cash flows associated with the Term Loan interest payments. The Swap fixes the underlying LIBOR rate on the Term Loan at 1.11% per annum for the first three years and based on anticipated leverage at the completion of the
Acquisition, the Companys spread over LIBOR is expected to be 2.15% resulting in an initial estimated all-in interest rate of 3.26% per annum. The Company has designated the swap as a cash flow hedge. No gain or loss was recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations related to hedge ineffectiveness or to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing on the Companys cash flow hedge during the year ended December 31, 2011.

2010. The Employment Agreement provided for a minimum annual base salary of $0.3 million, with the option to receive an annual bonus in an amount up to three times his base salary. Mr. McAdams is also subject to a non-compete clause and to
mitigate potential conflicts of interest shall have no authority, on behalf of the Company and its affiliates, to enter into any agreement with any entity controlling, controlled by or affiliated with Privileged Access. Prior to forming Privileged

Note 14Stock Option Plan and Stock Grants 
The Companys Stock Option and Stock Award Plan (the Plan) was adopted in December
1992 and amended and restated from time to time, most recently effective March 23, 2001. Pursuant to the Plan, officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company are offered the opportunity (i) to acquire shares of common stock
through the grant of stock options (Options), including non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code; and (ii) to be awarded shares
of common stock (Restricted Stock Grants), subject to conditions and restrictions determined by the Compensation, Nominating, and Corporate Governance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Compensation
Committee). The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule, if any, of each Option and the term, which term shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. As to the Options that have been granted through December 31,
2011 to officers and employees, generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years following
the date such Options were granted. Stock Options are awarded at the New York Stock Exchange closing price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares of common stock are available for grant under the Plan and
no more than 250,000 shares may be subject to grants to any one individual in any calendar year.  Grants under
the Plan are made by the Compensation Committee, which determines the individuals eligible to receive awards, the types of awards, and the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to any award. In addition, the terms of two specific types of
awards are contemplated under the Plan:   


 

 
 The first type of award is a grant of Options or Restricted Stock Grants of common stock made to each member of the Board at the meeting held
immediately after each annual meeting of the Companys stockholders. Generally, if the director elects to receive Options, the grant will cover 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant. If the director elects to receive a Restricted Stock Grant of common stock, he or she will receive an award of 2,000 shares of common stock. Exercisability or vesting with respect to either type of award will be one-third of the award after
six months, two-thirds of the award after one year, and the full award after two years.   


 

 
 The second type of award is a grant of common stock in lieu of 50% of their bonus otherwise payable to individuals with a title of Vice President or
above. A recipient can request that the Compensation Committee pay a greater or lesser portion of the bonus in shares of common stock.

The Companys Board of Directors is authorized under the Companys charter, without further
stockholder approval, to issue, from time to time, in one or more series, 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock (the Preferred Stock), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board may determine, which
may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Companys common stock. However, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock may require stockholder approval pursuant to the rules and
regulations of The New York Stock Exchange.  On March 4, 2011, the Company, on behalf of selling
stockholders, closed on a public offering of 8,000,000 shares of 8.034% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock), par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, at a
price of $24.75 per share. The selling stockholders received the Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for $200 million of previously issued series D and series F Perpetual Preferred OP Units. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the
offering. The Company has the option at anytime to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued 1,740,000 shares of Series B Subordinated Non-Voting
Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock), par value $0.01 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock was issued to partially fund the Acquisition which is discussed in detail in Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K. On October 24, 2011, the Company, on behalf of a selling stockholder, closed on a public offering of 3,162,069 shares of common stock. The 3,162,069 shares of common stock sold included

286,207 Series B Preferred Stock were redeemed for 286,207 shares of common stock. As of the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. 
Note 16Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan 
On May 11, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan
(the 2010 LTIP) to provide a long-term cash bonus opportunity to certain members of the Companys management. Such Board approval was upon recommendation by the Companys Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee (the Committee).  The total cumulative payment for all participants (the Eligible
Payment) is based upon certain performance conditions being met.  The Committee has responsibility for
administering the 2010 LTIP and may use its reasonable discretion to adjust the performance criteria or Eligible Payments to take into account the impact of any major or unforeseen transaction or events. The 2010 LTIP includes 32 participants. The
Companys executive officers are not participants in the 2010 LTIP. The Eligible Payment will be paid in cash upon completion of the Companys annual audit for the 2012 fiscal year and upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions as
outlined in the 2010 LTIP and, including employer costs, is currently estimated to be approximately $2.9 million. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had accrued compensation expense of approximately $1.8 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, for the 2010 LTIP including approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  On May 15, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (the LTIP) to provide a long-term cash bonus opportunity to certain members of the
Companys management and

executive officers. Such Board approval was upon recommendation of the Committee. The Companys Chief Executive Officer and President were not participants in the LTIP. On January 18,
2010, the Committee approved payments under the LTIP of approximately $2.8 million. The approved payments were fully accrued as of December 31, 2009 and were paid in cash on March 3, 2010. 
The Company is accounting for the LTIPs in accordance with FASB ASC 718. The amount accrued for the 2010 LTIP reflects
the Committees evaluation of the 2010 LTIP based on forecasts and other information presented to the Committee and are subject to performance in line with forecasts and final evaluation and determination by the Committee. There can be no
assurances that the Companys estimates of the probable outcome will be representative of the actual outcome. 
Note 17Savings Plan 
The Company has a qualified retirement plan, with a salary deferral feature designed to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code (the 401(k) Plan), to cover its employees and those of its Subsidiaries, if any. The 401(k) Plan permits eligible employees of the Company and those of any Subsidiary to defer up to 60% of their eligible
compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum amounts. In addition, the Company will match 100% of the participants contribution up to the first 3% and then 50% of the next 2% for a maximum potential match of 4%. 
In addition, amounts contributed by the Company will vest, on a prorated basis, according to the participants
vesting schedule. After five years of employment with the Company, the participants will be 100% vested for all amounts contributed by the Company. Additionally, a discretionary profit sharing component of the 401(k) Plan provides for a contribution
to be made annually for each participant in an amount, if any, as determined by the Company. All employee contributions are 100% vested. The Companys contribution to the 401(k) Plan was approximately $1.1 million, $1.0 million, and $0.8
million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
Note 18Commitments and Contingencies 
California Rent Control Litigation  City of San Rafael  The Company sued the City of San Rafael
in federal court, challenging its rent control ordinance (the Ordinance) on constitutional grounds. The Company believes the litigation was settled by the Citys agreement to amend the ordinance to permit adjustments to market rent
upon turnover. The City subsequently rejected the settlement agreement. The Court refused to enforce the settlement agreement, and submitted to a jury the claim that it had been breached. In October 2002, a jury found no breach of the settlement
agreement.  The Companys constitutional claims against the City were tried in a bench trial during April
2007. On April 17, 2009, the Court issued its Order for Entry of Judgment in the Companys favor (the April 2009 Order). On June 10, 2009, the Court ordered the City to pay the Company net fees and costs of approximately
$2.1 million. On June 30, 2009, as anticipated by the April 2009 Order, the Court entered final judgment that gradually phased out the Citys site rent regulation scheme that the Court found unconstitutional. Pursuant to the final
judgment, existing residents of the Companys Property in San Rafael will be able to continue to pay site rent as if the Ordinance were to remain in effect for a period of ten years, enforcement of the Ordinance was immediately enjoined with
respect to new residents of the Property, and the Ordinance will expire entirely ten years from the June 30, 2009 date of judgment.

The City and the residents association (which intervened in the
case) appealed, and the Company cross-appealed. The briefing has been completed, but a date for oral argument remains to be set by the Court of Appeals.  City of Santee  In June 2003, the Company won a judgment
against the City of Santee in California Superior Court (Case No. 777094). The effect of the judgment was to invalidate, on state law grounds, two rent control ordinances the City of Santee had enforced against the Company and other property
owners. However, the Court allowed the City to continue to enforce a rent control ordinance that predated the two invalid ordinances (the prior ordinance). As a result of the judgment the Company was entitled to collect a one-time rent
increase based upon the difference in annual adjustments between the invalid ordinance(s) and the prior ordinance and to adjust its base rents to reflect what the Company could have charged had the prior ordinance been continually in effect. The
City of Santee appealed the judgment. The City and the tenant association also each sued the Company in separate actions alleging that the rent adjustments pursuant to the judgment violated the prior ordinance (Case Nos. GIE 020887 and GIE 020524),
sought to rescind the rent adjustments, and sought refunds of amounts paid, and penalties and damages in these separate actions. As a result of further proceedings and a series of appeals and remands, the Company was required to and did release the
additional rents to the tenant associations counsel for disbursement to the tenants, and the Company has ceased collecting the disputed rent amounts.  The tenant association continued to seek damages, penalties and fees in their separate action based on the same claims the City made on the tenants behalf in the Citys case. The Company moved
for judgment on the pleadings in the tenant associations case on the ground that the tenant associations case is moot in light of the result in the Citys case. On November 6, 2008, the Court granted the Companys motion
for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The tenant association appealed. In June 2010, the Court of Appeal remanded the case for further proceedings, ruling that (i) the mootness finding was not correct when entered but could be
reasserted after the amounts held in escrow have been disbursed to the residents; (ii) there is no basis for the tenant associations punitive damage claim or its claim under the California Mobile Home Residency Law; and (iii) the
trial court should consider certain of the tenant associations other claims. On remand, on December 12, 2011, the Court granted the Companys motion for summary judgment and denied the tenant associations motion for summary
judgment. On January 9, 2012, the Court entered judgment in favor of the Company, specifying that the tenant association shall recover nothing. On January 26, 2012, the Court set March 30, 2012 as the date for hearing the
Companys motion for attorneys fees and the tenant associations motion to reduce the Companys claim for costs. On February 17, 2012, the tenant association served notice of its intention to request that the Court set
aside the judgment.  In addition, the Company sued the City of Santee in federal court alleging all three of
the ordinances are unconstitutional under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. On October 13, 2010, the District Court: (1) dismissed the Companys claims without prejudice on the ground that they
were not ripe because the Company had not filed and received from the City a final decision on a rent increase petition, and (2) found that those claims are not foreclosed by any of the state court rulings. On November 10, 2010, the
Company filed a notice of appeal from the District Courts ruling dismissing the Companys claims. On April 20, 2011, the appeal was voluntarily dismissed pursuant to stipulation of the parties. 
In order to ripen its claims, the Company filed a rent increase petition with the City. At a hearing held on
October 6, 2011, the Citys Manufactured Home Fair Practices Commission voted to deny that petition, and

subsequently entered written findings denying it. The Company appealed that determination to the Santee City Council, which on January 25, 2012 voted to deny the appeal. In view of that
adverse final decision on its rent increase petition, on January 31, 2012 the Company filed a new complaint in federal court alleging that the Citys ordinance effectuates a regulatory and private taking of the Companys property and
is unconstitutional under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. On February 1, 2012, the Company also filed in state court a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus seeking orders correcting and vacating
the decisions of the City and its Manufactured Home Fair Practices Commission, and directing that the Companys rent increase petition be granted.  Colony Park  On December 1, 2006, a group of tenants
at the Companys Colony Park Property in Ceres, California filed a complaint in the California Superior Court for Stanislaus County alleging that the Company had failed to properly maintain the Property and had improperly reduced the services
provided to the tenants, among other allegations. The Company answered the complaint by denying all material allegations and filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief and damages. The case proceeded in Superior Court because the Companys
motion to compel arbitration was denied and the denial was upheld on appeal. Trial of the case began on July 27, 2010. After just over three months of trial in which the plaintiffs asked the jury to award a total of approximately $6.8 million
in damages, the jury rendered verdicts awarding a total of less than $44,000 to six out of the 72 plaintiffs, and awarding nothing to the other 66 plaintiffs. The plaintiffs who were awarded nothing filed a motion for a new trial or
alternatively for judgment notwithstanding the jurys verdict, which the Court denied on February 14, 2011. All but 3 of the 66 plaintiffs to whom the jury awarded nothing have appealed, and the appeal is in the briefing stage. 
By orders entered on December 14, 2011, the Court awarded the Company approximately $2.0 million in attorneys
fees and other costs jointly and severally against the plaintiffs to whom the jury awarded nothing, and awarded no attorneys fees or costs to either side with respect to the six plaintiffs to whom the jury awarded less than $44,000. Plaintiffs
have filed an appeal from the approximately $2.0 million award to the Company of attorneys fees and other costs.  California Hawaiian
 On April 30, 2009, a group of tenants at the Companys California Hawaiian Property in San Jose,
California filed a complaint in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County alleging that the Company has failed to properly maintain the Property and has improperly reduced the services provided to the tenants, among other allegations. The
Company moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, to dismiss the case, and to strike portions of the complaint. By order dated October 8, 2009, the Court granted the Companys motion to compel arbitration and stayed the court
proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. The plaintiffs filed with the Court of Appeal a petition for a writ seeking to overturn the trial courts arbitration and stay orders. On May 10, 2011, the Court of Appeal granted the
petition and ordered the trial court to vacate its order compelling arbitration and to restore the matter to its litigation calendar for further proceedings. On May 24, 2011, the Company filed a petition for rehearing requesting the Court of
Appeal to reconsider its May 10, 2011 decision. On June 8, 2011, the Court of Appeal denied the petition for rehearing. On June 16, 2011, the Company filed with the California Supreme Court a petition for review of the Court of
Appeals decision. On August 17, 2011, the California Supreme Court denied the petition for review. The Company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend the litigation. 
Hurricane Claim Litigation  On June 22, 2007, the Company filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (Case No. 07CH16548), against its insurance carriers, Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Essex Insurance
Company,

Lexington Insurance Company and Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company, regarding a coverage dispute arising from losses suffered by the Company as a result of hurricanes that occurred in
Florida in 2004 and 2005. The Company also brought claims against Aon Risk Services, Inc. of Illinois (Aon), the Companys former insurance broker, regarding the procurement of appropriate insurance coverage for the Company. The
Company is seeking declaratory relief establishing the coverage obligations of its carriers, as well as a judgment for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair settlement practices and, as to Aon, for failure
to provide ordinary care in the selling and procuring of insurance. The claims involved in this action are approximately $11 million.  In response to motions to dismiss, the trial court dismissed: (1) the requests for declaratory relief as being duplicative of the claims for breach of contract and (2) certain of the breach of
contract claims as being not ripe until the limits of underlying insurance policies have been exhausted. On or about January 28, 2008, the Company filed its Second Amended Complaint (SAC), which the insurers answered. In response to
the courts dismissal of the SACs claims against Aon, the Company ultimately filed, on February 2, 2009, a new Count VIII against Aon alleging a claim for breach of contract, which Aon answered. In January 2010, the parties engaged
in a settlement mediation, which did not result in a settlement. In June 2010, the Company filed motions for partial summary judgment against the insurance companies seeking a finding that our hurricane debris cleanup costs are within the extra
expense coverage of our excess insurance policies. On December 13, 2010, the Court granted the motion. Discovery is proceeding with respect to various remaining issues, including the amounts of the debris cleanup costs the Company is entitled
to collect pursuant to the Courts order granting the Company partial summary judgment.  The Company has
entered settlements of its claims with certain of the insurers and also received additional payments from certain of the insurers since filing the lawsuit, collectively totaling approximately $7.4 million. 
California and Washington Wage Claim Class Actions  On October 16, 2008, the Company was served with a class action lawsuit in California state court filed by a single named plaintiff. The suit alleges that, at the time of the PA Transaction, the
Company and other named defendants willfully failed to pay former California employees of Privileged Access and its affiliates (PA) who became employees of the Company all of the wages they earned during their employment with PA,
including accrued vacation time. The suit also alleges that the Company improperly stripped those employees of their seniority. The suit asserts claims for alleged violation of the California Labor Code; alleged violation of the
California Business & Professions Code and for alleged unfair business practices; alleged breach of contract; alleged breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing; and for alleged unjust enrichment. The original complaint sought, among
other relief, compensatory and statutory damages; restitution; pre-judgment and post-judgment interest; attorneys fees, expenses and costs; penalties; and exemplary and punitive damages. The complaint did not specify a dollar amount sought.
The Court granted in part without leave to amend and in part with leave to amend the Companys motions seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs original complaint and various amended complaints. Discovery proceeded on the remaining claims in
the third amended complaint. On February 15, 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On June 22, 2011, the Court determined the content of the class notice. 
On December 16, 2008, the Company was served with a class action lawsuit in Washington state court filed by a single
named plaintiff, represented by the same counsel as the plaintiff in the California class action. The complaint asserts on behalf of a putative class of Washington employees of PA who became employees of the Company substantially similar allegations
as are alleged in the California class action. The Company moved to

dismiss the complaint. On April 3, 2009, the court dismissed: (1) the first cause of action, which alleged a claim under the Washington Labor Code for failure to pay accrued vacation
time; (2) the second cause of action, which alleged a claim under the Washington Labor Code for unpaid wages on termination; (3) the third cause of action, which alleged a claim under the Washington Labor Code for payment of wages less
than entitled; and (4) the fourth cause of action, which alleged a claim under the Washington Consumer Protection Act. The court did not dismiss the fifth cause of action for breach of contract, the sixth cause of action for breach of the duty
of good faith and fair dealing; or the seventh cause of action for unjust enrichment. On May 22, 2009, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment on the causes of action not previously dismissed, which was denied. With leave of court, the
plaintiff filed an amended complaint, the material allegations of which the Company denied in an answer filed on September 11, 2009. On July 30, 2010, the named plaintiff died as a result of an unrelated accident. 
On November 22, 2011, the parties agreed to a settlement, which remains subject to court approval and other
conditions, the principal terms of which are that, without admitting any liability, the Company would pay $0.5 million in cash, would provide one week of vacation to the vacation balance of any class member who on August 13, 2008 had at least
five years of service with a PA affiliate (the cost of which to the Company would be approximately $0.1 million), and would receive in exchange a full release of all claims, including claims for attorneys fees and costs, in both the California
and Washington Class Actions.    Membership Class Action 
On July 29, 2011, the Company was served with a class action lawsuit in California state court filed by two named
plaintiffs, who are husband and wife. Among other allegations, the suit alleges that the plaintiffs purchased a membership in the Companys Thousand Trails network of campgrounds and paid annual dues; that they were unable to make a reservation
to utilize one of the campgrounds because, they were told, their membership did not permit them to utilize that particular campground; that the Company failed to comply with the written disclosure requirements of various states membership
camping statutes; that the Company misrepresented that it provides a money-back guaranty; and that the Company misrepresented that the campgrounds or portions of the campgrounds would be limited to use by members. 
Allegedly on behalf of between 100,000 and 200,000 putative class members, the suit asserts claims for
alleged violation of: (1) the California Civil Code §§ 1812.300, et seq.; (2) the Arizona Revised Statutes §§ 32-2198, et seq.; (3) Chapter 222 of the Texas Property Code; (4) Florida Code §§
509.001, et seq.; (5) Chapter 119B of the Nevada Administrative Code; (6) Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq., (7) Business & Professions Code §§ 17500; (8) FraudIntentional
Misrepresentation and False Promise; (9) FraudOmission; (10) Negligent Misrespresentation; and (11) Unjust Enrichment. The complaint seeks, among other relief, rescission of the membership agreements and refund of the member
dues of plaintiffs and all others who purchased a membership from or paid membership dues to the Company since July 21, 2007; general and special compensatory damages; reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses of suit; punitive and
exemplary damages; a permanent injunction against the complained of conduct; and pre-judgment interest.  On
August 19, 2011, the Company filed an answer generally denying the allegations of the complaint, and asserting affirmative defenses. On August 23, 2011, the Company removed the case from the California state court to the federal district
court in San Jose. The Company will vigorously defend the lawsuit.

Other  The Company is involved in various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, notices, consent decrees,
information requests, and additional permit requirements and other similar enforcement actions by governmental agencies relating to the Companys water and wastewater treatment plants and other waste treatment facilities. Additionally, in the
ordinary course of business, the Companys operations are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. Management believes that all proceedings herein described or referred to, taken together, are not expected to have a material adverse
impact on the Company. In addition, to the extent any such proceedings or audits relate to newly acquired Properties, the Company considers any potential indemnification obligations of sellers in favor of the Company. 
Note 19Acquisitions 
On May 31, 2011, the Companys operating partnership entered into purchase and other
agreements (the Purchase Agreements) to acquire a portfolio of 75 manufactured home communities and one RV resort (the Acquisition Properties) containing 31,167 sites on approximately 6,500 acres located in 16 states
(primarily located in Florida and the northeastern region of the United States) and certain manufactured homes and loans secured by manufactured homes located at the Acquisition Properties which the Company refers to as the Home Related
Assets for a stated purchase price of $1.43 billion (the Acquisition). Transaction costs associated with the Acquisition of approximately $18.5 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year
ended December 31, 2011, the Acquisition Properties, revenues included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Company were approximately $60.0 million. 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company closed on 75 of the Acquisition Properties and certain Home
Related Assets associated with such 75 Acquisition Properties for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. The Company funded the purchase price of this closing with (i) the issuance of 1,708,276 shares of its common stock, to the seller
with an aggregate value of approximately $111 million, (ii) the issuance of 1,740,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the seller with an aggregate value of approximately $113 million, (iii) the assumption of mortgage
debt secured by 35 Acquisition Properties with an aggregate value of approximately $548 million, (iv) the net proceeds of approximately $344 million, net of offering costs, from a common stock offering of 6,037,500 shares,
(v) approximately $200 million of cash from the Term Loan the Company closed on July 1, 2011, and (vi) approximately $200 million of cash from new secured financings originated during the third quarter of 2011. The assumed mortgage
debt has stated interest rates ranging from 4.65% to 8.87% per annum and matures from dates ranging from 2012 to 2023.  The Company is in the process of allocating the purchase price and has engaged a third-party to assist with its allocation for the Acquisition. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2011, which we determined using level two and level three inputs (amounts in thousands). The fair value is a preliminary estimate
and may be adjusted within one-year of the Acquisition in accordance with FASB ASC 805.

 The allocation of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has changed
from the allocation reported in Note 13Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, filed with the SEC on November 8,
2011, due primarily to reclassification adjustments for presentation adjustments to our valuation assumption and portions of the acquisition which closed subsequent to the third quarter filing. The changes to our valuation assumptions were based on
more recent information concerning the subject assets and liabilities. None of these changes had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The face value of the Chattel Loans at the time of acquisition was approximately $107.9 million and the variance between the face amount and fair value is due to a number of factors including customer
delinquency status, FICO scores, original down payment amount and below market stated interest rates. In estimating its cash flows from these Chattel Loans, the Company currently is making certain assumptions regarding annual default rates and the
value of the repossessed property upon default in order to determine our estimated interest rate that is applied to the net carrying value. Through December 31, 2011, the credit performance of these Chattel Loans has generally been consistent with
the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value, and the Companys original expectations regarding the amounts and timing of future cash flows has not changed. 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of asset acquired and liability
assumed in the Acquisition.  LandMarket approach based on similar, but not identical, transactions in the
market. Adjustments to comparable sales based on both the quantitative and qualitative data.  Depreciable
propertyCost approach based on market comparable data to replace adjusted for local variations, inflation and other factors.  Manufactured homesSales comparison approach based on market prices for similar homes adjusted for differences in age or size. Manufactured homes are included on the Companys Consolidated
Balance Sheets in buildings and other depreciable property.

Note 19Acquisitions (continued) 
 
In-place leasesLease in place was determined via a combination of
estimates of market rental rates and expense reimbursement levels as well as an estimate of the length of time required to replace each lease.  Notes receivableIncome approach based on discounted cash flows discounting contractual cash flows at a market rate adjusted based on particular notes or note holders down payment, FICO
score and delinquency status.  Below market ground leasesValue of asset (below market lease) based on
contract rent and option price against market rent and land value. Market rent determined applying a reasonable rate of return to the value of the land as if owned. Land value is estimated and then inflated until it is anticipated that the option
will be exercised. Land value is estimated and then inflated until it is anticipated that the option will be exercised. Below market ground leases are included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in escrow deposits and other assets.
 Mortgage notes payableIncome approach based on discounted cash flows comparing contractual cash flows to
cash flows of identical debt discounted based on market rates.  The following unaudited pro forma consolidated
results of operations assumes that the Acquisition for the 75 Acquisition Properties and related debt and equity issuances had occurred on January 1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma results of operations is based upon historical financial
statements. The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of the Company would have been, nor do they purport to predict the results of operations of future periods.

1. 
 The following expenses, except for f. below, are not reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Results of Operations as they are either short-term in
nature or are not reflective of the historical results of the Company or the seller:   


 
a.
 The Company entered into a property management agreement with the seller for a fee of four percent of property revenues beginning on July 1,
2011 and ending on September 30, 2011 for the Acquisition Properties purchased between July 1, 2011 and September 1, 2011.   


 
b.
 The Company entered into a loan servicing agreement, effective July 1, 2011, with respect to the Chattel Loans the Company acquired in the
Acquisition. The loan servicing fee was $55,000 per month and expired on September 30, 2011.   


 
c.
 The Company has estimated that its annual incremental property management expenses associated with the Acquisition are approximately $5.5 million.
  


 
d.
 The Company has estimated that its annual incremental general and administrative expenses associated with the Acquisition, including Chattel Loan
servicing, are approximately $1.6 million.   


 
e.
 Transaction costs related to the Acquisition are not expected to have a continuing impact and therefore have been excluded from these pro forma
results.

f.
 For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company has estimated the amortization expense of an intangible asset for in-place leases to be
approximately $73.6 million. The estimated useful life for acquired in-place leases is one year.   


2. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Companys weighted average of approximately 4.7 million common OP Units (which were
dilutive to the Companys historical operations) were anti-dilutive, and therefore were excluded from the computation of the Pro Forma Earnings per Common ShareFully Diluted. 
Note 20Reportable Segments 
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker evaluates and assesses performance on a monthly basis. Segment operating performance is measured on Net Operating Income
(NOI). NOI is defined as total operations revenues less total operations expenses. Segments are assessed before interest income, depreciation and amortization of in-place leases. 
The Company has two reportable segments, which are the Property Operations and Home Sales and Rentals Operations
Segments. The Property Operations segment owns and operates land lease Properties and the Home Sales and Rentals Operations segment purchases, sells and leases homes at the Properties. 
All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Companys total
revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

 NOTES:   


(1)
 For depreciable property, the Company uses a 30-year estimated life for
buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades, a five-year estimated life for furniture and fixtures and a one-year life for acquired in-place leases. New rental units are
generally depreciated using a 20-year estimated life from the model year down to a salvage value of 40% of the original costs. Used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimate life of the unit with no estimated salvage value.



(2)
 The schedule excludes Properties in which the Company has a
non-controlling joint venture interest and accounts for using the equity method of accounting.
