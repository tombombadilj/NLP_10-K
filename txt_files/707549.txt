Item 1.
Business   Incorporated in 1980, Lam Research Corporation (Lam Research, Lam, we, or the Company) is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Fremont, California, and
maintains a network of facilities throughout Asia, Europe, and North America in order to meet the needs of its global customer base.  Additional information about Lam Research is available on our website at www.lamresearch.com.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, Current Reports on Forms 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are available on our website as soon as reasonably practical after we
file them with or furnish them to the SEC and are also available online at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov.  The
Lam Research logo, Lam Research, and all product and service names used in this report are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Lam Research Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and/or other countries. All other marks
mentioned herein are the property of their respective holders.  All references to fiscal years apply to our fiscal years,
which ended June 24, 2012, June 26, 2011, and June 27, 2010.  Lam acquired Novellus Systems, Inc.
(Novellus) on June 4, 2012. As a result of the Novellus acquisition, Lam has enhanced its role as a leading supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worldwide semiconductor industry. In addition, Lam is better
positioned to serve our customer base by leveraging our technical expertise across a broader portfolio of product to address the increasingly complex business of manufacturing integrated circuits. Lam Research has been a leading supplier of wafer
fabrication equipment and services for more than thirty years by contributing to the advancement of semiconductor manufacturing processes that have led to the proliferation of a variety of electronic products that impact our everyday lives,
including cell phones, computers, memory, and networking equipment. The Companys customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that make integrated circuits for these
products such as DRAM, NAND, and logic devices.  We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor
processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. Our
products are used by every major semiconductor device manufacturer for their leading edge devices. Today, foundry customers are manufacturing leading edge devices at the 28nm technology node. 
We leverage our expertise in semiconductor device processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our
customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and/or reduced cost. Many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest products are also available as upgrades to our installed base of equipment; this is a
benefit that can provide customers with a cost-effective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of their existing wafer fabrication lines.  We are the market leader in plasma etch, a highly critical process step which shapes the microscopic conductive and dielectric/insulating layers into circuits that define a chips final use and
function. In addition, we offer a broad portfolio of single-wafer clean technologies, which allows our customers to implement customized yield-enhancing solutions. With the acquisition of Novellus, we have expanded into the areas of thin-film
deposition and surface preparation which, like single-wafer clean, are process steps often adjacent to etch. During deposition, alternating thin-film conductive and dielectric layers are applied to create metal wiring and insulating structures.
These technologies, together with other process steps, enable customers to build some of the worlds highest-performing integrated circuits. With each successive technology node,

additional requirements and challenges drive the need for advanced manufacturing solutions. We strive to consistently deliver these advanced capabilities with cost-effective production
performance. Lam Research understands the close relationship between customer trust and the timely delivery of new solutions that leads to shared success with our customers.  Our Customer Support Business Group (CSBG) provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance and operational efficiency. We offer a broad range of services to deliver
value throughout the lifecycle of our equipment, including customer service, spares, upgrades, refurbishment of our etch, deposition, photoresist strip, and clean products. While most semiconductor device manufacturers have transitioned to 300 mm
wafer technology, there are still many who utilize 200 mm technology, requiring prior-generation equipment. To address this market and to meet customers needs for high-performance, low-risk equipment, our Reliant Systems Business offers
a suite of new and refurbished Lam legacy equipment.  With the acquisition of Novellus, we entered into the business of
developing, manufacturing, selling and supporting equipment used in grinding, lapping and polishing precision parts used in a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Our primary subsidiary in this area, Peter Wolters, is a leader in the design
and manufacturing of high precision grinding, lapping, polishing, and deburring systems used to achieve a highly precise or smooth surface on a finished material. Peter Wolters products are used in the semiconductor and LED manufacturing
industries, as well as in the automotive, aerospace, medical, and green energy industries.  Lams subsidiary, Silfex, is
a leading provider of high purity custom silicon components and assemblies that serve high technology markets including the solar, optics, and semiconductor equipment markets. In addition to its silicon growing and fabrication services, Silfex also
provides full vertical integration through the development of bonding, precision cleaning and clean room manufacturing necessary in the fabrication of critical components used by its customers. 
Etch Process  Etch
processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. Our etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the
creation of semiconductor devices. These products use various plasma-based technologies to create the desired critical device features at current and future technology nodes. Plasma consists of charged and neutral particles that react with exposed
portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the finely defined features and patterns of an integrated circuit. Etch products are required to remove only the desired films and do so in a uniform fashion
across the entire surface of the wafer. This process is becoming increasingly challenging as device feature sizes shrink, the complexity of the films being removed increases, and the tolerance for variability between devices and wafers becomes
smaller.  Dielectric Etch  Dielectric etch often requires etching multi-layer film stacks. Smaller technology node sizes increase the complexity of the structures being etched, and repeatable on-wafer performance remains critical.
In addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling, device manufacturers focus on reducing overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch multiple films in the same chamber (in situ).
 Production-proven in high-volume manufacturing for the more than 15 years, our patented Dual Frequency Confined
(DFC) technology has been extended to incorporate multi-frequency power with physically confined plasma. The application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched
in the same chamber. Physical confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with the chamber walls, eliminating potential polymer build-up that could lead to defects on the wafer. Confinement also
enables our proprietary in situ Waferless Autoclean (WAC) technology to clean chamber components after each wafer has been etched. Used together, multi-frequency and WAC technologies provide a consistent process environment
for every wafer, preventing process drift and ensuring repeatable process results wafer-to-wafer and chamber-to-chamber.  2300 Flex Product
Family:  2300® Exelan® Flex, 2300® Exelan® Flex45, 2300®
Flex D Series, 2300® Flex E Series 
Our 2300 Flex dielectric etch product family represents a continuous evolution of the productivity and performance benefits of DFC
technology. The 2300 Flex family allows a single chamber design to meet the requirements of a wide range of applications at multiple nodes. Advances in system design, such as multiple frequencies, higher power capabilities and tunable wafer
temperature, meet the more demanding uniformity and profile requirements for applications at advanced technology nodes.  Conductor Etch
 As the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device performance,
a variety of new etch challenges have emerged. For conductor etch, these challenges include processing smaller features, new materials, and 3-dimensional transistor structures on the wafer. Due to decreasing feature sizes, the etch process can
now require atomic-level control across a 300 mm wafer. The incorporation of new metal gates and high-k dielectric materials in the device stack requires advanced multi-film etching capability. Furthermore, the adoption of double patterning
techniques to address lithography challenges, which began at sub-40nm technology nodes, expands etch processing by defining the feature on the wafer and also transferring the pattern into the film. All of these challenges require todays
conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities, while still providing high productivity.

Introduced in 1992, our Transformer Coupled Plasma (TCP) technology
continues to provide leading-edge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at leading edge technology nodes. By efficiently coupling radio frequency (RF) power into plasma at low pressures, the TCP technology provides
capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films. The advanced TCP source design ensures a uniform, high-density plasma across the wafer, without requiring magnetic enhancements that could cause device damage. With a wide process
window over a range of power, chemistry, and pressure combinations, TCP technology provides the flexibility required to perform multiple etch steps in the same chamber.  2300 Kiyo Product Family:  2300® Versys® Kiyo®, 2300® Versys® Kiyo45, 2300® Kiyo® C Series, 2300® Kiyo® E Series
 2300 Versys Metal Product Family:  2300® Versys® Metal, 2300® Versys® Metal45, 2300® Versys® Metal L, 2300® Versys® Metal M  Now in its fourth generation,
the 2300 Kiyo product family combines iterative advances in technology to provide critical dimension (CD) uniformity and productivity for a wide range of conductor etch applications. The 2300 Versys Metal product family leverages
Lams proprietary TCP technology to provide a flexible platform for back-end-of-line metal etch processes. Our etch products perform production-proven in situ etches of complex features. In addition, proprietary pre-coat and post-etch
chamber clean techniques provide the same environment for superior repeatability, as well as high uptime and yield wafer after wafer. 
Through-Silicon Via Etch  The semiconductor industry is developing advanced, three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) using through-silicon vias (TSVs) to provide interconnect capability for
die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer stacking. In addition to a reduced form factor, 3D ICs can enhance device performance through increased speed and decreased power consumption. Manufacturers are currently considering a wide variety of 3D integration
schemes that present an equally broad range of TSV etch requirements. Plasma etch technology, which has been used extensively for deep silicon etching in memory devices and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) production, is well
suited for TSV creation.  2300 Syndion Product Family: 
2300® Syndion®, 2300® Syndion® C  The 2300 Syndion etch system is based
on our patented TCP technology and the production-proven 2300 Versys Kiyo conductor etch system. The Syndion system can etch multiple film stacks in the same chamber; including silicon, dielectric, and conducting materials, thereby addressing
multiple TSV etch requirements.  MEMS and Deep Silicon Etch 
Deep silicon etch is an enabling process for several emerging technologies, including MEMS devices, CMOS image sensors, and power devices.
Many of these technologies are increasingly being used in consumer applications, such as ink jet printer heads, accelerometers, and inertial sensors. This is driving a number of deep silicon etch applications to transition into high-volume
manufacturing, which requires the high levels of cost-effective production typically seen in commodity semiconductor memory devices. To achieve high yield in mass production, the deep silicon etch process requires wafer-to-wafer repeatability.
 TCP 9400DSiE Product Family:  TCP® 9400DSiE, TCP® 9400DSiE II  The TCP 9400DSiE system is based on our production-proven TCP 9400 silicon etch series. The systems patented high-density TCP plasma source provides a configuration to meet the challenges of silicon
deep reactive ion etch. This offers broad process capability and flexibility for a wide range of MEMS, advanced packaging, power semiconductor applications, and TSV applications on 150 mm and 200 mm wafers. In addition, incorporation of our
proprietary in situ chamber cleaning technology provides etch rate stability.  Deposition Process 
Our advanced deposition systems use chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and
electrochemical deposition (ECD) processes to form transistor, capacitor, and interconnect layers in an integrated circuit. Our high-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) and plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems employ a
chemical plasma to deposit dielectric material within the gaps formed by the etching of aluminum or in a copper chip as a blanket film which can be etched with patterns for depositing conductive materials into the etched dielectric. Our CVD tungsten
systems are used to deposit conductive contacts between transistors and interconnects or between layers of metal interconnect wiring. Our PVD systems deposit conductive aluminum and copper metal layers by sputtering metal atoms from the surface of a
target source. Our ECD systems deposit copper to form the conductive wiring on integrated circuits using copper interconnects.  CVD
Technologies  In the CVD process, manufacturers place wafers in a reaction chamber, introduce a variety of pure and
precisely metered gases into the chamber, and then add a form of energy to activate a chemical reaction that deposits a film on the wafers. The CVD process is the traditional method used to deposit dielectric films on wafers. Manufacturers also use
CVD to deposit conductive metal layers, particularly tungsten, as it is difficult to deposit such layers on devices with very small features when using conventional PVD or other deposition technologies.

technology that enables the deposition of very thin seeds for advanced technology nodes. SABRE Excels Multiwave entry and low-corrosion electrolyte also dramatically improve on-wafer performance, reduce cost of consumables, and significantly
reduce production halting defects.  Surface Preparation Process 
Chip manufacturers use surface preparation products to remove photoresist from a wafers surface after the photolithographic
circuitry patterning process to remove any film residues and particles before proceeding with the next deposition step in the manufacturing process. Both wet chemistry and dry chemistry strip processes may be used in semiconductor manufacturing. In
dry strip, a combination of plasma energy and gaseous chemistries are combined to achieve the desired result.  Standalone Photoresist Strip
Products:  GxT®, G400® 
Our family of photoresist strip products are tailored to the specific needs of memory and logic customers. The GxT
photoresist strip system is intended for critical logic device cleaning steps that demand low material loss, full temperature and chemistry flexibility, and ultra-low defect rates. The GxTs MSSP architecture facilitates complex, multi-step
ashing processes, while the ultra-low silicon loss (ULSi) H2-based process provides non-oxidizing chemistries for near-zero material loss. Our G400 system, the industrys most productive photoresist system, is targeted for memory manufacturers and provides
bulk strip and high-dose implant strip capabilities. Enhanced source technology combined with faster wafer heating provides the G400 with industry leading throughputs for bulk strip applications and implant strip. 
Clean Process  The
manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch, deposition, and implantation, which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer. The wafer must generally be cleaned after these steps to remove particles
and residues that could adversely impact the processes that immediately follow them and degrade device performance. Common wafer cleaning steps include post-etch and post-strip cleans and pre-diffusion and pre-deposition cleans, among others.
 As customers transition to smaller geometries, it becomes increasingly more challenging to efficiently remove particles and
residues while at the same time minimizing substrate material loss, protecting structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes, and efficient drying. Similarly, as manufacturers transition to smaller technology nodes, managing
particle build-up on the back-side of the wafer surface is becoming more critical. Single-wafer wet processing provides an advantage over batch cleaning by preventing particles from migrating from the back-side of a wafer to the front-side during
the cleaning steps. In addition, management of potential defect sources at the wafer edge becomes increasingly challenging as new materials are introduced in the process flow.  Single-Wafer Wet Clean  As device geometries shrink and new
materials are introduced, device flows become more complex, and the number of wafer cleaning steps increases. The need to have better control of the cleaning process, to increase overall clean efficiency, and to clean fragile structures without
causing damage are reasons why chipmakers are turning to single-wafer wet clean processing technology for next-generation devices.  Single-wafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those applications where improved defect performance (removing particles without damaging the wafer pattern) or enhanced selectivity and CD
control can improve yield. Over the past decade, the transition from batch to single-wafer processing has occurred for back-end-of-line wet clean applications. More recently device manufacturers have transitioned to single-wafer processing for
front-end-of-line wet clean applications as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage has increased. 
Spin Wet Clean Products:  SP Series, Da Vinci®, DV-Prime®  Introduced over 20 years ago, our spin technology for cleaning and removing films has assisted the industry transition from batch to single-wafer wet processing. This proven technology provides the
productivity and flexibility needed for both high-volume manufacturing and leading-edge development across multiple technology nodes and for all device types. By offering advanced dilute chemistry and solvent solutions in our systems, our spin wet
clean systems address certain defectivity and material integrity requirements. In addition, our unique wafer chuck design provides the ability to effectively clean the back-side of the wafer without damaging the devices on the front-side of the
wafer surface.

Plasma-Based Bevel Clean 
Semiconductor manufacturers clean the wafer edge or bevel to properly remove yield limiting defects. New materials like porous low-k and
organic films often do not adhere as well as traditional silicon or polymer-based films and have the potential to be significant defect sources. By including cleaning steps that target the bevel region, the number of good die at the wafers
edge can be increased to maximize yield.  2300® Coronus® Plasma Bevel Clean
System  The 2300 Coronus plasma bevel clean system incorporates plasma technology to remove yield limiting defect sources.
The system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a wide variety of materials with a proprietary confinement technology that protects the die area. Incorporating our Dynamic Alignment technology on the production-proven 2300 platform,
the Coronus system provides highly accurate wafer placement for repeatable process results and superior encroachment control and is designed to remove a wide range of material types, in multiple applications, throughout the manufacturing process
flow.  Advanced Wafer-Level Packaging or Back End Systems 
3D wafer level packaging (WLP) is emerging as an alternative to traditional two dimensional packaging as the 3D approach
offers a smaller form factor in the final chip package, increased interconnect speed and bandwidth, and lower power consumption, among other benefits. To address this emerging trend, we currently offer WLP versions of our ECD, PVD, PECVD and
photoresist strip systems.  ECD: SABRE® 3D  Designed for advanced wafer-level packaging applications including through-silicon vias, redistribution layers, pillars, under-bump metallization, and
bumping. The systems innovative modular design maximizes footprint density, enables integrated multi-layer processing, and supports field extendibility, making capacity additions easy and cost effective. The SABRE 3D incorporates many of the
same technologies found on the standard SABRE platform, including sealed dry contacts, innovative clamshell and cell design, and SmartDose plating bath control.  PVD: INOVA® 3D  Designed for depositing copper
barrier/seed films for TSVs, the INOVA 3D uses our next-generation patented HCM sputtering source coupled with our IonFlow technology to provide superior copper sidewall coverage and ultra-low defects in high aspect ratio TSVs. The ion-induced
copper flow process enables void-free fill to be achieved while using a much thinner seed layer compared to competitive PVD approaches, reducing the manufacturing cost of consumables for the TSV PVD process step by greater than 50%. 
PECVD:
VECTOR® 3D  Used to deposit high quality dielectric liners for TSV structures, as well as other low
temperature films such as silicon nitride and silicon oxide that are compatible with bonded substrates. The system incorporates technology to tune the hermiticity and electrical performance of these low temperature films to match the film quality
typically obtained with a higher temperature dielectric deposition. VECTOR 3D also uses the same patented MSSD technology that is incorporated into the more than 1,000 VECTOR PECVD systems that have been shipped worldwide. 
Photoresist Strip: G3D  Introduced in 2010, the G3D is a version of the GxT platform designed for advanced WLP applications, including
contact clean and TSV photoresist strip. The G3D photoresist strip system has been designed to quickly remove thick (20-100 micron) photoresists used in the manufacture of redistribution layers and pillars and to achieve residue-free strip and clean
of high aspect ratio TSVs. G3Ds competitive edge comes from a unique combination of high productivity, low temperature processing, and a deep cleaning capability that is enabled by the systems high ash rate inductively-coupled plasma
source. With flexible RF power and gas distribution controls, and a low-temperature processing capability, the G3D affords a wide process window for residue-free removal at industry leading throughputs. 
LED Manufacturing Systems  For the LED sub-segment of the general lighting marketplace, we offer a suite of highly productive deposition, strip, and polishing/grinding process equipment solutions for LED manufacturing. Our products
for LED manufacturing include the L3510® line of photoresist strip systems for de-scum and dry strip cleaning
processes, the INOVA and SABRE systems for LED metallization steps, the SEQUEL® and VECTOR systems for PECVD
deposition, and the AC-1500-P3 double-side polishing system from Peter Wolters for polishing and backside grinding. Our LED manufacturing products are designed for substrates of sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon, gallium arsenide and gallium
nitride, and can be used with wafers ranging from 2 inches (50 mm) to 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter. All systems are supported by our worldwide field service organization.  Fiscal Periods Presented  All references to fiscal years apply to our
fiscal years, which ended June 24, 2012, June 26, 2011, and June 27, 2010. In all sections of this document, the fiscal 2012 information presented reflects 20 days of Novellus related activity. 
Research and Development 
The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. Our ability to
achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to
R&D programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.  Our R&D
expenses during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $444.6 million, $373.3 million, and $320.9 million, respectively. The majority of R&D spending over the past three years has been targeted at etch and other plasma-based technologies,
single-wafer clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing products. We believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us.

Table of Contents
We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers
product needs, support our growth strategy, and enhance our competitive position.  Marketing, Sales, and Service 
Our marketing, sales, and service efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our customers and targeting product and
service solutions designed to meet their needs. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their
wafer processing needs. We maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that
comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace. 
We provide standard warranties for our systems. The warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship
and conform to agreed-upon specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect
or non-conformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired.  International Sales  A significant portion of our sales and operations
occur outside the United States and, therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences, foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls, compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, and economic and political conditions. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows. Revenue by region was as follows:

 Customers  Our customers include many of the worlds leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to
positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities. In fiscal year 2012, three customers, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., SK Hynix Inc., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., combined represented
approximately 50% of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2011, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. represented approximately 24% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2010, three
customers, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation, combined represented approximately 50% of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10% of total
revenues.  A material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected
financial condition. Our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers businesses, in turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated market
demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.  Backlog 
In general, we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers delivery requirements. In order for a system to be
included in our backlog, the following conditions must be met: 1) we have received a written customer request that has been accepted, 2) we have an agreement on prices and product specifications, and 3) there is a scheduled shipment
within the next 12 months. In order for spares and services to be included in our backlog, the following conditions must be met: 1) we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and (2) delivery of products or
provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract
period, not to exceed 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date
changes. At June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011, our backlog was approximately $870 million and $641 million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our

  9 


Table of Contents

customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders, our backlog at any particular
date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods.  Manufacturing 
Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated
into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.  We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more
flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms
documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and
financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for further
information concerning our outsourcing commitments.  Certain components and sub-assemblies that we include in our products may
only be obtained from a single supplier. We believe that, in many cases, we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products. Nevertheless, any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our
operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.  Environmental Matters 
We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business
operations. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business. We believe that we are generally in compliance with
these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being
imposed on us, require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional equipment, or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. 
Employees  As of
August 14, 2012, we had approximately 6,600 regular employees. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. Each of our employees is required to comply with
our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our non-public information.  In the semiconductor and
semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the R&D and
customer support functions.  Competition  The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial resources to continue
to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process
performance, productivity, customer support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, and similar factors. Our ability to succeed in the
marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to
qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular suppliers equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains
that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the suppliers products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty in selling to a given
customer if that customer has qualified a competitors equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of
third-party spare parts provider competition.  We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Our
primary competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc. Our primary competitors in the single-wafer wet clean market are Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and Tokyo Electron, Ltd. In the tungsten CVD, PECVD,
HDP-CVD, ECD and PVD markets, our primary competitor is Applied Materials, Inc. In the PECVD market, we also compete against ASM International. Our primary competitors in the surface preparation product arena are Mattson Technologies, Inc. and PSK,
Inc.  Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering,
manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations than we do. In addition, we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of
their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or
other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future.

Patents and Licenses  Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We currently
hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them.
Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they
alone will not determine our success. Our success depends principally upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our
products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents of others could
require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this report.  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY  As of August 22, 2012, the

Item 1A.
Risk Factors  In addition to the other information in this 2012 Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may significantly
impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements. No priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.  The
Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Subject to Major Fluctuations and, as a Result, We Face Risks Related to Our Strategic Resource Allocation Decisions  The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other
resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information
systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. If we do not adequately meet these challenges during
periods of demand decline, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted. We continuously reassess our strategic
resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and
compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment.  Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. Our
success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.  Future Declines in the Semiconductor Industry, and the Overall World Economic Conditions on Which it is Significantly Dependent, Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Results of Operations and
Financial Condition  Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which
in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns. Global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have
historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers budgets for our products, or their ability to
access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial
condition including, but not limited to:   


 

 
 a decline in demand for our products;   


 

 
 an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers inability to pay us; 
 


 

 
 an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
  


 

 
 valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;   


 

 
 restructuring charges;   


 

 
 asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; 
 


 

 
 a decline in the value of our investments;   


 

 
 exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
  


 

 
 a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and 
 


 

 
 challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply. 
  12 


Table of Contents
Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our
aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in
restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development (R&D) and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive,
which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.  Our Long-term Success, Results of Operations
and the Value of Our Common Stock Depend on Our Ability to Successfully Combine the Novellus Business With Our Pre-existing Business, Which May Be More Difficult, Costly or Time-consuming Than Expected 
On June 4, 2012, we acquired Novellus, and we are currently combining Novellus business with our pre-existing business. Our
future success, results of operations and the value of our common stock depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine our businesses in an
efficient and effective manner and communicate the impact that a business combination will have on our financial statements. If we are not able to achieve and clearly communicate these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the
anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer than expected to realize, and our results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. 
Specific issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Novellus into our pre-existing operations in order to realize the
anticipated benefits of the acquisition include, among other things:   


 

 
 integrating and optimizing the utilization of the properties, equipment, suppliers, distribution channels, manufacturing, service, marketing, promotion
and sales activities and information technologies of the combined company;   


 

 
 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures of the combined company; 
 


 

 
 coordinating geographically dispersed organizations of the combined company; 
 


 

 
 retaining and growing business at existing customers and attracting new customers to the combined company; 
 


 

 
 managing our contractual and business relationships with common suppliers and customers to reduce inconsistent or inefficient effects;
  


 

 
 retaining key employees and utilizing their technical knowledge and business expertise; 
 


 

 
 communicating the inherently complex factors that a business combination will have on our financial position and results of operations; and
  


 

 
 conforming standards, controls, procedures, policies, business cultures and compensation structures throughout the combined company.
 In addition, integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources, the actual
integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than
anticipated. If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate the combined companys operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results Are Unpredictable  Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our
expectations of future revenues. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross
profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: 
 


 

 
 economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;
  


 

 
 the size and timing of orders from customers;   


 

 
 procurement shortages;   


 

 
 the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;
  


 

 
 manufacturing difficulties;   


 

 
 customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, and/or customer acceptances; 
 


 

 
 the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business; 
  13

Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations and Potential Note Conversion or Related Hedging Activities May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition,
Results of Operations and Earnings Per Share  As a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the
assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with the Novellus acquisition (collectively the Notes), we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past. Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could
have adverse consequences including:   


 

 
 impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations;   


 

 
 increasing the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations,
working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and   


 

 
 impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. 
Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial,
business, economic, regulatory and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain
the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could
be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness. 
Conversion of our Notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will
deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our shareholders. This
dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 Notes. Prior to the maturity of the Notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, U.S. GAAP
requires that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. The price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the Notes as a more
attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the Notes.  We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems  System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems are priced up to approximately $6 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the
acceptance of a limited number of systems. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter.  We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers  Sales to a limited number
of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict. In addition, large
customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in increased costs and/or lower margins for us. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the
failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. As of June 24, 2012, three customers accounted for approximately 24%, 17%, and 11 % of accounts receivable. As of
June 26, 2011, three customers accounted for approximately 17%, 14%, and 10% of accounts receivable.  Variations in the Amount of
Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results  We generally
recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to
the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which may vary from customer to customer and tool to tool. Such variations could cause our quarterly operating results to
fluctuate.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change  Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes
subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to
enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability, quality, or design problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service
and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. The expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for
our business. Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. 
In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint
development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of
existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. Moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or
processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices. This shift may result in a reduction in the size of Lams addressable markets. For example, the adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography may adversely
impact Lams served available market.  We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue
Diversification  We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, which we expect
will continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could
therefore be adversely affected by:   


 

 
 a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; 
 


 

 
 a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; 
 


 

 
 export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments;
  


 

 
 an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate; 
 


 

 
 increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines; 
 


 

 
 technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or 
 


 

 
 a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. 
In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their
business than our competitors that offer additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with
technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer steps using our
products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.  Strategic
Alliances and Potential Customer Consolidation May Have Negative Effects on Our Business  Increasingly, semiconductor
manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. The outcomes of such an alliance can be
the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment; while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in
the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. While in certain instances this could work to our advantage, if our
equipment becomes the basis for the function or process as the tool of choice for the larger consolidated customer or alliance, it could also work to our disadvantage if a competitors tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such
functions or processes.  Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions
that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitors equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in
setting up their own manufacturing lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.

We Depend On a Limited Number of Key Suppliers 
We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have
established long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers have sold us products for a substantial period of time,
and we expect that we and they will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, certain of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our
experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability
to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.  Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect  Outsource
providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance
organization. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have
an adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the expansive role of our outsource providers has required and may continue
to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures
could adversely affect our customer and/or employee relationships, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.  Once a
Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitors Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitors Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to
that Customer  Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing
equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line
application for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment for the same product line application. 
We Face a Challenging and Complex Competitive Environment  We face significant competition from multiple competitors. Other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products, which may affect our
ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect
our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.  We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant
financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors, especially those that are created and financially backed by
foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products.
We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. 
In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new
technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of
these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets,
which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.  Our Future
Success Depends Heavily on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations  Non-U.S. sales accounted for
approximately 83% of total revenue in fiscal year 2012, 88% of total revenue in fiscal year 2011, and 91% of total revenue in fiscal year 2010. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total
revenue in future years.  We are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global
operations including, but not limited to:   


 

 
 trade balance issues;   


 

 
 global economic and political conditions, including the ongoing macroeconomic challenges associated with sovereign debt levels in certain Euro-zone
countries and the financial contagion to global markets;   


 

 
 changes in currency controls; 
  16 


Table of Contents


 

 
 differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; 
 


 

 
 our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts and services and develop the necessary
relationships with local suppliers;   


 

 
 compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. export restrictions;
  


 

 
 fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates; 
 


 

 
 the need for technical support resources in different locations; and 
 


 

 
 our ability to secure and retain qualified people in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.
 Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government. Our
failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment
industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Taiwan, Japan, South
Korea, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. This would adversely affect our business with China, Taiwan, Japan, and/or South Korea and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region. A significant
trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.  We are potentially
exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain
of our revenues denominated in Japanese yen and Euros, as well as certain of our spares and service contracts, Euro denominated expenses, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices that are denominated in the related
countries local currency.  We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact
of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated (JPY) revenue and monetary assets and liabilities, Euro-denominated (EUR) expenses and monetary assets and liabilities, as well as monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs (CHF),Taiwanese dollars (TWD), and Great British pounds (GBP). We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter
into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of
those exposures may leave us either over-or under-hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts, we may miss
favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated (USD) assets and liabilities
(other than those currency exposures previously discussed) and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) for these currencies.  Our Ability To
Attract, Retain and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical To Our Success  Our ability to compete successfully depends in
large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and
workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our
overall compensation programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities
and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.  We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation
of Our Business  We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our
business. These information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by
us, our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power
failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. Confidential information stored on these information systems could be compromised. To the extent that these information systems are under our
control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks. However, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our
inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. 
Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax Liabilities 
As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations
governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required 
  17 


Table of Contents

to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the
valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets,
which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material
assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.  A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May
Adversely Affect Our Operating Results  We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the
handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for) all
environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on
us, require us to suspend production, or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial
other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. 
If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our
Financial Performance  An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would
complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or
dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including
difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and
potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or
technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition, and cash flows.  In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations and/or the price of our Common Stock.  The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability
to Raise Capital, Make Acquisitions, or Subject Our Business to Additional Costs  The market price for our Common Stock
is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or
influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:   


 

 
 general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; 
 


 

 
 economic or political events and trends occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions; 
 


 

 
 variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity; 
 


 

 
 variations in our revenues, earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts, or from those experienced by
other companies in our industry;   


 

 
 announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations; 
 


 

 
 government regulations;   


 

 
 developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; 
 


 

 
 technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors; 
 


 

 
 commercial success or failure of our new and existing products; 
 


 

 
 disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or 
 


 

 
 dilutive impacts of our Notes and related warrants.  In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or
anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the
past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert
managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.

Intellectual Property, Indemnity and Other Claims Against Us Can be Costly and We Could Lose
Significant Rights That are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability  Third parties may assert
infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In
addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations
provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam Research. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we
enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of
representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is
our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we
have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles. 
We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our Business 
Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents,
copyrights and trade secret protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration
and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications.
However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. Additionally, even when patents are
issued, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the United States. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents or pending
patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Properties   Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont, California, Livermore, California, San Jose, California, Tualatin, Oregon, and Villach, Austria. The Fremont
and Livermore facilities are held under operating leases expiring in 2015 and the San Jose and Tualatin facilities are owned by the Company. Our Fremont and Livermore operating leases generally include options to renew or purchase the facilities. In
addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support and sales personnel throughout the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in Eaton, Ohio, Rendsburg,
Germany, Chandler, Arizona, and Des Plaines, Illinois. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition. 
 


Item 3.
Legal Proceedings   The Company is either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property claims. The Company accrues for a
liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is
reasonably estimable. These accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the effects of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the
extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, the Company believes that the amount of any such additional loss would be immaterial to the Companys business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

 Repurchase of Company Shares  On September 10, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock and on September 1, 2011 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to an additional $500 million of our common stock. On December 14, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.6 billion of our common stock in conjunction with the acquisition of Novellus, which replaces the
previous repurchase authorizations. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable
law. Repurchases will be funded using our available cash. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  As part of our share repurchase program, we may from time-to-time enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds. During fiscal year 2012
such arrangements included the following.  Cash Enhanced Share Repurchases 
Under cash enhanced share repurchases, we are required to make an up-front cash payment in exchange for the right to receive shares of our
common stock or cash at the expiration of the agreement, dependent upon the closing price of our common stock at the settlement date. During the year ended June 24, 2012, one such arrangement resulted in the receipt of 2.6 million shares
upon settlement at an aggregate price of $100.0 million and two such arrangements were settled in cash for an aggregate of $130.2 million. All cash enhanced share repurchase agreements during fiscal year 2012 were executed prior to the December 2011
$1.6 billion buyback authorization. As of June 24, 2012 there are no outstanding prepayments under such arrangements. Under these arrangements, any prepayments or cash payments at settlement are recorded as a component of Additional paid in
capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Collared Accelerated Share Repurchases 
During the year ended June 24, 2012, we entered into two share repurchase transactions under one master repurchase arrangement. Under
these collared accelerated share repurchase transactions (ASRs), we made up-front cash payments of $375 million and $200 million, respectively, three days after the respective trade date in exchange for an initial delivery of
6.6 million and 3.9 million shares of our common stock, respectively. The number of shares to ultimately be repurchased by us is based generally on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of our common stock during the term of
the ASR minus a pre-determined, fixed discount set at inception of the ASR, subject to collar provisions that provide a minimum and maximum number of shares that we could repurchase under the agreements. 
The minimum and maximum thresholds for each transaction are established based on the average of the VWAP prices for our common stock
during an initial hedge period. We received incremental shares on top of the initial shares delivered such that the total number of shares received under the ASRs after the initial hedge period equaled 8.8 million and 4.8 million shares,
representing the minimum number of shares to be delivered under the terms of the ASRs, respectively. The ASRs were scheduled to end on or before September 18, 2012 and October 9, 2012, respectively. However, each ASR is subject to
acceleration at the option of the counterparty at any time after June 27, 2012 and July 19, 2012, respectively. At the conclusion of the ASRs, we may receive additional shares based on the VWAP of our common stock during the term of the
agreement minus the pre-determined fixed discount, such that the total number of shares received under the ASRs does not exceed the maximum of 10.8 and 6.6 million shares, respectively.

Table of Contents
We accounted for each ASR as two separate transactions: (a) as shares of common stock
acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and (b) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders equity. As such, we accounted for the shares that we received under the
ASRs as a repurchase of our common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per common share. We have determined that the forward contracts indexed to our common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance
with the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASB ASC, and, therefore, the ASRs were not accounted for as derivative instruments. As of June 24, 2012, the aggregate repurchase price of $575.0 million is reflected as Treasury stock, at cost, in
our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  The counterparty designated July 6, 2012 as the accelerated termination date,
at which time we settled the $375 million ASR and received an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received, which represented a weighted average share price of approximately $36.80 for the
transaction period. The counterparty designated July 25, 2012 as the accelerated termination date, at which time we settled the $200 million ASR and received an additional 0.7 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum
shares already received, which represented a weighted average share price of approximately $36.12 for the transaction period.

(1)
Fiscal year 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounts include the operating results of SEZ from the acquisition date of March 11, 2008. The acquisition was accounted
for as a business combination in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. 


(2)
Fiscal year 2012 amounts include the operating results of Novellus from the acquisition date of June 4, 2012. The acquisition was accounted for as a business
combination in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. 


(3)
During fiscal year 2009, a combination of factors, including the economic environment, a sustained decline in our market valuation and a decline in our operating
results indicated possible impairment of our goodwill. We conducted an analysis and concluded that the fair value of our Clean Product Group had been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of
approximately $96.3 million during fiscal year 2009. 


(4)
Restructuring charges and asset impairments, net exclude restructuring charges (releases) included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin of ($1.0)
million, $3.4 million, $21.0 million, and $12.6 million for fiscal years 2012, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Restructuring and asset impairment amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin during fiscal year 2012
related to a recorded obligation not realized for a previously restructured product line. Restructuring and asset impairment amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin during fiscal year 2010 primarily related to asset
impairments for production efficiencies and shifts in product demands partially offset by the recovery of expenses related to previously impaired inventory. Restructuring amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin during
fiscal year 2009 primarily relate to the Companys alignment of its cost structure with the outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities. Restructuring amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in
gross margin during fiscal year 2008 primarily related to the integration of SEZ. 


(5)
409A expense excludes a credit included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin of $5.8 million in fiscal year 2010 related to a reversal of accrued
liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (409A) expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review. 409A expense excludes an expense included in cost of
goods sold and reflected in gross margin of $6.4 million during fiscal year 2008. Following a voluntary independent review of its historical stock option granting process, the Company considered whether Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), and similar provisions of state law, applied to certain stock option grants as to which, under the applicable accounting guidance, intrinsic value was deemed to exist at the time of the
options measurement dates. If, under applicable tax principles, an employee stock option is not considered as granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, then the optionee may
be subject to federal and state penalty taxes under Section 409A (collectively, Section 409A liabilities). On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the Company (i) to assume potential Section 409A
Liabilities, inclusive of applicable penalties and interest, of current and past employees arising from the exercise in 2006 or 2007 of Company stock options that vested after 2004, and (ii) if necessary, to compensate such employees for
additional tax liability associated with that assumption.

Item  7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject
to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those
discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 2012 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in
Part I of this 2012 Form 10-K).  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2012 Form
10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:  Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our
results of operations and our managements assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. 
Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis
of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position.  Executive Summary 
We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits
and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make DRAM, flash memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range
of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in
semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet
more stringent performance and design standards.  The semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has
historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and
foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and
in the semiconductor and electronics industries), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations
during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  Demand for our products
declined in fiscal year 2012 as semiconductor device manufacturers slowed the pace of their capacity expansions in response to weaker macroeconomic conditions impacting demand for certain semiconductor devices. In spite of the slowing pace of
capacity expansion, particularly in the memory segment, our customers continued to invest in leading edge technologies over this period. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers capital
expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices, particularly in mobile markets, and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing.  The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below:

 On June 4, 2012 we completed our acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc (Novellus).
Results for fiscal year 2012 include Novellus operations from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Lams primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue and
cost synergies.  Fiscal year 2012 revenues decreased 18% compared to fiscal year 2011, primarily reflecting the decrease in
customer capacity investments as noted above. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and
less favorable customer and product mix. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily related to continued investments in next-generation research and development and the customer facing activities that
surround and support it and costs associated with the Novellus acquisition and integration.

Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments
balances totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of June 24, 2012 compared to $2.3 billion as of June 26, 2011. This increase included the impact of $1.1 billion acquired in connection with the Novellus acquisition, offset by $773 million of
share repurchases. We generated approximately $499 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $881 million in fiscal year 2011. The decreased operating cash
flows in fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011 were primarily a result of lower revenue, increased investments in research and development, and costs related to the Novellus acquisition.  Results of Operations  Shipments and Backlog

 Shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately $2.7 billion and decreased by 19% compared to fiscal
year 2011. Shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion and increased by 43% compared to fiscal year 2010. The decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for
semiconductor equipment, especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012. The increase in shipments from fiscal year 2010 to 2011 reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments. 
During fiscal year 2012, applications at or below the 45 nanometer technology node were 93% of total systems shipments. During fiscal
year 2011, applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2012 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 45%,
46% and 9% of system shipments, respectively. During fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49%, 32% and 19% of system shipments, respectively. Starting with
the December 2011 quarter we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic/integrated device
manufacturing category.  Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2012 were approximately $870 million and increased
from approximately $641 million as of June 26, 2011. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this report for a
description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog.  Revenue

 The revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in
customer capacity investments. The revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our
installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to

occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $335.4 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to $257.6 million as of June 26, 2011, due to the addition of
Novellus-related activity and increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2012. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance.
Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to
$70 million as of June 26, 2011.  Gross Margin

 The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011
was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume.

 We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer
clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an $18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount, a
$21 million increase in supplies, and an $11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development. Also included in our results are $11 million of Novellus-related R&D expenses that were incurred in the June 2012 quarter from
acquisition date through June 24, 2012.  The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year
2010 was due primarily to a $27 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and a $19 million increase in outside services and supplies related to new product
development.  Approximately 30% of both fiscal years 2012 and 2011 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over
the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies.  Selling, General and

 The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily
to $63 million in expenses related to the Novellus acquisition and integration and $13 million of Novellus related SG&A expenses, including $4 million of intangible asset amortization, incurred in the June 2012 quarter from acquisition date
through June 24, 2012.  The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due
primarily to a $44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and an $18 million increase in outside services and supplies for customer penetration activities.
Rent and depreciation-related expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately $13 million. The increases in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately $4 million of
previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers.  Restructuring and Asset Impairments
 During fiscal year 2012 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.9 million, consisting of a $1.7
million expense related to a decline in the market value of certain facilities partially offset by the release of $0.8 million related to a recorded obligation not realized for a previously restructured product line. During fiscal year 2011 we
incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $11.6 million consisting 
  27 


Table of Contents

primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases. During fiscal year 2010 we incurred restructuring and asset
impairment charges of $24.8 million, consisting primarily of $19.8 million of facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for certain previously restructured leases and $6.0 million of asset impairment charges related to
production efficiencies and shifts in product demands, partially offset by a recovery of $2.2 million related to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps. 
For further details related to restructuring and asset impairment, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 409A Expense 
In fiscal year 2008, following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as
issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic
value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, relating to options that might be subject to
Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million for fiscal year 2008 and an incremental $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement of
matters associated with our 409A expenses with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) resulting in a credit of $44.4 million due to the reversal of 409A liabilities. There were no expenses
or reversals related to Section 409A during fiscal year 2011 or 2012.  Other Income (Expense), Net

 The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during
fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock
transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields.  The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2012 as compared
with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of the $900 million convertible notes during May 2011.  Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance
sheet exposures, primarily in the Euro, Korean Won, and Singapore dollar.  Other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as
compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increased charitable contributions.  Income Tax Expense 
Our annual income tax expense was $35.7 million, $77.1 million, and $83.5 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was 17.5%, 9.6%, and 19.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income, the change in
geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, decrease in federal R&D tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2011, increase in non-deductible stock based compensation, and non-deductible
acquisition costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, tax benefits related to the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits, and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal R&D tax credit.  Deferred Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily
of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $253.7 million and $160.6 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax
liabilities of $285.6 million and $45.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in the
gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2012 and 2011 is primarily as a result of our acquisition of Novellus.

Table of Contents
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively
impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in
the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2012 and 2011
valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets.  At
our fiscal year end of June 24, 2012 we continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor
apportionment election. Additionally, we recorded valuation allowance related to tax assets established in purchase price accounting. We released valuation allowance on certain foreign entities deferred tax assets due to an increase in the
forecasted income and indefinite net operating loss carryforward period in those jurisdictions.  We evaluate the realizability
of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.  Uncertain Tax
Positions  We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but
not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional
charge to the tax provision.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires
management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We
based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates.  The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements
are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on
our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 
We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance, completed our
system installation obligations, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing
acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably
demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer
acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a
stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize
revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service
contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or
deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Inventory Valuation: Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each
product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point
of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of
title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance.  We reassess standard costs as
needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of
manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. We eliminate all intercompany profits related to
the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  29 


Table of Contents
Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements
estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, managements forecasts related to our future
manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections,
additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.  Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard
warranties for our systems. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to
specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and
labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.  Actual
warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we
may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and
warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred.  Equity-based Compensation  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income.
We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (RSUs) based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards,
and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.  We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax
credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in
paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax
credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for
the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. 
Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and
other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is
made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. 
We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected
in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.  We
recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the
two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on
audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is
inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but
not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional
charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill
represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units. We test
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 
  30 


Table of Contents
We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of
impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill
relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting
units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying
value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally
generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. Beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill
impairment analysis, we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Under the revised guidance, an entity is no longer required to
calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. 
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the
analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market
participants.  Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available
industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average
cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.  In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including
estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant
judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market
capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. 
As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but
not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the
estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting
units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2011, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the
statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments in this standard require that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but
consecutive statements. This guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of OCI, but will change the presentation of our financial statements. We will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of
our fiscal year 2013.  In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill
for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair
value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2012 and it did not have a
significant impact on the results of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.0 billion at the end of
fiscal year 2012 compared to $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, which was offset by $773 million of share
repurchases.

 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included
the following sources of cash: decreases in inventories of $74.0 million, accounts receivable of $66.1 million, and prepaid and other assets of $43.2 million and an increase in accounts payable of $12.1 million, partially offset by the following
uses of cash: decreases in accrued liabilities of $120.0 million and deferred profit of $9.2 million.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities
 Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $269.7 million which was primarily due to $418.7
million cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, partially offset by capital expenditures of $107.3 million and net purchases of available-for-sale securities and other investment of $52.7 million. 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $692.7 million which was primarily due to $772.7 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by $55.2 million net cash
settlements under structured stock repurchase arrangement (see Note 20 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans of $27.3 million. 
Liquidity  Given the
cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business
outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 24, 2012 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital
expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.  In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our
future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the
required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the
possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  We have certain
obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and include our long-term debt which is
outlined in the following table and noted below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments
as of June 24, 2012, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $274.2 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably
estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Operating Leases  We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for
buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases
provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $164.9 million.
See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Capital Leases 
Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of
payment obligations.  Purchase Obligations  Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including
vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information
technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2012 under these arrangements and others.
For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of
transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid.
 Long-Term Debt  On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes, and collectively with the 2016 Notes, the Notes). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were
issued at par and pay interest at rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the
Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the
conversion of the Notes.  In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal
amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the 2041 Notes). The 2041 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common
stock based on an initial conversion rate of 28.4781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $35.11 per share of common stock. 
During fiscal year 2012, 2011, and 2010 we made $5.3 million, $4.5 million, and $21.0 million, respectively, in principal payments on
long-term debt and capital leases, respectively.  Other Guarantees 
We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into
certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2012, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe,
based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.  Generally, we
indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the
sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. 
We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary
course of business. As of June 24, 2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $19.9 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience
and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.  Warranties 
We offer standard warranties on our systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of
system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Investments  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings,
types, and maturities. As of June 24, 2012, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the
cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  Interest Rate Risk  Fixed Income Securities 
Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp
rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We
target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The following
table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or
minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012 were as follows:

 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio
to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a
prudent amount of diversification.  Long-Term Debt  As of June 24, 2012, we had $1.6 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $1.7 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk,
market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our common stock price
decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair
value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.  Equity Price Risk 
Publicly Traded Securities 
The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred
compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the
portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012
were as follows:

Foreign Currency Exchange (FX) Risk 
We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as
beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain revenues denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro,
certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices denominated in the related countries local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward
contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure, Euro-denominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities, as well as
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs, Taiwanese dollars, and Great British pounds. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. 
To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated expenses, we enter into
foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with
the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter
into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen, Euros, Swiss franc, Taiwanese dollar, and Great British pound -denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the U.S. dollar.
The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also
recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.  The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 24, 2012 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the
change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

 The notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are
designated as balance sheet hedges, as of June 24, 2012 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges, assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus
10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net, by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the
hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures   Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of June 24, 2012, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.  We intend to
review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to
material information that could affect our business.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control  Integrated
Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 24, 2012 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP.  In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from
their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of
Novellus. The acquired business represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended June 24, 2012 and approximately 25 percent of consolidated total assets and approximately 23 percent of consolidated net assets,
excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of June 24, 2012.  Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this 2012 Form 10-K. 
Effectiveness of Controls 
While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective
at the reasonable assurance level, future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting. The effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to
design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be
guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. 
 


Item 9B.
Other Information   None.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
JUNE 24, 2012 
Note 1: Company and Industry Information 
The Company designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. The Company leverages its expertise in the
areas of etch and single-wafer clean to develop processing solutions that typically benefit its customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost. With the acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc.
(Novellus), in June, 2012, the Company expanded into the areas of thin-film deposition and surface preparation, which, like single-wafer clean, are process steps often adjacent to etch. 
The Company sells its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in North America, Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific.  The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced
periodic downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the
Companys equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and the
Companys ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, the Companys results of operations for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. 
Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current
conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition: The Company
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and the
Company has received customer acceptance, completed its system installation obligations, or is otherwise released from its installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the
Company recognizes revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing
acceptance provision, the Company recognizes revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery
of the separate elements to the customer and when the Company receives customer acceptance or is otherwise released from its customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based
on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not
contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by
a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for
revenue recognition have not been met, the Company defers revenue recognition until customer acceptance and records the deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual
costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company maintains a perpetual inventory system and continuously records the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. The Company
maintains the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in
the terms of sale. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. 
Standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based
on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product
standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between the Companys legal entities are eliminated from its consolidated financial
statements.  Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. The
Companys policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements
estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, managements forecasts related to the Companys
future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market
conditions are less favorable than the Companys projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing
parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company provides standard warranties for its systems. The Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon
revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and
labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.  Actual
warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from the Companys original estimates. While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are
different than its estimates, the Company may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid extended
warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. 
Equity-based Compensation  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and Employee Stock Plans: The Company recognizes
the fair value of equity-based awards as employee compensation expense. The fair value of the Companys restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of the
Companys stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award.
The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and the Company has elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.  Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of the Companys net deferred
tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or
anticipated at the time. In the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if the
Company later determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.  The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year.
Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.  We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is
more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax
assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes
to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.  In addition, the
calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the
interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and
subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not
limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge
to the tax provision in the period such determination is made.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the
amount by which the purchase price of a business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to our reporting units. Goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.  The Company reviews goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, the Company would perform an impairment test of
goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) allocates goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimates the fair value of its reporting units; and
(3) determines the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, the Company is required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can
require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if
any, be determined. Beginning with its fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that allowed it to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative
analysis. Under the revised guidance, an entity no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its
carrying amount.

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires
significant judgment at many points during the analysis. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of
our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Under the market approach, the Company utilizes
information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future
cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. 
In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of the Companys annual or periodic analyses, the Company makes
estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of its reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although the Companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent
with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, the Company makes certain judgments about allocating
shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. The Company also considers its market capitalization and that of its competitors on the date it performs the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could
result in a goodwill impairment charge.  As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of the
Companys goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or failure of the Company to reach its internal forecasts, which could
impact the Companys ability to achieve its forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of its reporting units; and (2) a decline in the Companys stock price and resulting market
capitalization, if the Company determines that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of the Companys reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than
goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, the Company may be required to record
an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.  Fiscal Year: The Company follows a 52/53-week
fiscal reporting calendar, and its fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Companys most recent fiscal year ended on June 24, 2012 and included 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended June 26, 2011 and June 27, 2010
also included 52 weeks. The Companys next fiscal year, ending on June 30, 2013 will include 53 weeks. 
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Cash Equivalents and
Short-Term Investments: Investments purchased with an original final maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company also invests in certain mutual funds, which include equity and fixed income securities,
related to its obligations under its deferred compensation plan, and such investments are classified as trading securities on the consolidated balance sheets. All of the Companys other short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Differences between
the cost and fair value of trading securities are recognized as Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market
prices, and temporary difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities is presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged
against Other income (expense) when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company considers several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited
to: (i) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and (iv) the
Companys ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Companys ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future,
which could adversely affect its results of operation. An other-than-temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security, it is more-likely-than-not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery, or the
security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other-than-temporary impairments attributed to credit losses are recognized in the income statement. The specific identification method is used to determine the
realized gains and losses on investments.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates its allowance for
doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific invoices are deemed to be uncollectible, the Company provides a specific allowance for bad debt against the amount due to reduce the net recognized receivable to
the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. The Company also provides allowances based on its write-off history.   Property and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to eight years.
Furniture and fixtures are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years. Software is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three
to five years. Buildings are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally twenty-five to thirty-three years. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized by the straight-line method over the
shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Amortization of capital leases is included with depreciation expense.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Intangibles): The Company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are
present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows,

appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash
flows attributable to the asset are less than the assets carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the assets new carrying value, which the Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.  Derivative Financial Instruments: In
the normal course of business, the Companys financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Companys policy is to mitigate the effect of these exchange rate
fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated business exposures. The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue and expenses
transactions denominated in Japanese yen and Euros, and net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in various foreign currencies. The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values.
The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company does not believe that it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are large,
global and well-capitalized financial institutions. The Companys exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Euros, Taiwanese dollars, and Great British pounds), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to
maintain the Companys hedging program would not be available in the future.  To hedge foreign currency risks, the
Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts, where possible and prudent. These forward contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange
rates and interest rates observed in the market.  The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of
foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The revenue and expenses are hedged and
designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains
and losses on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. 
Guarantees: The Company has certain operating leases that contain provisions whereby the properties subject to the operating
leases may be remarketed at lease expiration. The Company has guaranteed to the lessor an amount approximating the lessors investment in the property. The Company has recorded a liability for certain guaranteed residual values related to these
specific operating lease agreements. Also, the Companys guarantees generally include certain indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters, potential overdraft protection obligations to financial
institutions related to one of the Companys subsidiaries, indemnifications to the Companys customers for certain infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, and the Companys warranty
obligations under sales of its products.  Foreign Currency Translation: The Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries that
operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily generate and expend cash in their local currency. Billings and receipts for their labor and services are primarily denominated in the local
currency, and the workforce is paid in local currency. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end exchange rate, and income and expense accounts are translated
using average rates in effect for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments and are
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments are recorded in other income (expense), net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. 
Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new authoritative guidance that
increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments in this standard
require that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for
components of OCI, but will change the presentation of the Companys financial statements. The Company will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2013. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will
allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the
entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2012 and it did not have a significant impact on the
results of the Companys annual goodwill impairment assessment.

Note 4: Financial Instruments 
Fair Value  The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  A fair value hierarchy has been established that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The level of an asset or liability in the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities carried at
fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.  Level 2:
Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations techniques for which all significant inputs are
observable in the market or can be corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities and based on non-binding, broker-provided price
quotes and may not have been corroborated by observable market data.  The following table sets forth the Companys
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Table of Contents
The Companys primary financial instruments include its cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, restricted cash and investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and capital leases, and foreign currency related derivatives. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. The estimated fair values of capital lease obligations approximate their carrying value as the substantial majority of these obligations have
interest rates that adjust to market rates on a periodic basis. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the fair value of the Companys convertible notes. 
Investments  The
acquisition of Novellus during the quarter ended June 24, 2012 resulted in increases to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments of $419 million, $641 million, and $1 million, respectively. The

 The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains (losses) for
investment sales and pay-downs are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates and their impact on the present value of the cash
flows to be received from the investments. The Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the assessment of fair value. Net realized gains (losses) on investments included other-than-temporary impairment
charges of $1.7 million, $0 million and $0.9 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, gross realized gains/(losses) from sales of investments were approximately $1.4 million and $(1.0) million in fiscal year 2012,
$0.7 million and $(0.3) million in fiscal year 2011, $0.8 million and $(0.2) million in fiscal year 2010, respectively.  The

 Management has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate any of its cash equivalents and short-term
investments in order to meet the Companys liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase nonetheless are classified as short-term on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair
values. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with financial institutions with the primary objective of reducing volatility of earnings and cash flows related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The counterparties to
these foreign currency forward contracts are large global financial institutions that the Company believes are creditworthy, and therefore, we do not consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance to be material. 
Cash Flow Hedges  In the normal course of business, the Companys financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-US dollar transactions or
cash flows, primarily from Japanese yen-denominated revenues and Euro-denominated expenses. The Companys policy is to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising from the fluctuations in the value of these non-US dollar denominated transactions
or cash flows through a foreign currency cash flow hedging program, using foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as
cash flow hedges and are carried on the Companys balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in
revenue in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.  At inception and at each quarter end, hedges are tested
prospectively and retrospectively for effectiveness using regression analysis. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and are recognized in
revenue in the current period. The change in time value related to these contracts was not material for all reported periods. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating both to the derivative instrument and
the hedged item. These criteria include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged
items fair value or cash flows will be measured. There were no gains or losses during the twelve months ended June 24, 2012 or June 26, 2011 associated with ineffectiveness or forecasted transactions that failed to occur. 
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge and the hedges
must be tested to demonstrate an expectation of providing highly effective offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the Company recognizes
effective changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is realized. Consequently, with the exception of excluded time value and hedge ineffectiveness
recognized, the Companys results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe that the underlying
hedged forecasted transactions will occur, the Company may not be able to account for its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur, future changes in the fair values of the Companys derivative instruments would be
recognized in earnings. Additionally, related amounts previously recorded in Other comprehensive income would be reclassified to income immediately. At June 24, 2012, the Company had losses of $0.2 million accumulated in Other
Comprehensive Income, which it expects to reclassify from Other Comprehensive Income into earnings over the next 12 months. 
Balance Sheet Hedges  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and
payables. These foreign currency forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a component of other income (expense) and offsets the change in fair value
of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, recorded in other income (expense).

Amount of gain (loss) recognized in income located in other income (expense), net.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, restricted cash and investments, trade accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments used in hedging
activities. Cash is placed on deposit in large global financial institutions. Such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Companys cash are creditworthy and, accordingly,
minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.  The Companys available-for-sale securities must have a
minimum rating of A2 / A at the time of purchase, as rated by two of the following three rating agencies: Moodys, Standard & Poors (S&P), or Fitch. To ensure diversification and minimize concentration, the Companys
policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.  The Company is exposed
to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign currency forward contracts that are used to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations and on contracts related to structured share repurchase agreements. These
counterparties are large global financial institutions and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.  Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references and Dun & Bradstreet ratings, are performed on all new customers and the Company monitors its customers financial
statements and payment performance. In general, the Company does not require collateral on sales.  As of June 24, 2012,
three customers accounted for approximately 24%, 17%, and 11% of accounts receivable. As of June 26, 2011, three customers accounted for approximately 17%, 14%, and 10% of accounts receivable.

 The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during
fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was due to the issuance of the 2016 and 2018 Notes (as described in Note 13) during May 2011. 
Note 9: Net Income Per Share 
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method, for dilutive stock options, RSUs, and convertible notes. The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted
computations for net income per share.

Note 11: Equity-Based Compensation Plans 
The Company has adopted stock plans that provide for the grant to employees of equity-based awards, including stock
options and restricted stock units (RSUs), of Lam Research Common Stock. In addition, these plans permit the grant of nonstatutory equity-based awards to consultants and outside directors. An option is a right to purchase the
Companys stock at a set price. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of the Companys stock at the time of vesting. Pursuant to the plans, the equity-based award exercise price is determined by the Board of Directors or its
designee, the plan administrator, but in no event will the exercise price for any option be less than the fair market value of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. Equity-based awards granted under the plans vest over a period
determined by the Board of Directors or the plan administrator, typically over a period of two years or less. The Company also has an ESPP that allows employees to purchase shares of its Common Stock through payroll deduction at a discounted
price. A summary of stock plan transactions is as follows:

 The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified equity-based awards to eligible
employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Additional shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to awards previously granted under the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and its 1999
Stock Option Plan (collectively with the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, the Existing Stock Plans). As of June 24, 2012 there were a total of 3,397,079 shares subject to options and restricted stock units issued and outstanding under the
Companys Existing Stock Plans. As of June 24, 2012, there were a total of 6,529,882 shares available for future issuance under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.  As part of the Novellus acquisition Lam assumed the Novellus Systems, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the Novellus Plan). As of June 24, 2012 there were a total of 4,836,476 shares
subject to options and restricted stock units issued and outstanding under the Novellus Plan. As of June 24, 2012, there were a total of 9,370,943 shares available for future issuance under the Novellus Plan. 
The ESPP allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be deducted and used to purchase the Companys Common
Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the Companys Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable purchase period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and comprises three
interim purchase dates. Key provisions of the ESPP include (i) an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by a specific amount on a one-for-one basis

Table of Contents

with shares of Common Stock that the Company repurchases for such purpose and (ii) authorization of the Plan Administrator (the Compensation Committee of the Board) to set a limit on the
number of shares a plan participant can purchase on any single plan exercise date. The automatic annual increase provides that the number of shares in the plan reserve available for issuance shall be increased on the first business day of each
calendar year commencing with 2004, on a one-for-one basis with each share of Common Stock that the Company repurchases, and designates for this purpose, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i) 2,000,000, (ii) one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the number of shares of all classes of Common Stock of the Company outstanding on the first business day of such calendar year, or (iii) a lesser number determined by the Plan Administrator. During fiscal year 2012 the
number of shares of Lam Research Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP increased by 1.8 million. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the number of shares of Lam Research Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP
increased by 1.9 million each year.  During fiscal year 2012, a total of 819,011 shares of the Companys Common
Stock were sold to employees under the 1999 ESPP. At June 24, 2012 10,646,603 shares were available for purchase under the 1999 ESPP.  The estimated fair value of the Companys stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards vesting period on a straight-line basis. The Company recognized or realized
the following equity-based compensation expenses and benefits during the fiscal years noted:

 As of June 24, 2012, there was $13.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
unvested stock options granted and outstanding; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.7 years. Cash received from stock option exercises was $1.8 million, $12.4 million, and $13.4 million during
fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  Restricted Stock Units 
In connection with the acquisition of Novellus, the Company assumed 1,291,808 restricted stock units. The fair value of the Companys
restricted stock units, including those assumed upon acquisition of Novellus, was calculated based upon the fair market value of the Companys stock at the date of grant. As of June 24, 2012, there was $117.3 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units granted; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years.

Note 12: Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans 
Employee Savings and Retirement Plan  The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North America. Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 1% to 75% of annual eligible earnings to the
plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company makes matching employee contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of earnings contributed. Employees participating in the 401(k) retirement savings plan are fully vested
in the Company matching contributions, and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching contributions of $5.8 million, $5.1 million, and $4.3 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 
Deferred Compensation Arrangements  The Company has an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain executives may defer a portion of their compensation. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based
on their allocation of their account balance among measurement funds. The Company controls the investment of these funds and the participants remain general creditors of the Company. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits on a
specified date at least three years after the opening of a deferral subaccount or upon retirement. Distributions are made in the form of lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 20 years as elected by the participant. If no alternate
election has been made, a lump sum payment will be made upon termination of a participants employment with the Company. As of June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011 the liability of the Company to the plan participants was $79.0 million and
$62.5 million, respectively, which was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011 the Company had investments in the aggregate amount of $83.2
million and $64.7 million respectively that correlate to the deferred compensation obligations, which were recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  Postretirement Healthcare Plan  The Company maintains a postretirement
healthcare plan for certain executive and director retirees. Coverage continues through the duration of the lifetime of the retiree or the retirees spouse, whichever is longer. The benefit obligation was $19.8 million and $13.6 million as of
June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011, respectively.

 Convertible Senior Notes  In May 2011, the Company issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2016 (the 2016 Notes) at par. At the same time, the
Company issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) at par. The 2016 and 2018 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, based on an initial
conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of common stock).The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 2016 and
2018 Notes were $835.5 million. The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 0.5% and 1.25%, respectively, on the 2016 and 2018 Notes, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning
November 15, 2011.  In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc. (see Note 16), the Company assumed
$700 million in aggregate principal amount 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the 2041 Notes, and collectively with the 2016 and 2018 Notes, the Notes). The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances,
based on an initial conversion rate of 28.4781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $35.11 per share of common stock.). The Company pays cash interest at an annual
rate of 2.625%, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year.  The Company separately accounts for
the liability and equity components of the Notes. The initial debt components of the 2016, 2018, and 2041 Notes were valued at $373.8 million, $345.1 million, and $509.5 million, respectively, based on the present value of the future cash
flows using discount rates of 4.29%, 5.27%, and 4.28%, respectively, the Companys borrowing rate at the date of the issuance or assumption for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature. The carrying values of the equity
components of the 2016 and 2018 Notes were $76.2 million and $104.9 million, respectively, as of June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011. The carrying value of the equity components of the 2041 Notes was $328.1 million as of
June 24, 2012. The effective interest rates on the liability components of the 2016 Notes and 2018 Notes for the years ended June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011 were 4.29% and 5.27%, respectively. The effective interest rate on the
liability component of the 2041 Notes for the year ended June 24, 2012 was 4.28%. The following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized relating to both the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the discount on the
liability component of the Notes during the years ended June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011.

 The remaining bond discount of the 2016 Notes of $60.3 million as of June 24, 2012 will be amortized
over their remaining life, which is approximately 3.9 years. The remaining bond discount of the 2018 Notes of $90.4 million as of June 24, 2012 will be amortized over their remaining life, which is approximately 5.9 years. The remaining bond
discount of the 2041 Notes of $190.3 million as of June 24, 2012 will be amortized over their remaining life, which is approximately 28.9 years. As of June 24, 2012, the if-converted value of the 2016 and 2018 Notes did not exceed the
aggregate principal amount. As of June 24, 2012, the if-converted value of the 2041 Notes exceeded the aggregate principal amount by $2.0 million.

Table of Contents
2016 Notes  The 2016 Notes may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2016, at the option of the holder, only under the following
circumstances: 1) during the five business-day period after any ten consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2016 Notes for each day of such measurement period
was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; 2) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending
September 25, 2011, if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter
is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter; or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after February 15, 2016 until the
close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of May 15, 2016, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
Upon conversion, a holder will receive the conversion value of the 2016 Notes to be converted equal to the conversion rate multiplied by
the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during a specified period following the conversion date. The conversion value of each 2016 Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the principal amount of the note and
2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, common stock (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be
adjusted for accrued interest. Upon a fundamental change at any time, as defined, the Company will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2016 Notes in connection with such fundamental
change. In addition, the holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes upon a designated event at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any.  Concurrently with the issuance of the 2016 Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and
sold warrants. The separate convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are collectively structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2016 Notes and to increase the effective initial
conversion price to $71.34 per share. Each of these components is discussed separately below:  Convertible Note
Hedge. Counterparties agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 7.1 million shares of the Companys common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 2016 Notes in full, at a price of
$63.02 per share. The convertible note hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 2016 Notes or the first day none of the 2016 Notes remains outstanding due to conversion
or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible note hedge in net shares, based on the number of shares issued upon conversion of the 2016 Notes, on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving net shares equivalent to the number of
shares issuable by the Company upon conversion of the 2016 Notes. Should there be an early unwind of the convertible note hedge transaction, the number of net shares potentially received by the Company will depend upon 1) the then existing
overall market conditions, 2) the Companys stock price, 3) the volatility of the Companys stock, and 4) the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible note hedge. The convertible note hedge transaction cost of
$76.2 million has been accounted for as an equity transaction. The Company initially recorded approximately $28.2 million in stockholders equity from the net deferred tax asset related to the convertible note hedge at inception
of the transaction.  Sold Warrants. The Company received $57.6 million from the same counterparties from the sale
of warrants to purchase up to approximately 7.1 million shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $71.34 per share. The warrants expire on a series of dates between August 15, 2016 and October 21,
2016. At expiration, the Company may, at its option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of June 24, 2012, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. The value of the warrants was initially
recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.  2018 Notes 
The 2018 Notes may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15,
2018, at the option of the holder only under the following circumstances: 1) during the five business-day period after any ten consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of 2018 Notes for each day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; 2) during any fiscal
quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending September 25, 2011, if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter; or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
events. On and after February 15, 2018 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of May 15, 2018, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing
circumstances.  Upon conversion, a holder will receive the conversion value of the 2018 Notes to be converted equal to the
conversion rate multiplied by the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during a specified period following the conversion date. The conversion value of each 2018 Notes will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the
principal amount of the note and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, common stock (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock). The conversion price will be subject to

  61

adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Upon a fundamental change at any time, as defined, the Company will in some cases increase the conversion
rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such fundamental change. In addition, the holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes upon a designated event at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 
Concurrently with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and sold warrants. The separate
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are collectively structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to increase the effective initial conversion price to $76.10 per
share. Each of these components is discussed separately below:  Convertible Note Hedge. Counterparties agreed to
sell to the Company up to approximately 7.1 million shares of the Companys common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 2018 Notes in full, at a price of $63.02 per share. The convertible
note hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 2018 Notes or the first day none of the 2018 Notes remains outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the
convertible note hedge in net shares, based on the number of shares issued upon conversion of the 2018 Notes, on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by the Company upon
conversion of the 2018 Notes. Should there be an early unwind of the convertible note hedge transaction, the number of net shares potentially received by the Company will depend upon 1) the then existing overall market conditions, 2) the
Companys stock price, 3) the volatility of the Companys stock, and 4) the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible note hedge. The convertible note hedge transaction cost of $104.9 million has been
accounted for as an equity transaction. The Company initially recorded approximately $38.8 million in stockholders equity from the net deferred tax asset related to the convertible note hedge at inception of the transaction.
 Sold Warrants . The Company received $76.3 million from the same counterparties from the sale of warrants to
purchase up to approximately 7.1 million shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $76.10 per share. The warrants expire on a series of dates between August 15, 2018 and October 23, 2018. At
expiration, the Company may, at its option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As of June 24, 2012, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. The value of the warrants was initially recorded in equity and
continues to be classified as equity.  2041 Notes  The 2041 Notes may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2041, at the option of the holder only under the following
circumstances: 1) during the five business-day period after any ten consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2041 notes for each day of such measurement period
was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; 2) during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Companys
common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter; or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after February 15, 2041 until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the
maturity date of May 15, 2041, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
In connection with the acquisition of Novellus, the 2041 Notes may be converted into the Companys common stock at any time from and
after the later of (1) the date that was 30 scheduled trading days immediately prior to the anticipated closing date of the merger and (2) the date on which we delivered to the note holders notice of the merger, until 35 business days
after the actual closing date of the merger, or July 24, 2012. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the 2041 Notes has been classified in current liabilities in our balance sheet. The excess of the amount of cash payable, if converted, over the
carrying amount of the 2041 Notes has been reclassified from permanent to temporary equity. When the conversion period closed, July 24, 2012, all 2041 Notes not converted were reclassified back to noncurrent liabilities and the temporary equity
was reclassified to permanent equity. During the period ending June 24, 2012, 65 of the 2041 Notes, with a total par value of $65,000, were converted at the note holders option. In conjunction with the conversion, 137 shares of common
stock were issued.  Upon conversion, a holder will receive the conversion value of the 2041 Notes to be converted equal to the
conversion rate multiplied by the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during a specified period following the conversion date. The conversion value of each 2041 Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the
principal amount of the note and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, common stock (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment
in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Upon a fundamental change at any time, as defined, the Company will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2041 Notes in
connection with such fundamental change. In addition, the holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes upon a designated event at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  On or after May 21, 2021, we may redeem all or part of the
2041 Notes for the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest if the closing price of our common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days
prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption.  The 2041 Notes also have a contingent interest payment provision
that may require us to pay additional interest based on certain thresholds, beginning with the semi-annual interest payment commencing on May 15, 2021, and upon the occurrence of certain events, as outlined in the

  62 


Table of Contents

indenture governing the 2041 Notes. The maximum amount of the contingent interest will accrue at a rate of 2.1% per annum, excluding any potential impact from dividends deemed payable to
holders of the 2041Notes. The contingent interest payment provision has been identified as an embedded derivative, to be accounted for separately, and is recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period in Other non-current liabilities,
with any gains and losses recorded in Interest expense, within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Fair Value of Notes
 As of June 24, 2012, the face values of the 2016 Notes, 2018 Notes, and 2041 Notes were $450.0 million, $450.0

Notes has been included in the over 5 year category of this table. 
Note 14: Commitments 
The Company has certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of these are recorded on its
balance sheet and some are not. Obligations that are recorded on the Companys balance sheet include the Companys capital lease obligations. Obligations that are not recorded on the Companys balance sheet include contractual
relationships for operating leases, purchase obligations, and certain guarantees. The Companys commitments relating to capital leases and off-balance sheet agreements are included in the tables below. These amounts exclude $274.2 million of
liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits because the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 Operating Leases and Related Guarantees  The Company leases the majority of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of the
Companys facility leases for buildings located at its Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide the Company with options to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the
Companys facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. The Companys rental expense for facilities occupied during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was approximately $11 million,
$9 million, and $6 million, respectively.  On December 18, 2007, the Company entered into two operating leases
regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. These leases were amended on April 3, 2008 and July 9, 2008 (as so amended, the Livermore Leases). On December 21, 2007, the Company entered into a series of
four amended and restated operating leases (the New Fremont Leases, and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the Operating Leases) with regard to certain improved properties at the Companys headquarters in Fremont,
California.  The Operating Leases have a term of approximately seven years ending on the first business day in January 2015.
The Company may, at its discretion and with 30 days notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to pay the amount of the lessors investment in the
property and any accrued but unpaid rent.  The Company is required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases, to maintain
collateral in an aggregate of approximately $164.9 million in separate interest-bearing accounts as security for the Companys obligations under the Operating Leases. This amount is recorded as restricted cash in the Companys
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of as of June 24, 2012.  When the terms of the Operating Leases expire, the property
subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. The Company has guaranteed to the lessor that each property will have a certain minimum residual value. The aggregate guarantee made by the Company under the Operating Leases is generally no more
than approximately $141.7 million; however, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of the lessors aggregate investment in the applicable property, which in no case will exceed
$164.9 million, in the aggregate.  The Company recognized at lease inception $0.6 million in estimated liabilities
related to the Operating Leases, which represents the fair value guarantee premium that would be required had the guarantee been issued in a standalone transaction. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting
entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balances in prepaid rent and the guarantee liability are amortized to the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the life of the leases. If it becomes probable that the Company will
be required to make a payment under the residual guarantee, the Company will increase its liability with a corresponding increase to prepaid rent and amortize the increased prepaid rent over the remaining lease term with no corresponding reduction
in the liability. As of June 24, 2012, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $0.2 million. 
During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $13.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively, related
to the reassessment of the residual value guarantee for such lease. Accordingly, an amount of $26.7 million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities as of June 24, 2012.

 Other Guarantees  The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors for taxes and general liability under some of its agreements. The Company has entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit its
exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2012, the Company had not recorded any liability on its Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe, based on information available, that
it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.  Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined
conditions and limitations, its customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Companys products or services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price
of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. 
The Company provides guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during
the ordinary course of business. As of June 24, 2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $19.9 million. We do not believe, based on
historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.  Purchase
Obligations  Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over
multi-year periods related to the Companys outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The Company continues to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain
activities, including elements of its manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and
commitments table presented below contains the Companys minimum obligations at June 24, 2012 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following table were limited to
the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these
agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties that could increase or decrease amounts actually paid.  The
Companys commitments related to these agreements as of June 24, 2012 are as follows:

 The change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance
between fiscal year 2012 and 2011 is primarily attributable to the Companys acquisition of Novellus. Realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets is based upon the weighting of available evidence, including such factors as the
recent earnings history and expected future taxable income. The Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that such deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of $55.2 million related to California and certain foreign deferred
tax assets. $22.5 million of the valuation allowance relates to tax assets established in purchase price accounting and is allocated to goodwill.  The provisions related to the tax accounting for stock-based compensation prohibit the recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess benefit that has not yet been realized. As a result, the Company
will only recognize an excess benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, the Company
continued to elect to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation such as the R&D tax credit through the consolidated statement of operations.  At June 24, 2012, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $186.2 million. These losses will begin to expire in the year 2018, and are subject to limitations on their
utilization.  As of June 24, 2012, the Company had state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $ 60.2 million.
If not utilized, the net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year 2013, and are subject to limitations on their utilization.  At June 24, 2012, the Company had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $47.6 million, of which $44.9 million will begin to expire in fiscal year 2027. The remaining balance of $2.8
million of credits may be carried forward indefinitely. The tax benefits relating to approximately $8.1 million of the federal tax credit carryforwards will be credited to additional paid-in-capital when recognized. 
At June 24, 2012, the Company had state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $159.0 million. Substantially all tax credits may
be carried forward indefinitely. The tax benefits relating to approximately $36.7 million of the state tax credit carryforwards will be credited to additional paid-in-capital when recognized. 
At June 24, 2012, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $66.4 million, of which approximately
$34.0 million may be carried forward indefinitely and $32.4 million will begin to expire in fiscal year 2014.

 The Companys effective tax rate on income before tax for the year was 17.5% which was lower than
the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to geographical mix of income between higher and lower foreign tax jurisdictions and recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit. 
Effective from fiscal year 2003 through June 2013, the Company has a tax holiday in Switzerland for one of its foreign subsidiaries,
which is conditional upon the Company meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by approximately $22.3 million, $119.5 million, and $45.9 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and
2010, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per share was approximately $0.18 in fiscal year 2012, $0.96 in fiscal year 2011, and $0.36 in fiscal year 2010. 
Effective from January 2007 through December 2014, Novellus has a tax holiday in Singapore for one of its foreign subsidiaries, which is
conditional upon Novellus meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds. The benefit of the Singapore tax holiday for the Companys fiscal year 2012 results is immaterial. 
Unremitted earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated to approximately
$1.9 billion at June 24, 2012. These earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. If these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to U.S. and foreign withholding taxes of approximately $430.5 million
at current statutory rates. The Companys federal income tax provision includes U.S. income taxes on certain foreign-based income.

As of June 24, 2012, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $343.8 million
compared to $181.5 million as of June 26, 2011, and $190.5 million as of June 27, 2010. During fiscal year 2012, gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately $162.3 million, primarily related to the acquisition of
Novellus. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $278.2 million, $120.4 million, and $153.8 million as of June 24, 2012, June 26, 2011, and June 27, 2010,

within income tax expense. The Company had accrued $25.2 million, $16.9 million, and $18.5 million, cumulatively, for gross interest and penalties as of June 24, 2012, June 26, 2011 and June 27, 2010, respectively. 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is examining the Companys and Novellus U.S. income tax returns for fiscal
years through 2009. As of June 24, 2012, no significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS. The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, with the relevant taxing authorities will occur. In
addition, the Company is also subject to audits by foreign tax authorities.  The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and
foreign income tax returns. As of June 24, 2012, tax years 2003-2011 remain subject to examination in the jurisdictions where the Company operates.  The Company is in various stages of the examinations in connection with all of its tax audits worldwide and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled. It is reasonably
possible that over the next twelve-month period the Company may experience an increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits. It is not possible to determine either the magnitude or the range of any increase or decrease at this time.

Note 16: Acquisitions 
On June 4, 2012 (the acquisition date), the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of
Novellus in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.0 billion. The results of Novellus operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements for the period from June 4, 2012 to June 24, 2012. Lams
primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue and cost synergies. Novellus primary business focus is to develop, manufacture, sell and support equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits, commonly called chips or semiconductors. Customers for this equipment manufacture chips for sale or for incorporation in their own products, or provide chip-manufacturing services to third parties. Novellus also
develops, manufactures, sells and supports grinding, lapping and polishing equipment for a broad spectrum of industrial applications.  As a result of the acquisition, Lam Research issued common stock and equity-based awards, subject to certain exceptions, as follows: 
 


 
(i)
each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Novellus was converted into 1.125 (the exchange ratio) shares of Lam Research common stock, with cash
paid in lieu of fractional shares;   


 
(ii)
 each outstanding option for Novellus common stock held by a then-current employee of Novellus, whether vested or unvested, was assumed by Lam
Research and converted into an option (A) to acquire that number of shares of Lam Research common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Novellus common stock for which such
option was exercisable immediately prior to the acquisition date multiplied by (y) the exchange ratio and (B) with an exercise price per share of Lam Research (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (z) the exercise price per share of Novellus common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the acquisition date divided by (y) the exchange 
  69

ratio. Each assumed stock option will be subject to, and exercisable and vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such assumed stock option (consistent with the terms of the
applicable Novellus stock plan, the applicable stock option agreement and any other applicable Novellus plan) as of immediately prior to the acquisition date; and 
 


 
(iii)
each outstanding Novellus RSU and each outstanding Novellus performance-based RSU (PSU) held by a then-current employee of Novellus, whether vested or
unvested, was assumed by Lam Research and converted into a restricted stock unit to acquire the number of shares of Lam Research common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of shares of Novellus common stock subject to such RSU or PSU, as applicable, immediately prior to the acquisition date by (y) 1.125. Novellus PSUs that vest in connection with the consummation of the acquisition will become fully vested with
respect to the maximum number of shares of Novellus common stock payable pursuant to such Novellus PSU. Each assumed RSU or PSU, as applicable, will be subject to, and vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such assumed RSU or PSU.

 The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected synergies and other benefits that the
Company believes will result from combining the operations of Novellus with the operations of Lam. The $1.3 billion goodwill that was acquired is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. As of June 24, 2012, there were no changes
in the recognized amounts of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Novellus.  Preliminary Pre-Acquisition Contingencies Assumed
 We have evaluated and continue to evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies relating to Novellus that existed as of the
acquisition date. We have determined that certain of these pre-acquisition contingencies are probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date and, accordingly, have preliminarily recorded our best estimates for these contingencies as a
part of the purchase price allocation for Novellus. We continue to gather information for and evaluate these pre-acquisition contingencies, primarily related to tax positions that we have assumed from Novellus. If we make changes to the amounts
recorded or identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the remainder of the measurement period, such amounts recorded will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of
operations.  Acquisition Costs  The Company recognized $36 million of acquisition related costs that were expensed in the year ended June 24, 2012. These costs are included within selling, general, and administrative expense
in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 The unaudited pro-forma results presented below include the effects of the Novellus acquisition as if it
had been consummated as of June 28, 2010. The pro forma results below include adjustments related to conforming revenue accounting policies, depreciation and amortization to reflect the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment and
identifiable intangible assets, and the associated income tax impacts. The pro forma results for the years ended June 24, 2012 include $122 million of costs related to inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, share-based compensation
associated with accelerated vesting and acquisition-related costs, which are not expected to occur in future quarters. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations had the acquisition been consummated at
the beginning of the fiscal reporting period indicated nor is it indicative of future operating results. The pro forma information does not include any adjustment for (i) potential revenue enhancements, cost synergies or other operating
efficiencies that could result from the acquisition or (ii) transaction or integration costs relating to the acquisition.

 Note 17: Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  There were no changes in the goodwill balance during the twelve
months ended June 26, 2011. The balance of goodwill increased from $169 million as of June 26, 2011 to $1.4 billion as of June 24, 2012 as a result of $1.3 billion of goodwill acquired in the Novellus acquisition. 
Of the $1.4 billion goodwill balance, $61 million is tax deductible and the remaining balance is not tax deductible due to purchase
accounting and applicable foreign law.  The Companys goodwill is measured at fair value when an impairment exits.
Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company did not record impairments of goodwill during the years ended June 24, 2012, June 26, 2011, or June 27, 2010. 
Intangible Assets  The
acquisition of Novellus during the quarter ended June 24, 2012 resulted in an increase of $1.2 billion in intangible assets. The following table provides the Companys intangible assets as of June 24, 2012 (in thousands, except

 Note 18: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers 
The Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. The Companys material operating segments qualify for aggregation due to their customer base and similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for procurement, manufacturing and
distribution.  The Company operates in six geographic regions: North America, Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Asia Pacific.
For geographical reporting, revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers facilities are located while long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic locations in which the assets are located.

 In fiscal year 2012, three customers accounted for approximately 30%, 12%, and 10% of total revenues. In
fiscal year 2011, one customer accounted for approximately 24% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2010, three customers accounted for approximately 24%, 15%, and 11% of total revenues.  Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairments  Prior to the end of each of
the June 2008, December 2008, and March 2009 quarters, the Company initiated the announced restructuring activities and management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions under the June 2008, December 2008, and
March 2009 Plans. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the
restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments and certain contractual obligations for facilities the Company ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on managements estimates using
known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as it was determined that these items would
have no future economic benefit to the Company and have been abandoned.  Accounting for restructuring activities, as compared
to regular operating cost management activities, requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas
regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service.

 Total charges incurred as of June 24, 2012 under the March 2009 Plan were $61.3 million. The
facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments, net of sublease income, on vacated buildings and is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2015.  Acquired Restructuring Liabilities  In addition to restructuring plans
initiated by the Company, a restructuring liability of $11.2 million was assumed in the Novellus acquisition related to future rent obligations on unoccupied facilities.  Note 20: Stock Repurchase Program  On September 10, 2010, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of Company common stock and on September 1, 2011 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of Company common stock. On

December 14, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.6 billion of Company common stock, which replaces the previous repurchase authorizations. These repurchases
can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. Repurchases will be funded using the
Companys available cash. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  Repurchases under the repurchase program were as follows during the periods indicated:

Average price excludes accelerated share repurchases that had not settled as of June 24, 2012 as the final price per share for these repurchases was not known
until each transactions settlement date in fiscal 2013.  In addition to shares repurchased under Board
authorized repurchase program shown above, the Company acquired 486,000 shares at a total cost of $20.5 million which the Company withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted
stock unit awards granted under the Companys equity compensation plans. The shares retained by the Company through these net share settlements are not a part of the Board-authorized repurchase program but instead are authorized under the
Companys equity compensation plans.  As part of its share repurchase program, the Company may from time-to-time enter
into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds. During fiscal year 2012 such arrangements included the following.  Cash Enhanced Share Repurchases  Under cash enhanced share repurchases, the
Company is required to make an up-front cash payment in exchange for the right to receive shares of its common stock or cash at the expiration of the agreement, dependent upon the closing price of the Corporations common stock at the
settlement date. During the year ended June 24, 2012 one such arrangement resulted in the receipt of 2.6 million shares upon settlement at an aggregate price of $100.0 million and two such arrangements were settled in cash for an aggregate
of $130.2 million. All cash enhanced share repurchase agreements during fiscal year 2012 were executed prior to the December 2011 $1.6 billion buyback authorization. As of June 24, 2012 there are no outstanding prepayments under such
arrangements. Under these arrangements, any prepayments or cash payments at settlement are recorded as a component of Additional paid in capital in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Collared Accelerated Share Repurchases  During the year ended June 24, 2012, the Company entered into two share repurchase transactions under one master repurchase arrangement. Under these collared accelerated share repurchase transactions
(ASRs), the Company made up-front cash payments of $375 million and $200 million, respectively, three days after the respective trade date in exchange for an initial delivery of 6.6 million and 3.9 million shares of its common
stock, respectively. The number of shares to ultimately be repurchased by the Company is based generally on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Companys common stock during the term of the ASR minus a pre-determined
discount set at inception of the ASR, subject to collar provisions that provide a minimum and maximum number of shares that the Company could repurchase under the agreements.  The minimum and maximum thresholds for each transaction are established based on the average of the VWAP prices for the Companys common stock during an initial hedge period. The Company received
incremental shares on top of the initial shares delivered such that the total number of shares received after the initial hedge period equaled 8.8 million and 4.8 million shares, equivalent to the minimum number of shares to be delivered
under the terms of the ASRs, respectively. The ASRs were scheduled to end on or before September 18, 2012 and October 9, 2012, respectively. However, each ASR is subject to acceleration at the option of the counterparty at any time after
June 27, 2012 and July 19, 2012, respectively. At the conclusion of the ASRs, the Company may receive additional shares based on the VWAP of the Companys common stock during the term of the agreement minus the pre-determined fixed
discount, such that the total number of shares received under the ASRs does not exceed the maximum of 10.8 million 6.6 million shares, respectively.  The Company accounted for each ASR as two separate transactions: (a) as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and (b) as a forward
contract indexed to the Companys own common stock and classified in stockholders 
  77 


Table of Contents

equity. As such, the Company accounted for the shares that it received under the ASRs as a repurchase of its common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per common share. The Company has
determined that the forward contract indexed to the Companys common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASB ASC, and, therefore, the ASRs were not
accounted for as derivative instruments. As of June 24, 2012, the aggregate repurchase price of $575.0 million is reflected as Treasury stock, at cost, in the Condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
The counterparty designated July 6, 2012 as the accelerated termination date, at which time the Company settled the $375 million ASR
and received an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received, which represented a weighted average share price of approximately $36.80 for the transaction period. The counterparty designated
July 25, 2012 as the accelerated termination date, at which time the Company settled the $200 million ASR and received an additional 0.7 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received, which represented a
weighted average share price of approximately $36.12 for the transaction period.  Note 21: Legal Proceedings 
The Company is either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business,
including intellectual property claims. The Company accrues for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the
determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. These accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the effects of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and
other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, the Company believes that the amount of any such additional loss would be
immaterial to the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 24, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation at June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 24, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Lam Research Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 22, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP  San Jose, California

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation 
We have audited Lam Research Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Lam Research Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Novellus Systems, which is included in the June 24, 2012 consolidated financial statements of Lam Research Corporation,
and constituted 25 percent and 23 percent of total and net assets, respectively, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of June 24, 2012 and 1 percent of revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of Lam Research Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Novellus Systems.  In our opinion, Lam Research Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 24, 2012 and June 26, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 24,
2012 of Lam Research Corporation and our report dated August 22, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP  San Jose, California
