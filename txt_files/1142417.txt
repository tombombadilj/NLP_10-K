PART I
 




Item 1.


Business



 
Overview
 
We are a television broadcasting and digital media company focused exclusively on the acquisition, development and operation of television stations and interactive community websites in medium-sized markets in the United States, primarily markets that rank from 50 to 175 out of the 210 generally recognized television markets, as reported by A.C. Nielsen Company.
 
As of December 31, 2011, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 55 television stations and 11 digital multi-cast channels, including those owned by Mission, in 32 markets in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, New York, Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan. In 20 of the 32 markets that we serve, we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to more than one station. We refer to these markets as duopoly markets. The stations we serve are affiliates of NBC (12 stations), CBS (11 stations), ABC (11 stations), FOX (11 stations), MyNetworkTV (5 stations and one digital multi-cast channel), The CW (2 stations) and Bounce TV (10 digital multi-cast channels) and three of our stations are independent. The stations reach approximately 10.6 million viewers or 9.3% of all U.S. television households.
 
We believe that medium-sized markets offer significant advantages over large-sized markets, most of which result from a lower level of competition. First, because there are fewer well-capitalized acquirers with a medium-market focus, we have been successful in purchasing stations on more favorable terms than acquirers of large market stations. Second, in the majority of our markets only five or fewer local commercial television stations exist. As a result, we achieve lower programming costs than stations in larger markets because the supply of quality programming exceeds the demand.
 
The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over-the-air programming to our markets’ television viewing audiences. This programming includes (a) programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated; (b) programs that the stations produce; and (c) first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our primary source of revenue is the sale of commercial air time to local and national advertisers.
 
 
We seek to grow our revenue and broadcast cash flow by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, as well as through our growing portfolio of Internet-based products and services. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations’ strong local brand and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by broadcasting the programming of multiple networks, capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. As a result of our operational enhancements, we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations.
 
Our principal offices are at 5215 North O’Connor Blvd., Suite 1400, Irving, TX 75039. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv.

Operating Strategy
 
We seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies:
 
Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. Based on internally generated analysis, we believe that in over 70% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2011 we earned approximately 30% of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to provide between 15 to 25 hours per week of local news programming. Extensive local sports coverage and active sponsorship of community events further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal.
 
Emphasize Local Sales. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. Additionally, local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters. For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue generated from local advertising represented 73.4% of our consolidated spot revenue (total of local and national advertising revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period.


Invest in eMedia. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of Internet products and services. Our websites provide access to our local news and information, as well as community centric business and services. We delivered a record audience across all of our web sites in 2011, with 35 million unique visitors, who utilized over 231 million page views. Also in 2011, usage of our mobile platform grew exponentially, accounting for over 40% of our page views by year end, and we launched redesigned web sites, ready for the emerging touch oriented platforms. We are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want.
 
Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 75% of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 from our duopoly markets.
 
 
Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to. Our and Mission’s cash broadcast payments were 3.7%, 3.5% and 4.0% of net broadcast revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations. We currently own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including NBC, CBS, FOX and ABC affiliated stations which represented approximately 29.8%, 29.3%, 18.9% and 12.9%, respectively, of our 2011 net broadcast revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NBA basketball, Major League baseball, NFL football, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network programming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio’s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network.

Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets. Our station general managers have been granted stock options and have an average of over 20 years of experience in the television broadcasting industry.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
We selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations primarily in markets ranking from 50 to 175 out of the 210 generally recognized television markets, where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management. When considering an acquisition, we evaluate the target audience share, revenue share, overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters. Additionally, we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets.
 
Relationship with Mission
 
Through various local service agreements with Mission, we currently provide sales, programming and other services to 17 television stations that are owned and operated by Mission. Mission is 100% owned by independent third parties. We do not own Mission or any of its television stations. In compliance with Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations for both us and Mission, Mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of its stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have a controlling financial interest in Mission because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the Mission stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting Mission’s economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. Therefore, Mission is consolidated into these financial statements. We expect our option agreements with Mission to be renewed upon expiration.

Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. Currently a limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by A.C. Nielsen Company, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as designated market areas (“DMAs”), that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. A.C. Nielsen periodically publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in the DMA. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates.
 
Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs.
 
Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, cable and satellite television systems and, to a lesser extent, with newspapers, radio stations and Internet advertising serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the Internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations.
 
Advertising Sales
 
General
 
Television station revenue is primarily derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming.
 
Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks, or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the stations’ local sales staff.
 
Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including:
 




  


•


a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target;



 




  


•


the number of advertisers competing for the available time;



 




  


•


the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station;



 




  


•


the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area;



 




  


•


the effectiveness of the station’s sales forces;



 




  


•


development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and



 




  


•


the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser.

Advertising rates are also determined by a station’s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station’s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations.
 
Seasonality
 
Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns, and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games.
 
Local Sales
 
Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to television and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel.
 
National Sales
 
National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers, and national retailers (some of which may advertise locally).
 
Network Affiliations
 
Most of the stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to as of December 31, 2011 are affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement, as described below:

Competition
 
Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 
Audience. We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station’s programming has a direct effect on the adverting rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to sell their programming directly to the consumer via portal digital devices such as video iPods and cell phones, which presents an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems (such as VCRs, DVDs and DVRs), video-on-demand and pay-per-view, the Internet (including network distribution of programming through websites) and gaming devices.
 
Although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems, such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) systems which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market, have become significant competitors for the over-the-air television audience.
 
Programming. Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off-network reruns (such as Seinfeld) and first-run product (such as Entertainment Tonight) in their respective markets. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Time Warner, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Viacom Inc., The News Corporation Limited and the Walt Disney Company each owns a television network and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary source of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories, unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events.
 
Advertising. Stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets; and other advertising media such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, local cable systems, DBS systems and the Internet. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas.
 
The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. The increased use of digital technology by cable systems and DBS, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services.

Federal Regulation
 
Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“the Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, you should refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, public notices and policies.


License Grant and Renewal. The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 
After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a trial-type hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application.
 
In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture.
 
Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval.
 
Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, a U.S. broadcast company such as ours may have no more than 25% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity).
 
The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations. These ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of qualified investment companies, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules, such as a radio or television station or daily newspaper.


Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations in the DMA with overlapping service contours and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA. The duopoly rule allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station only in cases where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt.

Under the duopoly rule, the FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs a second in-market station pursuant to a time brokerage or local marketing agreement, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, local marketing agreements entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination.
 
In certain markets, we and Mission own and operate both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations (in Utica, Nexstar owns and operates WFXV and WPNY-LP; in Wichita Falls, Mission owns and operates KJTL and KJBO-LP; and in Amarillo, Mission owns and operates KCIT and KCPN-LP). The FCC’s duopoly rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations such as WPNY-LP, KJBO-LP and KCPN-LP.
 
The only markets in which we currently are permitted to own two stations under the duopoly rule are the Champaign-Springfield-Decatur, Illinois market and the Little Rock-Pine Bluff, Arkansas market. However, we also are permitted to own two stations in the Fort Smith-Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, Arkansas market pursuant to a waiver under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station. In all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements, except for two, we do not provide programming other than news (comprising less than 15% of the second station’s programming) to the second station and, therefore, we are not attributed with ownership of the second station. In the two markets where we provide more programming to the second station—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania and KHMT in Billings, Montana—the local marketing agreements were entered into prior to November 5, 1996. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise.
 
National Television Ownership. There is no nationwide limit on the number of television stations which a party may own. However, the FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations. This rule provides that when calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of a UHF station is counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience. In 2004, Congress determined that one party may have an attributable interest in television stations which reach, in the aggregate, 39% of all U.S. television households; and the FCC thereafter modified its corresponding rule. The FCC currently is considering whether this act has any impact on the FCC’s authority to examine and modify the UHF discount.
 
The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of 5.2% of television households with the UHF discount.
 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (One-to-a-Market Rule). In markets with at least 20 independently owned media “voices”, ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations, or two television stations (if allowed under the television duopoly rule) and six radio stations is permitted. If the number of independently owned media “voices” is fewer than 20 but greater than or equal to 10, ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and four radio stations is permitted. In markets with fewer than 10 independent media “voices”, ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and one radio station is permitted. In calculating the number of independent media “voices” in a market, the FCC includes all radio and television stations, independently owned cable systems (counted as one voice), and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds 5% of the households in the market. In all cases, the television and radio components of the combination must also comply, respectively, with the local television ownership rule and the local radio ownership rule.
 
 
Local Television/Newspaper Cross-Ownership Rule. Under this rule, a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper.
 
As a result of the FCC’s 2006 rulemaking proceeding, which provided a comprehensive review of all of its media ownership rules, in February 2008, the FCC adopted modest changes to its newspaper cross-ownership rule, while retaining the rest of its rules as then currently in effect. In July 2011, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC’s changes to the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule while upholding the FCC’s retention of its other media ownership rules.

The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity”. During 2009, the FCC held a series of hearings designed to evaluate possible changes to its rules. In May 2010, the FCC formally initiated its 2010 review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a Notice of Inquiry (NOI). The NOI was intended to assist the Commission in establishing a framework within which to analyze whether its media ownership rules remain “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition,” due to the dramatic changes occurring in the media marketplace. Numerous parties filed comments and reply comments in response to the NOI. In June and July 2011, the FCC released to the public eleven economic studies related to its media ownership rules. In December 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to seek comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules. Among the specific changes proposed in the NPRM are (1) elimination of the contour overlap provision of the local television ownership rule (making the rule entirely DMA-based), (2) elimination of the radio/television cross-ownership rule and (3) modest relaxation of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule along the lines of the changes in the 2006 proceeding that the court vacated. The NPRM also seeks comment on shared services agreements (SSAs) and other joint operating arrangements between television stations, and whether such agreements should be considered attributable. Initial comments on the NPRM were filed on March 5, 2012, and reply comments are due in April 2012.  We cannot predict what rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted.
 
Local Television/Cable Cross-Ownership. There is no FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area.
 
Cable and Satellite Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.”  Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2014, and will be effective January 1, 2015. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.


A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.


MVPD operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC has also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute.


The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals.


We and Mission elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of our stations where we have a legal right to do so. We and Mission have negotiated retransmission consent agreements with all of the MVPDs which carry the stations’ signals.

Programming and Operation. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve “the public interest.” Since the late 1970s, the FCC gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license. However, television station licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. The FCC may consider complaints from viewers concerning programming when it evaluates a station’s license renewal application, although viewer complaints also may be filed and considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things:
 




  


•


political advertising (its price and availability);



 




  


•


sponsorship identification;



 




  


•


contest and lottery advertising;



 




  


•


obscene and indecent broadcasts;



 




  


•


technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation;



 




  


•


discrimination and equal employment opportunities;



 




  


•


closed captioning (and, under recently reinstated rules, video description);



 




  


•


children’s programming;



 




  


•


program ratings guidelines; and



 




  


•


network affiliation agreements.



 
Technical Regulation. FCC rules govern the technical operating parameters of television stations, including permissible operating channel, power and antenna height and interference protections between stations. Under various FCC rules and procedures, full power television stations completed the transition from analog to digital television (DTV) broadcasting in June 2009. The FCC has adopted rules with respect to the conversion of existing low power and television translator stations to digital operation, establishing a September 1, 2015 deadline by which low power and television translator stations must cease analog operation.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of 2,230 employees, comprised of 1,953 full-time and 277 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2011, 155 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Item 1A.                      Risk Factors
 
You should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we believe are the most significant risks related to our business, as well as the other information contained in this document.
 
Risks Related to Our Operations
 
General trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers flock to alternative media, including the Internet, for entertainment.  
 
Television viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media, including the Internet. As a result, in recent years demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing, and we expect this trend to continue.


In recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms in close proximity to network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.
 
 
We and Mission have a history of net losses.  
 
We and Mission had aggregate net losses of $11.9 million, $1.8 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We and Mission may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. 
 
Our substantial debt could limit our ability to grow and compete.  
 
As of December 31, 2011, we and Mission had $640.4 million of debt, which represented 140.1% of our and Mission’s total combined capitalization. The companies’ high level of debt could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could:
 
•    limit our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future;
 
•    limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities;
 




  


•


expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior credit facilities is variable;  



 
•    limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry; and
 




  


•


impair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.



 
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature.
 
We and Mission could also incur additional debt in the future. The terms of our and Mission’s senior credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing our publicly-held notes, limit, but do not prohibit us or Mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt. To the extent we or Mission incur additional debt we would become even more susceptible to the leverage-related risks described above.



  


14





  



 
The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our business.  
 
Our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our publicly-held notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:
 
•    incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;  
 
•    pay dividends and make other distributions;  
 
•    make investments and other restricted payments;  
 
•    make acquisitions;  
 
•    merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;  
 
•    enter into sale and leaseback transactions;  
 
•    create liens;  
 
•    sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries; and  
 
•    enter into transactions with affiliates.  
 
In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios, including consolidated leverage ratios and fixed charges coverage ratios. Future financing agreements may contain similar, or even more restrictive, provisions and covenants. As a result of these restrictions and covenants, our management’s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited, and we may be unable to compete effectively, pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities, any of which could harm our business. Mission’s senior secured credit facility contains similar terms and restrictions.  
 
If we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements, a default may occur. A default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. A default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt.  
 
Our senior secured credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios, including maximum total and first lien ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission. Mission’s senior secured credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however it does include an event of default if Nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement. The senior subordinated notes and senior secured second lien notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type. 
 
Mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements.  
 
Mission is 100% owned by independent third parties. Mission owns and operates 17 television stations as of December 31, 2011. We have entered into local service agreements with Mission, pursuant to which we provide services to Mission’s stations. In return for the services we provide, we receive substantially all of Mission’s available cash, after satisfaction of operating costs and debt obligations. We also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, which were incurred primarily in connection with Mission’s acquisition of its stations. Mission has granted to us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent, for consideration equal to the greater of (1) seven times the station’s cash flow, as defined in the option agreement, less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or (2) the amount of its indebtedness.  


We do not own Mission or its television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have a controlling financial interest in Mission because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the Mission stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting Mission’s economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. In compliance with FCC regulations for both us and Mission, Mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for its stations. As a result, Mission’s board of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and, as a consequence, the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with Mission. For instance, we may disagree with Mission’s programming decisions, which programming may prove unpopular and/or may generate less advertising revenue. Furthermore, subject to Mission’s agreement with its lenders, Mission’s board of directors, comprised solely of shareholders, could choose to pay themselves a dividend.

The revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms, or at all.  
 
Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements––12 stations have primary affiliation agreements with NBC, 11 with CBS, 11 with ABC, 11 with FOX, 5 with MyNetworkTV, and 2 with The CW. Additionally, eleven of the stations have secondary affiliation agreements – one with MyNetworkTV and 10 with Bounce TV. Each of NBC, CBS and ABC generally provides affiliated stations with up to 22 hours of prime time programming per week, while each of FOX, MyNetworkTV and The CW provides affiliated stations with up to 15 hours of prime time programming per week. In return, affiliated stations broadcast the respective network’s commercials during the network programming.


All of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through June 2017. Our and Mission’s NBC network agreements for seven stations expire On March 31, 2012. In order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements. If any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason, we would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive and more expensive. Further, some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances.


For more information regarding these network affiliation agreements, see “Business—Network Affiliations.”  
 
The loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
 
Nexstar’s retransmission consent agreements with cable operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and others permit the operators to carry our stations’ signals in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration. The television networks have recently asserted to their local television station affiliates the networks’ position that they, as the owners or licensees of programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission, are entitled to a portion of the compensation under the retransmission consent agreements and are including these provisions in their network affiliation agreements. In addition, our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include certain terms that may affect our ability to allow MVPDs to retransmit network programming, and in some cases, we may lose the right to grant retransmission consent to such providers. Inclusion of these or similar provisions in our network affiliation agreements could materially reduce this revenue source to Nexstar and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


In addition, system operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (1) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (2) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (3) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC has also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute. If the FCC prohibits joint negotiations or modifies the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, such changes could materially reduce this revenue source and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



  


16





  



 
The FCC could decide not to grant renewal of the FCC license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations. 
 
Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if, during the preceding term, the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 
On October 26, 2005, the Director of the Central Illinois Chapter of the Parents Television Council (“PTC”) submitted an informal objection to the application for renewal of license for Nexstar’s station WCIA in Champaign, Illinois, requesting the FCC withhold action on WCIA’s license renewal application until the FCC acts on the PTC’s complaint regarding an allegedly indecent broadcast on WCIA.
 
On January 3, 2006, Cable America Corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for Nexstar’s station KOZL and Mission’s station KOLR, both licensed to Springfield, Missouri. Cable America alleged that Nexstar’s local service agreements with Mission give Nexstar improper control over Mission’s operations. Nexstar and Mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and Cable America submitted a reply. Cable America subsequently requested that the FCC dismiss its petition. However, the petition remains pending with the FCC.
 
Nexstar and Mission filed renewal of license applications for their stations between June 2004 and April 2008. The majority of these applications, including the WCIA, KOZL and KOLR applications discussed above, remain pending with the FCC. Once a renewal application is timely filed, a station may continue to operate under its license even if its expiration date has passed. We and Mission expect the FCC to renew the licenses for our stations in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so.
 
The loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies. 
 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of Perry A. Sook, our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus. The loss of Mr. Sook’s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies. 
 
Our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy.  
 
We intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations. The television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation, which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets. Therefore, even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful.
 
FCC rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire additional television stations. Television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. FCC rules limit the number of television stations a company may own, and those rules are subject to change. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if, for example, the FCC or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market, even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations.

Growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our growth, our operating results will suffer. 
 
Since January 1, 2003, we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, having acquired 23 stations and contracted to provide service to 10 additional stations. We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities. To manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions, we will need, among other things, to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems. We will also need to continue to identify, attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel. Failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business. 
 
There are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that: 
 




  


•


we may not be able to successfully reduce costs, increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station; 



 




  


•


an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities; 



 




  


•


our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business; 



 
•    we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures;
 
•    we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and
 
•    problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience. 
 
The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition.  
 
FCC actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements, which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy.  
 
In some of our markets, we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements. While these agreements take varying forms, a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station’s owner. By operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market, we (and the other station) achieve significant operational efficiencies. We also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market.
 
While all of our existing local service agreements comply with FCC rules and policies, the FCC may not continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly-type opportunities. 
 
On August 2, 2004, the FCC initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make TV joint sales agreements attributable under its ownership rules. Comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of 2004. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding.


In addition, the FCC is required by statute to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity”. The FCC initiated its statutory review of its ownership rules in May 2010, and in December 2011 it issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in that review. The NPRM specifically requests comment on shared services agreements and other joint operating arrangements between television stations, and whether such agreements should be considered attributable. We believe the FCC will continue its review during 2012 but we cannot predict when the FCC will issue a decision on any proposed rule changes. However, if the FCC adopts a joint sales agreement attribution rule, or any other new or modified rule affecting the ownership of or local service agreements between television stations, we will be required to comply with such rules.
 
The FCC may decide to terminate “grandfathered” time brokerage agreements.  
 
The FCC attributes time brokerage agreements and local marketing agreements (“TBAs”) to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than 15% of a station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, TBAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests for now.



  


18





  



 
The FCC will review these “grandfathered” TBAs in the future. During this review, the FCC may determine to terminate the “grandfathered” period and make all TBAs fully attributable to the programmer. If the FCC does so, we and Mission will be required to terminate the TBAs for stations WFXP and KHMT unless the FCC simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets.


The level of foreign investments held by our principal stockholder, ABRY Partners, LLC and its affiliated funds (“ABRY”), may limit additional foreign investments made in us.  
 
The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, a U.S. broadcast company such as ours may have no more than 25% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). Because our majority shareholder, ABRY, has a substantial level of foreign investment, the amount of additional foreign investment that may be made in us is limited to approximately 12% of our total outstanding equity.  
 
The interest of our principal stockholder, ABRY, in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets, restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy.  
 
The number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by FCC rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under FCC rules. The broadcast or other media interests of our officers, directors and stockholders with 5% or greater voting power are generally attributable under the FCC’s rules, which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers, directors or stockholders are associated with us. In addition, the holder of otherwise non-attributable equity and/or debt in a licensee in excess of 33% of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or daily newspaper in the same market.  
 
ABRY, our principal stockholder, is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments. As a result of ABRY’s interest in us, we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where ABRY has an attributable interest in television stations or other media, which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. Our certificate of incorporation allows ABRY and its affiliates to identify, pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast-related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.  
 
We are controlled by one principal stockholder, ABRY, and its interests may differ from your interests.  
 
As a result of ABRY’s controlling interest in us, ABRY is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs. ABRY is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, five of our directors are or were affiliated with ABRY. ABRY’s interests may differ from the interests of other security holders and ABRY could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our security holders. Furthermore, this concentration of ownership by ABRY may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares.  
 
Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, debt instruments and Delaware law contain anti-takeover protections that may discourage or prevent a takeover of us, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.  
 
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: 
 
•    authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock by our board of directors without a stockholder vote;  
 




  


•


do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; and  



 
•    set forth specific advance notice procedures for matters to be raised at stockholder meetings.  
 
The Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us from engaging in “business combinations” with “interested shareholders” (with some exceptions) unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of this provision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.



  


19





  



 
In addition, a change in control would be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility and trigger the rights of holders of our publicly-traded notes to cause us to repurchase such notes. These events would add to the cost of an acquisition, which could deter a third party from acquiring us. 
 
 
We and Mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets, and therefore we and Mission could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges.
 
As of December 31, 2011, $335.6 million, or 56.4%, of our and Mission’s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets, including FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements. We recorded an impairment charge of $16.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 that included an impairment to the carrying values of FCC licenses of $8.8 million, related to 19 of our stations and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of $7.4 million, related to four reporting units consisting of five of our stations. We and Mission test goodwill and FCC licenses annually, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets, in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets. We and Mission test network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows. The methods used to evaluate the impairment of Nexstar’s and Mission’s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of Nexstar’s and Mission’s television stations, or a forecast of such reductions, a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which Nexstar’s and Mission’s television stations operate, the loss of network affiliations, or by adverse changes to FCC ownership rules, among others, which may be beyond our or Mission’s control. If the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment, such non-cash charge could materially affect Nexstar’s and Mission’s financial position and results of operations. 
 
Risks Related to Our Industry  
 
Our operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising.  
 
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control, including:     

 




•  


the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  



 




•  


the popularity of our programming;



 




•  


fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising;



 




•  


the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media, particularly newspapers, cable television, Internet and radio;



 




•  


the decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years; and



 




•  


changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located.




    Because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns, the reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. Our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership, and we may not achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline. In addition, we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate, and effectively react to, shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets.  
 
Because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed, a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. 
 
Our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs, primarily for debt service, broadcast rights and personnel. Other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies, our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue. As a result, a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.



  


20





  



 
Preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations.  
 
Nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack. As a result, advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed-upon times in the future. Advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods, and space may not be available for such advertising. The duration of such preemption of local programming cannot be predicted if it occurs. In addition, our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack. The loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 
If we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends, our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively. 
 
New technologies could also adversely affect our television stations. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view, the Internet, telephone company services, mobile devices, digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access. Over the past decade, cable television programming services, other emerging video distribution platforms and the Internet have captured an increasing market share, while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined. In addition, the expansion of cable and satellite television, the Internet and other technological changes have increased, and may continue to increase, the competitive demand for programming. Such increased demand, together with rising production costs, may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming.
 
In addition, video compression techniques, now in use with direct broadcast satellites, cable and wireless cable are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth. These compression techniques as well as other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences. Reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming, resulting in more audience fractionalization. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations.
 
The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent.  
 
In 2004, the FCC began to impose substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the Communications Act and its rules. The FCC also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television. In one of several judicial appeals of FCC enforcement actions, a Federal court in July 2010 held the FCC’s indecency standards to be unconstitutionally vague under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed to review that decision and heard oral argument in the case in January 2012. Because our and Mission’s stations’ programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated, we and Mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations, and we and Mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the FCC finds such programming to be indecent. Fines may be imposed on a television broadcaster for an indecency violation to a maximum of $325,000 per violation.
 
Intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and impair our ability to become profitable.  
 
As a television broadcasting company, we face a significant level of competition, both directly and indirectly. Generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television. Specifically, stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share, programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media, including newspapers, radio stations, cable television, DBS systems and the Internet.  



  


21





  



 
The entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, programming and broadcasting resources than we do. The markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from, among other things, technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments. Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment, such as cable television, wireless cable, satellite-to-home distribution services, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems and Internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to increased competition. We may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions. We are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future, the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business.
 
 
The FCC could implement regulations or Congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole.  
 
The FCC has initiated proceedings to determine whether to make TV joint sales agreements and shared services agreements attributable interests under its ownership rules; to determine whether it should establish more detailed criteria and additional recordkeeping and reporting obligations with respect to broadcasters’ requirements to serve the local public interest; to determine whether to require TV stations to maintain their public inspection files online (with additional information disclosed); and to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules, including the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the newspaper-television cross-ownership rule. Changes to any of these rules may have significant impact on us and the stations to which we provide services.
 
In addition, the FCC has sought comment on whether there are alternatives to the use of DMAs to define local markets such that certain viewers whose current DMAs straddle multiple states would be provided with more in-state broadcast programming. If the FCC determines to modify the use of existing DMAs to determine a station’s local market, such change might materially alter current station operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The FCC also may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties, any of which might have such an impact. Congress also may act to amend the Communications Act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general.  
 
The FCC may reallocate some portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use which alteration could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming.
 
The FCC has initiated various proceedings to assess the availability of spectrum to meet future wireless broadband needs. The FCC’s March 2010 “National Broadband Plan” recommends the reallocation of 120 megahertz of the spectrum currently used for broadcast television for wireless broadband use. The FCC has thus far requested comment on proposals that include, among other things, whether to add new frequency allocations in the television bands for licensed fixed and mobile wireless uses, whether to permit two television stations to share a single 6 megahertz channel and whether to implement technical rule modifications to improve the viability of certain channels that are underutilized by digital television stations. In February 2012, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the FCC to conduct incentive auctions whereby spectrum holders, including television broadcasters, could voluntarily relinquish all or part of their spectrum in exchange for consideration. A reallocation of television spectrum for wireless broadband use would likely involve a “repacking” of the television broadcast band, which would require some television stations to change channel or otherwise modify their technical facilities. Future steps to reallocate television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. We cannot predict the timing or results of television spectrum reallocation efforts or their impact to our business.

Item 7.                      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As a result of our deemed controlling financial interest in Mission, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Mission as if it were a wholly-owned entity. We believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our financial performance. Refer to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our determination that we are required to consolidate Mission’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows under the authoritative guidance for variable interest entities. Therefore, the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations includes Mission’s financial position and results of operations.
 
Executive Summary
 




    2011 Highlights









  


•


Net revenue decreased 2.2% during 2011 compared to 2010. Political advertising decreased by $33.0 million, which was partially offset by the acquisitions of WFRV, WJMN and WEHT along with increases in eMedia advertising revenue and retransmission compensation.



 




  


•


On July 1, 2011, we acquired the assets of WFRV and WJMN, the CBS affiliates serving the Green Bay, Wisconsin and Marquette, Michigan markets, respectively, from an affiliate of Liberty Media Corporation for $19.1 million in cash and the issuance of 334,292 shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $2.4 million. The cash consideration was funded by borrowing from the revolver under our senior secured credit facility.



 




  


•


On December 1, 2011, we acquired the assets of WEHT, the ABC affiliate serving the Evansville, Indiana market, from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation for $20.3 million in cash, funded with cash on hand and borrowings from our senior secured credit agreement. In addition, on December 1, 2011, Nexstar sold the FCC licenses, broadcast rights and related liabilities and certain equipment of WTVW to Mission for $6.7 million in cash and entered into local service agreements with Mission for WTVW, similar to Nexstar’s existing local service arrangements with Mission.



 




  


•


We and Mission renewed our affiliation agreements with ABC through June 2017 for all nine of the Company’s ABC stations. Additionally, Mission signed an agreement with ABC for affiliation of its station in Terre Haute, Indiana. The Terre Haute station, previously the FOX affiliate WFXW, launched with ABC on September 1, 2011 as WAWV.



 




  


•


On July 1, 2011, WTVW, the Evansville, Indiana station, launched LOCAL 7, an independent station. WTVW’s FOX affiliation agreement terminated on June 30, 2011. On August 1, 2011, WFFT, our Ft. Wayne, Indiana owned and operated station, launched WFFT LOCAL, an independent station. WFFT’s FOX affiliation agreement terminated on July 31, 2011. On September 1, 2011, KSFX, our Springfield, Missouri owned and operated station, launched OZARKS LOCAL, an independent station, with the call letters KOZL. KSFX’s FOX affiliation agreement terminated on August 31, 2011. We and Mission renewed our affiliation agreements with FOX through December 2013 for all 9 of the Company’s remaining FOX affiliate stations.



 




  


•


On September 26, 2011, we launched 10 new digital multicasts as affiliates of Bounce TV network, the first broadcast television network targeting African-American audiences.



 




  


•


In June 2011, our Board of Directors retained Moelis & Company as its financial advisor to assist with the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives intended to maximize stockholder value, including a possible sale of Nexstar. We have not made a decision to pursue any specific strategic transaction or other strategic alternative and there is no set timetable for the process, so there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a sale of Nexstar or any other transaction.

•


On January 3, 2012, Four Points sold their stations to Sinclair Broadcast Group. We served Four Points’ seven stations in four markets through a management services agreement, which comprised our management fee revenue. The management services agreement terminated upon the closing of the sale. On January 3, 2012, we received a payment of $6.7 million which included our management incentive fee earned for the year ended December 31, 2011 and a contract termination fee of $1.9 million, which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012.



 




  


•


In April 2011, we amended our senior secured credit facility, adding $50 million to our term loan, which was used to repurchase various outstanding notes, as discussed below.



 




  


•


During 2011, we and Mission made various borrowings of our revolving loans in our senior secured credit facilities, primarily related to acquisitions. During 2011, we also made payments on such revolving loans, funded through operating cash flow. The Company’s net borrowing of revolving loans for the year was $24.3 million.



 




  


•


During 2011, we redeemed and repurchased the $45.9 million remaining balance of our 11.375% senior discount notes due 2013 (“11.375% Notes”) at prices from 100% to 102%, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million.



 




  


•


During 2011, we repurchased $24.2 million of our outstanding 7% senior subordinated PIK notes due 2014 (“7% PIK Notes”) at prices from 97.75% to 100.5%, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million.



 




  


•


During 2011, we repurchased $7.5 million of our outstanding 7% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (“7% Notes”) at prices from 98.25% to 100.5%, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million.



 
 
Overview of Operations
 
We owned and operated 36 television stations as of December 31, 2011. Through various local service agreements, we programmed or provided sales and other services to 19 additional television stations and four digital multicast channels, including 17 television stations and four digital multicast channels owned and operated by Mission as of December 31, 2011. All of the stations that we program or provide sales and other services to, including Mission, are 100% owned by independent third parties.
 
The following table summarizes the various local service agreements we had in effect as of December 31, 2011 with Mission:
 





Service Agreements




Mission Stations




TBA Only(1)


WFXP and KHMT

(1)


We have a time brokerage agreement (“TBA”) with each of these stations which allows us to program most of each station’s broadcast time, sell each station’s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to Mission.







(2)


We have both a shared services agreement (“SSA”) and a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) with each of these stations. Each SSA allows the our station in the market to provide services including news production, technical maintenance and security, in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from Mission as described in the SSAs. Each JSA permits us to sell the station’s advertising time and retain a percentage of the station’s net advertising revenue, as described in the JSAs.



 
Our ability to receive cash from Mission is governed by these local service agreements. Under the local service agreements, we have received substantially all of Mission’s available cash, after satisfaction of its operating costs and debt obligations. We anticipate we will continue to receive substantially all of Mission’s available cash, after satisfaction of its operating costs and debt obligations.
 
We also guarantee all obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility. Similarly, Mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes. In consideration of our guarantee of Mission’s senior secured credit facility, Mission has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent, for an amount equal to the greater of (1) seven times the station’s cash flow, as defined in the option agreement, less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement, or (2) the amount of its indebtedness. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2012 and 2021 and are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by Mission. We expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration.



  


33





  



We do not own Mission or its television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have a controlling financial interest in Mission because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the Mission stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting Mission’s economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. In compliance with FCC regulations for both us and Mission, Mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for its stations.
 
The operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from broadcast and website advertising revenue, which is affected by a number of factors, including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate, the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market. Most advertising contracts are short-term and generally run for a few weeks. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, revenue generated from local broadcast advertising represented 73.4% and 73.7%, respectively, of our consolidated spot revenue (total of local and national broadcast advertising revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). The remaining broadcast advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising. All national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies. The agencies receive a commission rate of 15.0% of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them. While the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies, some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations’ local sales staff, thereby eliminating the agency commission. Each station also has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for sales representation outside the particular station’s market. Advertising schedules received through the national representative firm are for national or large regional accounts that advertise in several markets simultaneously. National commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station’s agreement.
 
Most of our stations have a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the stations during specified time periods, including prime time. NBC and CBS compensate some of the stations for distributing the network’s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods. The affiliation agreements with ABC, FOX, MyNetworkTV, The CW and Bounce TV do not provide for compensation. In recent years, in conjunction with the renewal of affiliation agreements with NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX, network compensation is being eliminated and many of the networks are now seeking cash payments from their affiliates.
 
Each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non-news and non-network time periods. The licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and/or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license. The latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights. The station records the estimated fair market value of the licenses, including any advertising inventory given to the program distributor, as a broadcast right asset and liability. Barter broadcast rights are recorded at management’s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged using historical advertising rates, which approximates the fair value of the program material received. The assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the license period or period of usage, whichever ends earlier. The cash broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments while the barter liability is amortized over the same amortization period as the asset as barter revenue.
 
Our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue, employee compensation and benefits, newsgathering and programming costs. A large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remains relatively fixed.
 
Seasonality
 
Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. The Company’s stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years, when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the Olympic Games. As 2011 was not an election year, we are reporting significantly less political advertising revenue in 2011 compared to 2010, which is consistent with our expectations.

Debt Transactions


On April 15, 2011, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment expanded our Term Loan B by $50.0 million to $149.5 million, allowed the proceeds of the credit facility to be used to refinance our existing notes and retained our incremental term loan capacity of $100.0 million. The net proceeds of the additional Term Loan B funding were used to redeem the remaining balance of the 11.375% Notes, for additional repurchases of outstanding notes and for general corporate purposes. The additional $50.0 million Term Loan B was funded on May 15, 2011.


On July 29, 2011, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Mission entered into the Third Amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendments, among other things, removed as an event of default the termination of more than three stations’ network affiliation agreements with major networks and lowered the maximum consolidated Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission total leverage ratio to 7.50 to 1.00 through December 30, 2012 and 6.50 to 1.00 thereafter.


On July 1, 2011, we borrowed $19.3 million of our revolving loan in our senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of the assets of WFRV and WJMN. On December 1, 2011, we borrowed $13.3 million of our revolving loan in our senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of the assets of WEHT and Mission borrowed $6.7 million of its revolving loan in its senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of the FCC license, broadcast rights and related liabilities, and certain equipment of WTVW from Nexstar. Throughout 2011, Nexstar made various net repayments on its revolving loans, resulting in a consolidated revolving loan balance of $24.3 million as of December 31, 2011.


On January 15, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed, on a pro rata basis, $12.5 million of its 11.375% Notes. Nexstar Holdings also repurchased $0.2 million outstanding 11.375% Notes in January 2011. Both transactions were priced at approximately 102%. On May 16, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed the remaining $33.2 million balance of its 11.375% Notes at the redemption price of 100.0%. These transactions resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million.


In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $24.2 million of its outstanding 7% PIK Notes at prices from 97.75% to 100.5%. These repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million.


In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $7.5 million of its outstanding 7% Notes at prices from 98.25% to 100.5%. These repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million.


Throughout 2011, we and Mission each paid the contractual maturities under our senior secured credit facilities, for a total payment of $1.4 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010
 
Revenue
 
Gross local advertising revenue was $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $173.9 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $7.7 million, or 4.4%, of which $5.1 million related to acquired stations. Gross national advertising revenue was $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $62.0 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $3.7 million, or 6.0%, of which $2.2 million related to acquired stations. Excluding acquisitions, gross local and national advertising revenue increased by $4.1 million. The increase primarily related to increases in advertising from automotive of $3.3 million, department and retail stores of $1.6 million, school and instruction of $0.9 million and insurance of $0.8 million for the year, which was offset by a decrease in advertising from media (radio, television, cable and newspapers) of $0.8 million, telecom of $0.8 million and grocery stores of $0.8 million for the year. The increase in automotive was primarily driven by increases in domestic manufacturers and dealers, particularly Ford and GM, and was partially offset by decreases in foreign manufacturers, most notably Toyota. The increase in department and retail stores was primarily driven by increases in local retailers as well as BonTon, Walmart and Shoe Carnival. The increase in school and instruction advertising was primarily driven by increases in vocational schools, both from existing and new customers.
 
Gross political advertising revenue was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $39.3 million for the same period in 2010, a decrease of $33.0 million, or 83.9%, as expected since 2011 is not an election year. The current year political revenue primarily related to a special congressional election in Rochester, New York, Wisconsin gubernatorial and state senate recalls and issue and political action spending.
 
Retransmission compensation was $37.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $29.9 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $7.5 million, or 25.0%. The increase in retransmission compensation was primarily the result of renegotiated contracts providing for higher rates per subscriber during the year, which is consistent with industry-wide trends, and additional revenue from WFRV, WJMN and WEHT of $1.0 million.
 
eMedia revenue, representing web-based advertising revenue generated at our stations, was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $2.4 million or 17.4%. The increase in eMedia revenue is attributable to the introduction of new service offerings and increased penetration of our customer base through eMedia sales efforts.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Corporate expenses, related to costs associated with the centralized management of Nexstar’s and Mission’s stations, remained consistent at $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Corporate expenses decreased due to the 2010 recognition of $1.6 million of non-cash incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the stock option repricing in May 2010 (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which was offset by an increase of $1.4 million in legal and professional fees associated primarily with our acquisitions, strategic alternatives and our antitrust lawsuit.
 
Station direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of news, engineering and programming, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $159.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $151.7 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $7.5 million, or 5.0%. The increase in station expenses was primarily attributed to $5.3 million in station expenses of newly acquired WFRV, WJMN and WEHT and an increase of $1.7 million in employee health care costs, principally due to some large claims during the year.
 
Amortization of broadcast rights, excluding barter, was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.4%. The increase was primarily due to the station acquisitions of $1.3 million, which was partially offset by a decrease due to the termination of syndication of The Oprah Winfrey Show.
 
Amortization of intangible assets was $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $23.7 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $2.2 million or 9.5%. The increase was due to incremental amortization on our FOX affiliate stations with agreements terminating in 2011, as well as the amortization of newly acquired intangibles.
 
Depreciation of property and equipment was $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $21.1 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $0.7 million, or 3.5%.

Interest Expense, net
 
Interest expense, net, was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $54.3 million for the same period in 2010, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 2.3%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to the buyback of notes with higher interest rates, financed with our senior secured credit facility, as well as an overall reduction in debt.
 
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
 
In 2011, the Company recognized $1.2 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, including $0.7 million related to the repurchases of the 11.375% Notes, $0.2 million related to the repurchases of the 7% Notes and $0.3 million related to the repurchases of the 7% PIK Notes.


 
Income Taxes
 
Income tax expense was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million. Our provision for income taxes is primarily created by an increase in the deferred tax liability position during the year arising from the amortizing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes.


Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009
 
Revenue
 
Gross local advertising revenue was $173.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $157.4 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $16.5 million, or 10.5%. Gross national advertising revenue was $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $55.1 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $6.9 million, or 12.6%. The combined increase in gross local and national advertising revenue of $23.4 million was largely the result of an $11.3 million increase in automotive related advertising, our largest advertising category. Also contributing to the overall increase in local and national advertising were increases in the following advertising categories:  $5.6 million in services, $3.3 million in department stores and retail, $1.3 million in education, $1.3 million in telecom and $1.2 million in entertainment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the paid programming category of $1.7 million.
 
Gross political advertising revenue was $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $33.4 million, or more than five times. The increase in gross political revenue was attributed to state and local races (primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Texas and Arkansas) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to nominal political advertising during the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Retransmission compensation was $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $24.3 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $5.7 million, or 23.3%. The increase in retransmission compensation was primarily the result of renegotiated contracts providing for higher rates per subscriber during the year and the addition of WCWJ in May 2009.
 
eMedia revenue, representing web-based advertising revenue generated at our stations, was $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $11.7 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $2.1 million or 18.3%. The increase in eMedia revenue was a result of an overall upswing in the economy and enhanced sales efforts for the eMedia product.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Corporate expenses, related to costs associated with the centralized management of Nexstar’s and Mission’s stations, were $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $1.3 million, or 7.2%. The increase was primarily attributed to the recognition of $1.6 million of non-cash incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the stock option repricing in May 2010 (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details related to the stock option repricing), $4.3 million in bonus payments and $0.4 million for the reinstatement of our 401(k) match, partially offset by the elimination of 2009 costs of $2.9 million in professional fees associated with the 7% PIK Notes exchange offer in March 2009.

Station direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of news, engineering and programming, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $151.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $141.5 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $10.2 million, or 7.2%. The increase in station expenses was primarily attributed to an increase of $3.3 million in national and local sales commissions related to increased revenues, as well as increases of $3.1 million in amounts paid under station outsourcing agreements, $1.6 million in bad debt expense, $0.7 million in programming costs, $0.4 million in property taxes and $0.3 million in lease buyouts.
 
Amortization of broadcast rights, excluding barter, was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $13.2 million for the same period in 2009, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 28.1%. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of $2.4 million of 2009 write-downs.
 
Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent at $23.7 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, due to the consistent balance of amortizable intangible assets during 2010 and 2009.
 
Depreciation of property and equipment was $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $21.7 million for the same period in 2009, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 2.6%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a non-cash gain of $8.1 million from the exchange of equipment for the digital conversion under an arrangement with Sprint Nextel Corporation. This program concluded in early 2010, resulting in an insignificant gain in 2010.


Interest Expense, net
 
Interest expense, net was $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $39.2 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $15.0 million, or 38.3%. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributed to the higher interest rate of the $325.0 million 8.875% senior secured second lien notes due 2017 (“8.875% Notes”) compared to the senior secured credit facilities.
 
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
 
In 2010, the Company recognized $8.4 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, including $6.0 million related to the amendments of Nexstar’s and Mission’s senior secured credit facilities, $2.6 million related to the repurchases and complete retirement of the senior subordinated PIK notes due 2014 and $0.2 million related to the repurchases of the 11.375% Notes, offset by gains of $0.4 million related to the repurchases of the 7% Notes and 7% PIK Notes.
 
Income Taxes
 
Income tax expense was $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $6.5 million. Our provision for income taxes is primarily created by an increase in the deferred tax liability position during the year arising from the amortizing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes. In 2009, an impairment charge of $16.2 million on indefinite-lived intangible assets reduced the book value and therefore decreased the deferred tax liability position. No tax benefit was recorded with respect to the taxable losses for 2010 and 2009, as the utilization of such losses is not more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We and Mission are highly leveraged, which makes the Company vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions. Our and Mission’s ability to meet the future cash requirements described below depends on our and Mission’s ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our and Mission’s control. Based on current operations and anticipated future growth, we believe that our and Mission’s available cash, anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the Nexstar and Mission senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital expenditure requirements, interest payments and scheduled debt principal payments for at least the next twelve months. In order to meet future cash needs we may, from time to time, borrow under our existing senior secured credit facilities or issue other long- or short-term debt or equity, if the market and the terms of our existing debt arrangements permit, and Mission may, from time to time, borrow under its existing senior secured credit facility. We will continue to evaluate the best use of Nexstar’s operating cash flow among its capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt reduction.

Cash Flows—Operating Activities


Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $18.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to our overall decrease in net broadcast revenue, excluding the impact of the decrease in deferred revenue, of $5.2 million, a decrease of $4.7 million resulting from the timing of collections of accounts receivable, an increase of $4.2 million in cash paid for interest and an increase in station expenses of $7.5 million, which was partially offset by the timing of payments to our vendors of $2.0 million. The increase in cash paid for interest was primarily due to the conversion of the 7% PIK Notes to cash interest payments during 2011, with a payment of $3.9 million during the year.


Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $36.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily due to our overall increase in net broadcast revenue, excluding the impact of the decrease in deferred revenue, of $55.8 million, an increase of $7.0 million resulting from the timing of collections of accounts receivable and an increase of $2.1 million resulting from the timing of payments to vendors, partially offset by an increase in station selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.0 million and an increase in cash paid for interest of $17.7 million. The increase in cash paid for interest was due to $11.7 million of accrued PIK interest, original issue discounts and call premiums on the debt repurchases during the year, as well as increased interest rates and a change in the timing of interest payments arising from the refinancing of debt with the 8.875% Notes.

Nexstar and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Mission files its own separate federal income tax return. Additionally, Nexstar and Mission file their own state and local tax returns as required. Due to our and Mission’s recent history of net operating losses, we and Mission currently do not pay any federal income taxes. These net operating losses may be carried forward, subject to expiration and certain limitations, and used to reduce taxable earnings in future years. Through the use of available loss carryforwards, it is possible that we and Mission may not pay significant amounts of federal income taxes in the foreseeable future.


Cash Flows—Investing Activities


Net cash used in investing activities increased by $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Capital expenditures were fairly consistent at $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Additionally, we paid an aggregate of $41.4 million for the acquisitions of WFRV, WJMN, GoLocal.Biz and WEHT. There were no acquisitions in 2010.


Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $22.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Capital expenditures were $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of the digital conversions in 2009 and early 2010.


Cash Flows—Financing Activities
 
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $33.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a decrease in net debt payments during the year, due to our acquisition activity.
 
During 2011, Nexstar added $50.0 million to its term loan, used to repurchase various outstanding notes, and borrowed $40.4 million of revolving loans, primarily related to the acquisitions, both under the Nexstar senior secured credit agreement. Nexstar repaid $22.8 million throughout the year of the revolving loans, using cash on hand. The outstanding balance of the 11.375% Notes of $45.9 million, $7.3 million of outstanding 7% Notes and $21.2 million of outstanding 7% PIK Notes were repurchased during the year, from the proceeds of the term loan borrowing and cash on hand, all amounts net of amounts paid related to accrued PIK interest and original issue discount. Mission borrowed $6.7 million of revolving loans under the Mission senior secured credit facility, related to the acquisition of WTVW.
 
Net cash from financing activities decreased by $44.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in debt payments during the year, partially offset by the net proceeds of the issuance of the 8.875% Notes.
 
During 2010, Nexstar and Mission paid a total of $299.2 million on Nexstar’s and Mission’s senior secured credit facilities. The outstanding balance of the senior subordinated PIK notes due 2014 was repurchased in various transactions throughout the year for $35.0 million, excluding amounts related to accrued PIK interest and original issue discount. Additionally, throughout 2010, Nexstar completed repurchases of $5.9 million of the 7% PIK Notes, $2.4 million of the 7% Notes and $2.3 million of the 11.375% Notes, all net of amounts related to accrued PIK interest and original issue discount.


Although our senior secured credit facility limits, but does not prohibit, the payment of cash dividends to common stockholders, we do not currently intend to declare or pay a cash dividend.

Future Sources of Financing and Debt Service Requirements
 
As of December 31, 2011, Nexstar and Mission had total combined debt of $640.4 million, which represented 140.1% of Nexstar and Mission’s combined capitalization. Our and Mission’s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
 
The following table summarizes the aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature in the following years as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

We make semi-annual interest payments on our 8.875% Notes in April and October and on both our 7% Notes and our 7% PIK notes in January and July. Interest payments on our and Mission’s senior credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months, based on the type of interest rate selected.
 
The terms of the Nexstar and Mission senior credit facilities, as well as of the indentures governing our publicly-held notes, limit, but do not prohibit us or Mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future.
 
We do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. However, a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new, credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities.
 
Debt Covenants


Our senior secured credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios, including: (a) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, (b) a maximum consolidated first lien indebtedness ratio, and (c) a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission. Mission’s senior secured credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however it does include an event of default if Nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement. The 7% Notes, the 7% PIK Notes and the 8.875% Notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type. We believe we will be able to maintain compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes for a period of at least the next twelve months from December 31, 2011.
 
No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. All of our arrangements with Mission are on-balance sheet arrangements. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $3.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Company has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The resolution of these tax positions may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards.


 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to goodwill and intangible assets, bad debts, broadcast rights, retransmission revenue, trade and barter and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
 
For an overview of our significant accounting policies, we refer you to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, affect our more significant estimates and assumptions, and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management.
 
Consolidation of Mission and Variable Interest Entities
 
We regularly evaluate our contractual arrangements with our local service agreements and other arrangements where we may have variable interests to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Under U.S. GAAP, a company must consolidate an entity when it has a “controlling financial interest” resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity’s voting rights. Accounting rules expand the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights.
 
In applying accounting and disclosure requirements, we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity’s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entity’s economic rewards. Our evaluation of the “risks and rewards” model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change.



  


43





  



 
Mission is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in Mission as a VIE for financial reporting purposes as a result of (1) local service agreements we have with the Mission stations, (2) our guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, (3) our power over significant activities affecting Mission’s economic performance, including budgeting for Mission’s advertising revenue, advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options expire on various dates between 2012 and 2021 and we expect them to be renewed upon expiration.
 
Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets represented $335.6 million, or 56.4%, of our total assets as of December 31, 2011. Intangible assets principally include FCC licenses, goodwill and network affiliation agreements. If the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value, we may be required to record an impairment charge.
 
We test the impairment of our FCC licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of FCC licenses with their carrying amount on a market-by-market basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method, assuming a hypothetical startup scenario.
 
We test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the market (“reporting unit”) to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view, manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the reporting unit and the prevailing values in the markets for broadcasters. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation, using the reporting unit’s fair value (as determined in the first step described above) as the purchase price. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill.
 
We test network affiliation agreements whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the operations to which the asset relates is less than its carrying value.
 
We completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and FCC licenses tested for impairment as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, resulting in no need for impairment charges. All of the fair values of our reporting units and FCC licenses tested for impairment exceeded their book values by a margin of at least 10%.
 
The assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions.
 
We utilized the following assumptions in our impairment testing for the years ended December 31:
 



 
    2011   
    2010

0 – 5.9%


(0.2) – 5.5%

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.3 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Broadcast Rights Carrying Amount
 
Broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Cash broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors’ programming. Barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged, which approximates the fair value of the programming received. The fair value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical rates for specific time periods. Amortization of broadcast rights is computed using the straight-line method based on the license period or programming usage, whichever period yields the shorter life. The current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year. When projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights, for example, due to poor ratings, we write-down the unamortized cost of the broadcast rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenue. If the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled we would be required to write-off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amounts of our current broadcast rights were $16.3 million and non-current broadcast rights were $9.4 million.
 
Retransmission Revenue
 
We earn revenues from local cable providers, satellite services and MVPDs for the retransmission of our broadcasts. These revenues are generally earned based on a price per subscriber of the MVPD within the retransmission area. The MVPDs report their subscriber numbers to us periodically, generally upon payment of the fees due to us. Prior to receiving the MVPD reporting, we record revenue based on management’s estimate of the number of subscribers, utilizing historical levels and trends of subscribers for each MVPD.


 
Trade and Barter Transactions
 
We trade certain advertising time for various goods and services. These transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received. We barter advertising time for certain program material. These transactions, except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming, are recorded at management’s estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged, which approximates the fair value of the program material received. The fair value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods. We recorded barter revenue of $13.5 million, $12.0 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Trade revenue of $8.0 million, $7.7 million and $7.4 million was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We incurred trade and barter expense of $21.3 million, $19.6 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.


Income Taxes
 
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made.
 
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income taxes as components of income tax expense.



  


45





  



Stock Option Expense Recognition
 
We recognize the expense related to our stock options based on their grant date fair value over the period that the employee is required to provide services, to the extent the awards vest. We apply an estimated forfeiture rate assumption to adjust compensation cost for the effect of those employees that are not expected to complete the requisite service period and will forfeit unvested options. We base the forfeiture rate assumption on our historical experience of award forfeitures, adjusted for certain events that are not expected to recur during the vesting period of our outstanding options.
 
We determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our valuation of employee stock options relies on our estimates of our expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the option award. These assumptions are highly subjective and involve an estimate of future uncertain events. We utilize our historical stock price volatility to determine the expected volatility. We use our exercise and forfeiture history to determine the expected term.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including our expected date of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position.


Item 7A.                         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations.
 
The interest rate on the term loan borrowings under the senior credit facilities was 5.0% as of December 31, 2011 and the interest rate on the revolver loans was 4.3%, which represented the base rate, or LIBOR, plus the applicable margin, as defined. Interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements.
 
Including the impact of the LIBOR floor on our term loans, an increase in LIBOR of 100 basis points (one percentage point) or 50 basis points (one-half of a percentage point) from its December 31, 2011 level would increase our annual interest expense and decrease our cash flow from operations by $1.1 million or $0.2 million, respectively, based on the outstanding balance of our credit facilities as of December 31, 2011. Conversely, a decrease in LIBOR by 100 or 50 basis points would decrease our annual interest expense and increase our cash flow from operations by $0.1 million. Our 8.875% Notes, our 7% Notes and our 7% PIK Notes are fixed rate debt obligations and therefore are not exposed to market interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2011, we have no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on our senior credit facilities.
 
Impact of Inflation
 
We believe that our results of operations are not affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate.

Item 9A.                      Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Nexstar’s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer along with its Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Nexstar’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
 
Based upon that evaluation, Nexstar’s President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2011, Nexstar’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Nexstar’s management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
During the quarterly period as of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in Nexstar’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Nexstar’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based upon the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.


We have excluded WFRV, WJMN, GoLocal.Biz and WEHT from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, because they were acquired in purchase business combinations in 2011. These acquired businesses represented collectively 1.8% of our consolidated total assets and 3.0% of our consolidated total net revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.


Based on management’s assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc:


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was an integrated audit in 2011). We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


As described in  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded WFRV, WJMN, GoLocal.Biz and WEHT from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2011. We have also excluded WFRV, WJMN, GoLocal.Biz and WEHT from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. WFRV, WJMN, GoLocal.Biz and WEHT are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent collectively 1.8% and 3.0% respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.

NEXSTAR BROADCASTING GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. Organization and Business Operations
 
As of December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. (“Nexstar”) owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 55 television stations and 11 digital multi-cast channels, including those owned by Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (“Mission”), in 32 markets in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, New York, Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan. The stations are affiliates of NBC (12 stations), CBS (11 stations), ABC (11 stations), FOX (11 stations), MyNetworkTV (5 stations and one digital multi-cast channel), The CW (2 stations), and Bounce TV (10 digital multi-cast channels) and three are independent. The stations reach approximately 10.6 million viewers or 9.3% of all U.S. television households. Through various local service agreements, Nexstar provided sales, programming and other services to 19 stations and four digital multi-cast channels owned and/or operated by independent third parties. Nexstar operates in one reportable television broadcasting segment. The economic characteristics, services, production process, customer type and distribution methods for Nexstar’s operations are substantially similar and are therefore aggregated as a single reportable segment.


In June 2011, Nexstar’s Board of Directors retained Moelis & Company as its financial advisor to assist with the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives intended to maximize stockholder value, including a possible sale of the Company. The Company has not made a decision to pursue any specific strategic transaction or other strategic alternative and there is no set timetable for the process, so there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a sale of the Company or any other transaction.


2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Principles of Consolidation


The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Nexstar and its subsidiaries. Also included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are the accounts of the independently-owned variable interest entity (“VIE”), Mission (Nexstar and Mission are collectively referred to as the “Company”). Where the assets of Mission are not available to be used to settle the obligations of Nexstar, they are presented as the assets of Mission on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Conversely, where the creditors of Mission do not have recourse to the general credit of Nexstar, the related liabilities are presented as the liabilities of Mission on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nexstar management evaluates each arrangement that may include variable interests and determines the need to consolidate an entity where it determines Nexstar is the primary beneficiary of a VIE in accordance with related authoritative literature and interpretive guidance.


All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


Liquidity
 
Nexstar is highly leveraged, which makes it vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions. Nexstar’s ability to repay or refinance its debt will depend on, among other things, financial, business, market, competitive and other conditions, many of which are beyond Nexstar’s control.


During 2011, Nexstar Finance Holdings, Inc. (“Nexstar Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nexstar, redeemed the balance of its 11.375% senior discount notes due 2013 (“11.375% Notes”) by a redemption of $12.5 million in January 2011, a repurchase of $0.2 million in January 2011 and a redemption of the remaining balance of $33.2 million in May 2011. Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. (“Nexstar Broadcasting”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Nexstar, repurchased additional outstanding notes during 2011, including $7.5 million of 7% senior subordinated notes due 2014 (“7% Notes”) and $24.2 million of 7% senior subordinated PIK notes due 2014 (“7% PIK Notes”).


Additionally, in April 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facility. The amendment provided $50.0 million additional funding, which was used for the May redemption of the 11.375% Notes, repurchases of additional outstanding notes and general corporate purposes. See Note 8 for more details related to this amendment. Additionally, throughout 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting borrowed a net $17.6 million from its revolving loan in its senior secured credit facility in connection with acquisitions (See Note 3) and Mission borrowed $6.7 million in connection with its acquisition of WTVW (See Note 3). Thoughout 2011, the Company repaid scheduled maturities on its senior secured credit facilities. See Note 8 for more details related to these debt transactions.

Mission
 
Mission is included in these Consolidated Financial Statements because Nexstar is deemed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") to have a controlling financial interest in Mission as a VIE for financial reporting purposes as a result of (1) local service agreements Nexstar has with the Mission stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility (see Note 8), (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting Mission’s economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) consent. The purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission for consideration equal to the greater of (1) seven times the station’s cash flow, as defined in the option agreement, less the amount of its indebtedness, as defined in the option agreement, or (2) the amount of its indebtedness. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2012 and 2021. The Company expects these option agreements, if unexercised, will be renewed upon expiration. Substantially all of Mission’s assets, except for its FCC licenses, collateralize its secured debt obligation. See Note 17 for a presentation of condensed consolidating financial information of the Company, which includes the accounts of Mission.
 
Nexstar has entered into local service agreements with Mission to provide sales and/or operating services to the Mission stations. The following table summarizes the various local service agreements Nexstar had in effect with Mission as of December 31, 2011:
 





Service Agreements




Mission Stations




TBA Only(1)


WFXP and KHMT



SSA & JSA(2)


KJTL, KJBO-LP, KOLR, KCIT, KCPN-LP, KAMC, KRBC, KSAN, WUTR, WAWV, WYOU, KODE, WTVO, KTVE and WTVW




              





(1)


Nexstar has a time brokerage agreement (“TBA”) with each of these stations which allows Nexstar to program most of each station’s broadcast time, sell each station’s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to Mission, based on the station’s monthly operating expenses.







(2)


Nexstar has both a shared services agreement (“SSA”) and a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) with each of these stations. Each SSA allows the Nexstar station in the market to provide services including news production, technical maintenance and security, in exchange for Nexstar’s right to receive certain payments from Mission as described in the SSAs. Each JSA permits Nexstar to sell the station’s advertising time and retain a percentage of the net revenue from the station’s advertising time in return for monthly payments to Mission of the remaining percentage of net revenue, as described in the JSAs.





Nexstar’s ability to receive cash from Mission is governed by these local service agreements. Under the local service agreements, Nexstar has received substantially all of Mission’s available cash, after satisfaction of operating costs and debt obligations. Nexstar anticipates it will continue to receive substantially all of Mission’s available cash, after satisfaction of operating costs and debt obligations. In compliance with FCC regulations for both Nexstar and Mission, Mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of its stations.


Variable Interest Entities


The Company may determine that a station is a VIE as a result of local service agreements entered into with the owner-operator of the station. The term local service agreements generally refers to a contract between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner-operator of one station contracts with the owner-operator of the other station to provide it with administrative, sales and other services required for the operation of its station. Nevertheless, the owner-operator of each station retains control and responsibility for the operation of its station, including ultimate responsibility over all programming broadcast on its station. In addition to those with Mission, Nexstar has VIEs in connection with local service agreements entered into with stations as discussed below.


In 2001, Nexstar entered into an outsourcing agreement with a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (“Sinclair”), the owner of WYZZ, the FOX affiliate in Peoria, Illinois. In 2005, Nexstar entered into an outsourcing agreement with a subsidiary of Sinclair, the owner of WUHF, the FOX affiliate in Rochester, New York. Under the outsourcing agreements, Nexstar provides certain engineering, production, sales and administrative services for WYZZ and WUHF through WMBD and WROC, the Nexstar television stations in the respective markets. During the term of the outsourcing agreements, Nexstar is obligated to pay Sinclair a monthly fee based on the combined operating cash flow of WMBD and WYZZ and of WROC and WUHF, as defined in the agreements, which both expire December 31, 2013.
 






 

  


F-8





  



 
In 2006, upon Nexstar’s acquisition of WLYH, the CW affiliate in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Nexstar became party to a TBA with Newport Television License, LLC (“Newport”). Under the TBA, Nexstar allows WHP, Newport’s CBS affiliate in Harrisburg, to program most of WLYH’s broadcast time, sell its advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to Nexstar. The TBA expires in 2015.


Nexstar has determined that it has variable interests in WYZZ, WUHF and WHP. Nexstar has evaluated its arrangements with Sinclair and Newport and has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interests because it does not have the ultimate power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the stations including developing the annual operating budget, programming and oversight and control of sales management personnel. Therefore, Nexstar has not consolidated these stations under authoritative guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. Under the outsourcing agreements with Sinclair, Nexstar pays for certain operating expenses of WYZZ and WUHF, and therefore may have unlimited exposure to any potential operating losses. Nexstar’s management believes that Nexstar’s minimum exposure to loss under the Sinclair outsourcing agreements consists of the fees paid to Sinclair. Additionally, Nexstar indemnifies the owners of WHP, WYZZ and WUHF from and against all liability and claims arising out of or resulting from its activities, acts or omissions in connection with the agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments Nexstar could be required to make for such indemnification is undeterminable at this time. As of December 31, 2011, Nexstar had a balance in accounts payable to Sinclair for fees under these arrangements of $0.7 million and receivables for advertising aired on these two stations of $2.7 million. Sinclair fees incurred under these arrangements of $5.6 million, $6.2 million and $3.1 million were included in direct operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Nexstar received payments from Newport under the TBA of $50 thousand, which were included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.


Nexstar has also determined that it has a variable interest in Four Points Media Group Holdings, LLC (“Four Points”) due to a management services agreement between the two companies. Four Points owns and operates seven individual stations in four markets. Under this agreement, Nexstar managed the stations for Four Points but did not have ultimate control over the policies or operations of the stations. Nexstar has evaluated the business arrangement with Four Points and concluded that Nexstar is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest because it does not have the ultimate power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the stations including developing the annual operating budget, setting advertising rates, programming and oversight and control of employees responsible for carrying out business activities of the stations. Therefore, Nexstar does not consolidate Four Points’ financial results into its own. As of December 31, 2011, Nexstar had a balance in accounts receivable for management fees from Four Points of $4.8 million, of which $4.2 million relates to incentive fees for meeting certain financial targets. As of December 31, 2011, Nexstar owed Four Points for retransmission revenue it collected on Four Points behalf of $0.2 million, which was recorded as an accrued expense. Nexstar must indemnify Four Points for any claim or liability that arises out of its acts or omissions related to the agreement. For this reason, the maximum exposure to loss as a result of this agreement with Four Points is not determinable. In September 2011, Four Points entered into a definitive agreement to sell their stations to Sinclair and Nexstar began transitioning duties to Sinclair. The sale closed on January 3, 2012, terminating the management services agreement, whereby Nexstar received a payment of $6.7 million, including the outstanding accounts receivable balance of $4.8 million and a contract termination fee of $1.9 million.


Basis of Presentation


Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, including the presentation of certain Mission assets and liabilities separately from the assets and liabilities of Nexstar, including the sale of WTVW to Mission, as discussed in Note 3. These reclassifications had no effect on net loss or stockholders' deficit as previously reported.


Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates made by management include those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts, retransmission revenue recognized, trade and barter transactions, income taxes, the recoverability of broadcast rights, the carrying amounts, recoverability and useful lives of intangible assets and the fair value of non-monetary asset exchanges. Actual results may vary from estimates used.






 

  


F-9





  



Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. 
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
The Company’s accounts receivable consists primarily of billings to its customers for advertising broadcast on its stations or placed on its websites or for retransmission consent from cable or satellite operators. Trade receivables normally have terms of 30 days and the Company has no interest provision for customer accounts that are past due. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Management evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors, including customer payment history, known customer circumstances, as well as the overall aging of customer balances and trends. In circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, an allowance is recorded to reduce their receivable amount to an amount estimated to be collected.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash deposits are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, the Company believes these deposits are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and are not subject to any unusual credit risk. A significant portion of the Company’s accounts receivable is due from local and national advertising agencies. The Company does not require collateral from its customers, but maintains reserves for potential credit losses. Management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, but if the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or by geographical area.


Revenue Recognition


The Company’s revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising. Total revenue includes cash and barter advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, retransmission compensation, network compensation and other broadcast related revenues:
 




  


•


Advertising revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period during which the commercial is broadcast on its stations or shown on its websites. Any amounts paid by customers but not earned by the balance sheet date are recorded in deferred revenue.



 




  


•


Retransmission compensation is recognized based on the estimated number of subscribers over the contract period, based on historical levels and trends for individual providers.



 




  


•


Other revenues, which include the production of client advertising, are recognized in the period during which the services are provided.



 




  


•


Network compensation is either recognized when the Company’s station broadcasts specific network programming based upon a negotiated hourly-rate, or on a straight-line basis based upon the total negotiated compensation to be received by the Company over the term of the agreement. Some of our network agreements included payments received at the beginning of the contract, which are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.



 
The Company barters advertising time for certain program material. These transactions, except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming, are recorded at management’s estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged, which approximates the fair value of the program material received. The fair value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods. Revenue from barter transactions is recognized as the related advertisement spots are broadcast. Barter expense is recognized at the time program broadcast rights assets are used. The Company recorded $13.5 million, $12.0 million and $12.0 million of barter revenue and barter expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Barter expense is included in amortization of broadcast rights in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.






 

  


F-10





  



The Company trades certain advertising time for various goods and services. These transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received. Revenue from trade transactions is recognized when the related advertisement spots are broadcast. The Company recorded $8.0 million, $7.7 million and $7.4 million of trade revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
Trade expense is recognized when services or merchandise received are used. The Company recorded $7.8 million, $7.6 million and $6.7 million of trade expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which was included in direct operating expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Broadcast Rights and Broadcast Rights Payable
 
The Company records rights to programs, primarily in the form of syndicated programs and feature movie packages obtained under license agreements for the limited right to broadcast the suppliers’ programming when the following criteria are met: (1) the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable, (2) the license period has begun, (3) the program material has been accepted in accordance with the license agreement, and (4) the programming is available for use. Broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program suppliers; or, in the case of barter transactions, at management’s estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged using historical advertising rates, which approximates the fair value of the program material received. Broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year. Amortization of broadcast rights is computed using the straight-line method based on the license period or programming usage, whichever period yields the shorter life. Broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments to program suppliers; or, in the case of barter transactions, are amortized over the life of the associated programming license contract as a component of trade and barter revenue. When projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights, for example, due to poor ratings, the Company records amortization of the broadcast rights such that they equal the amount of projected future net revenue. If the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled, the Company would be required to amortize the remaining value of the related broadcast rights on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately.


Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment is stated at cost or estimated fair value at the date of acquisition for trade transactions. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized and ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to expense in the period incurred. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 39 years (see Note 4).
 
Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair values of net assets acquired on the acquisition date, and broadcast licenses (“FCC licenses”) and network affiliation agreements, recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition using a discounted cash flow method. The Company’s goodwill and FCC licenses are considered to be indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. The use of an indefinite life for FCC licenses contemplates the Company’s historical ability to renew its licenses, that such renewals generally may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost and that the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future. Therefore, cash flows derived from the FCC licenses are expected to continue indefinitely. Network affiliation agreements are subject to amortization computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 15 years.
 


The Company aggregates its stations by market (“reporting unit”) for purposes of goodwill and FCC license impairment testing because management views, manages and evaluates its stations on a market basis. The impairment test for FCC licenses consists of a market-by-market comparison of the carrying amount of FCC licenses with their fair value, using a discounted cash flow analysis. The impairment test for goodwill utilizes a two-step fair value approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation, using the reporting unit fair value (as determined in Step 1) as the purchase price. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.




 

  


F-11





  



Determining the fair value of reporting units requires management to make a number of judgments about assumptions and estimates that are highly subjective and that are based on unobservable inputs. The actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates; and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the various inputs (i.e. market growth, operating profit margins, discount rates) used to calculate the fair value of FCC licenses and reporting units, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its assumptions by comparing the total fair value of all its reporting units to its total market capitalization; and by comparing the fair values of its reporting units and FCC licenses to recent market television station sale transactions.
 
The Company tests network affiliation agreements whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. An impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the operation to which the asset relates is less than its carrying value. The impairment test for network affiliation agreements consists of a station-by-station comparison of the carrying amount of network affiliation agreements with their fair value, using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Debt Financing Costs
 
Debt financing costs represent direct costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Previously capitalized debt financing costs are expensed and included in loss on extinguishment of debt if the Company determines that there has been a substantial modification of the related debt. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, debt financing costs of $5.0 million and $6.8 million, respectively, were included in other noncurrent assets.


Comprehensive Loss
 
Comprehensive loss includes net loss and certain items that are excluded from net loss and recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no items of other comprehensive income (loss) and, therefore, comprehensive loss does not differ from reported net loss.


Advertising Expense
 
The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs in the amount of $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which the majority was recognized in trade expense.


 
Financial Instruments
 
The Company utilizes the following categories to classify the valuation methodologies for fair values of financial assets and liabilities:
 
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
 
Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;
 
Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
 
The Company invests in short-term interest bearing obligations with original maturities less than 90 days, primarily money market funds. The Company does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $0.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, invested in money market investments, which are carried at fair value. The Company has determined the fair value of the money market investment using methods that fall within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, broadcast rights payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. See Note 8 for fair value disclosures related to the Company’s debt.




 

  


F-12





  



Stock-Based Compensation
 
Nexstar maintains stock-based employee compensation plans which are described more fully in Note 12. The Company calculates the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes model and recognizes this amount into selling, general and administrative expense over the vesting period of the options.


Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Nexstar and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Mission files its own separate federal income tax return.
 
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to income taxes within income tax expense.
 
Loss Per Share
 
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share excludes the impact of dilutive potential common shares outstanding arising from stock options outstanding during the period calculated using the treasury stock method, as any such potential common shares would be anti-dilutive to the income of a stockholder. Options were outstanding to purchase the following weighted-average shares of Nexstar’s Class A common stock for the years ended December 31:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements


In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605):  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (“ASU 2009-13”). ASU 2009-13 allows the use of companies’ estimated selling prices as the value for deliverable elements under certain circumstances and eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation of deliverable elements. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2011, and the adoption had no impact to the Company’s financial position or results of operations.


In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):  Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 clarifies certain topics regarding fair value measurement and adds some disclosures for fair value measurements. The update is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2012. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will have an impact on its financial position or results of operations.


In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (Topic 350) (“ASU 2011-08”). ASU 2011-08 allows companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the annual two-step goodwill impairment test. The update is effective for the Company’s goodwill impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, but early adoption is permitted, including for the Company’s 2011 testing. The Company does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The 2011 acquisitions are immaterial, both individually and in aggregate, therefore pro forma information has not been provided for these acquisitions.


In 2009, Nexstar acquired the following: WCWJ, The CW affiliate for the Jacksonville, Florida market and KARZ, the MyNetworkTV affiliate for the Little Rock-Pine Bluff, Arkansas market.


The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition.


WFRV and WJMN


On July 1, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting acquired the assets of WFRV and WJMN from an affiliate of Liberty Media Corporation for $21.5 million. This acquisition allows the Company entrance into these markets. The purchase consideration is comprised of $19.1 million of cash, borrowed under Nexstar Broadcasting’s senior secured credit facility, and the issuance of 334,292 unregistered shares of Nexstar Class A common stock, valued at $2.4 million. Transaction costs relating to this acquisition, including legal and professional fees and travel, of $0.1 million were expensed as incurred.

GoLocal.Biz


On July 14, 2011, Nexstar acquired the assets of Internet technology provider GoLocal.Biz for $1.0 million.

WEHT and WTVW


On December 1, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting acquired the assets of WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation for $20.3 million in cash, funded with cash on hand and borrowings from its senior secured credit agreement. This acquisition expanded Nexstar’s presence in this market and created a new duopoly market for the Company. Transaction costs relating to this acquisition, including legal and professional fees and travel of $0.1 million were expensed as incurred.


In addition, on December 1, 2011, Nexstar sold the FCC license, the broadcast rights and related liabilities and certain equipment of WTVW to Mission for $6.7 million in cash and entered into local service agreements with Mission for WTVW, similar to Nexstar’s other local service arrangements with Mission. Mission funded the acquisition cost with borrowings from its senior secured credit agreement. As Mission is consolidated into the Company for financial reporting purposes as discussed in Note 2, Mission recorded the net assets acquired at historical book values, rather than at fair values. The acquisition of WTVW by Mission was deemed to be a change in the reporting entity of Mission, thus the historical results of Mission have been presented as if WTVW was owned and operated by Mission as of the earliest period presented. All effects of the sale between Nexstar and Mission have been eliminated in consolidation.

WCWJ


On May 1, 2009, Nexstar acquired the assets of WCWJ for $18.0 million (base) subject to working capital adjustments. Nexstar viewed this acquisition as an opportunity to leverage its management expertise and increase profitability of the station by overlaying Nexstar’s existing retransmission compensation contracts and incorporating the Company’s cost reduction strategies. Cash available on hand was used to make a $1.0 million down payment in February 2009 and the remaining $16.2 million (net of working capital adjustment) was paid upon closing. Transaction costs such as legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services of $0.3 million were expensed as incurred.

KARZ
 
On March 12, 2009, Nexstar acquired substantially all of the assets of KARZ (formerly KWBF) for $4.0 million. The acquisition gave Nexstar an opportunity to further utilize existing retransmission compensation contracts and also to achieve duopoly synergies within the Little Rock market. In accordance with the purchase agreement, Nexstar made a down payment of $0.4 million in 2008. The remaining $3.6 million was paid from available cash on hand. Transaction costs such as legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services of $0.1 million were expensed as incurred.

In 2004, the FCC approved a spectrum allocation exchange between Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Nextel”) and public safety entities to eliminate interference caused to public safety radio licensees by Nextel’s operations. As part of this spectrum exchange, the FCC granted Nextel the right to certain spectrum within the 1.9 GHz band that was being used by television broadcasters. In order to utilize this spectrum, Nextel was required to relocate the broadcasters to new spectrum by replacing all analog equipment used by broadcasters with comparable digital equipment. The Company agreed to accept the substitute equipment that Nextel provided and in turn relinquished its existing equipment to Nextel. This transition began on a market by market basis beginning in the second quarter of 2007. The Company accounted for this arrangement as an exchange of nonmonetary assets. The equipment the Company received under this arrangement was recorded at their estimated fair market values and is being depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. Management’s determination of the fair market value was derived from the most recent prices paid to manufacturers and vendors for the specific equipment acquired. As equipment was exchanged, the Company recorded a gain to the extent that the fair market value of the equipment received exceeded the carrying amount of the equipment relinquished. Transactions under this program were completed in early 2010.

In 2001, an entity acquired by Nexstar sold certain of its telecommunications tower facilities for cash and then entered into noncancelable operating leases with the buyer for tower space. In connection with this transaction a $9.1 million gain on the sale was deferred and is being recognized over the lease term which expires in May 2021. The deferred gain as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $4.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, including $1.6 million and $1.7 million, repectively, in other liabilities of Mission and $0.4 million in current liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.


As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, included in net property and equipment is $3.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of costs related to the purchase of traffic software. The asset is being amortized over 10 years, based on the life of the contract. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the current portion of the liability associated with this contract of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, is included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion of $3.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company’s annual impairment tests of goodwill and FCC licenses performed as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 resulted in no impairment charge being recognized. No events or circumstances were noted leading management to conclude that impairment testing should be performed during 2011 or 2010 on the intangible assets subject to amortization.


The estimated useful life of network affiliation agreements contemplates renewals of the underlying agreements based on Nexstar’s and Mission’s historical ability to renew such agreements without significant cost or modifications to the conditions from which the value of the affiliation was derived. These renewals can result in estimated useful lives of individual affiliations ranging from 12 to 20 years. Management has determined that 15 years is a reasonable estimate within the range of such estimated useful lives.

6. Restructure Charge
 
In February 2009, Nexstar began regionalizing certain accounting and traffic functions. As a result, 93 employees were notified they would be terminated at various points in time through the end of May 2009. These employees were offered termination benefits that aggregated to $0.7 million. To receive any of the termination payments, the employees had to remain employed through their respective termination dates, as specified in the termination agreement. The Company recognized these costs ratably over the period of time between the notice of termination and the termination date.

 2011 Transactions


On April 15, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting entered into the Fourth Amendment to its Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment expands Nexstar Broadcasting’s Term Loan B by $50.0 million to $149.5 million, allows the proceeds of the credit facility to be used to refinance the existing notes held by Nexstar Broadcasting and Nexstar Holdings and retains its incremental term loan capacity of $100.0 million. The amendment also provides for payment of normal and customary fees and expenses. The net proceeds of the additional Term Loan B funding were used to redeem the remaining balance of the 11.375% Notes, for additional repurchases of outstanding notes and for general corporate purposes. The additional $50.0 million Term Loan B was funded on May 15, 2011.


On July 29, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Nexstar Credit Agreement”) and Mission entered into the Third Amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Mission Credit Agreement”). The amendments, among other things, removed as an event of default the termination of more than three stations’ network affiliation agreements with major networks and lowered the maximum consolidated Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission total leverage ratio to 7.50 to 1.00 through December 30, 2012 and 6.50 to 1.00 thereafter.


On July 1, 2011, Nexstar borrowed $19.3 million of its revolving loan in its senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of WFRV and WJMN in Green Bay, Wisconsin and Marquette, Michigan, respectively. On December 1, 2011, Nexstar borrowed $13.3 million of its revolving loan in its senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of WEHT in Evansville, Indiana and Mission borrowed $6.7 million of its revolving loan in its senior secured credit facility in connection with the acquisition of WTVW from Nexstar. See Note 3 for more details on the acquisitions. Throughout 2011, Nexstar made various net repayments on its revolving loans, resulting in a consolidated revolving loan balance of $24.3 million as of December 31, 2011.


On January 15, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed, on a pro rata basis, $12.5 million of its 11.375% Notes. Nexstar Holdings also repurchased $0.2 million outstanding 11.375% Notes in January 2011. Both transactions were priced at approximately 102%. On May 16, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed the remaining $33.2 million balance of its 11.375% Notes at the redemption price of 100.0%. These transactions resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million.


In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $24.2 million of its outstanding 7% PIK Notes at prices from 97.75% to 100.5%. These repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million.


In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $7.5 million of its outstanding 7% Notes at prices from 98.25% to 100.5%. These repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million.


Throughout 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission each paid the contractual maturities under their senior secured credit facilities, for a total payment of $1.4 million.

The Nexstar Broadcasting senior secured credit facility (the “Nexstar Facility”) consists of a Term Loan B and a $65.0 million revolving loan. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Nexstar had $109.7 million and $60.7 million, respectively, outstanding under its Term Loan B and $17.6 million and no amounts, respectively, outstanding under revolving loans.
 
The Term Loan B, which matures in September 2016, is payable in consecutive quarterly installments of 0.25%, with the remaining 94% due at maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repaid scheduled maturities of $1.0 million of Term Loan B. During the year ended December 31, 2010, repayments of Nexstar Broadcasting’s Term Loan B totaled $95.6 million including $92.4 million paid on April 19, 2010 in connection with an amendment to the credit facility and $3.2 million of scheduled maturities and a mandatory excess cash flow payment in the first quarter of 2010 as required under the terms of the previous credit facilities.
 
Interest rates are selected at Nexstar Broadcasting’s option and the applicable margin is adjusted quarterly as defined in the Nexstar Credit Agreement. The interest rate of Nexstar’s Term Loan B was 5.0% as of each of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the interest rate on Nexstar’s revolving loans was 4.3% as of December 31, 2011. Interest is payable periodically based on the type of interest rate selected. Additionally, Nexstar Broadcasting is required to pay quarterly commitment fees on the unused portion of its revolving loan commitment of 0.75% per annum.
 
Among other things, the Nexstar Facility prohibits Nexstar from paying more than an aggregate of $5.0 million in dividends to stockholders over the term of the Nexstar Credit Agreement.
 
The Mission Senior Secured Credit Facility
 
The Mission senior secured credit facility (the “Mission Facility”) consists of a Term Loan B and a $10.0 million revolving loan. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Mission had $38.4 million and $38.8 million, respectively, outstanding under its Term Loan B and $6.7 million and no amounts, respectively, revolving loans outstanding.
 
Terms of the Mission Facility, including repayment, maturity and interest rates, are the same as the terms of the Nexstar Facility described above. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Mission repaid scheduled maturities of $0.4 million of Term Loan B. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Mission repaid $126.6 million of its Term Loan B, including $126.0 million paid on April 19, 2010 in connection with an amendment to the credit facility and $0.6 million of scheduled maturities. Interest rates are selected at Mission’s option and the applicable margin is adjusted quarterly as defined in the Mission Credit Agreement. The interest rate of Mission’s Term Loan B was 5.0% as of each of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the interest rate on Mission’s revolving loans was 4.3% as of December 31, 2011.


 
Unused Commitments and Borrowing Availability


Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission had $50.7 million of total unused revolving loan commitments under their respective credit facilities, all of which was available for borrowing, based on the covenant calculations as of December 31, 2011. Nexstar Broadcasting’s ability to access funds under the Nexstar Facility depends, in part, on its compliance with certain financial covenants.
 
8.875% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes


On April 19, 2010, Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission, as co-issuers, completed the issuance and sale of $325.0 million senior secured second lien notes due 2017 (the “8.875% Notes”). The 8.875% Notes will mature on April 15, 2017. Interest on the 8.875% Notes accrues at a rate of 8.875% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year.


The 8.875% Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 19, 2010 (the “Indenture”), by and among Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission, as co-issuers, Nexstar, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee and collateral agent. Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s obligations under the 8.875% Notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nexstar and all of Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions.






 

  


F-21





  



The 8.875% Notes are secured by second-priority liens, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, on Nexstar Broadcasting’s, Mission’s, and the guarantors’ assets that secure Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s senior secured credit facilities on a first-priority lien basis. The 8.875% Notes and the guarantees are Nexstar Broadcasting’s, Mission’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations, rank equal in right of payment with all of Nexstar Broadcasting’s, Mission’s and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of Nexstar Broadcasting’s, Mission’s and the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness. The 8.875% Notes and the guarantees are effectively junior to Nexstar Broadcasting’s, Mission’s and the guarantors’ obligations which are either secured by assets that are not collateral or which are secured on a first priority basis, including borrowings under Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s senior secured credit facilities, in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations.
 
Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission have the option to redeem all or a portion of the 8.875% Notes at any time prior to April 15, 2014 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8.875% Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus applicable premium as of the date of redemption. At any time on or after April 15, 2014, Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission may redeem the 8.875% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. At any time before April 15, 2013, Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8.875% Notes at a redemption price of 108.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings.
 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the 8.875% Notes may require Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission to repurchase all or a portion of the 8.875% Notes in cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8.875% Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase.


The Indenture contains covenants that limit, among other things, Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s ability to (1) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock, (2) make certain restricted payments, (3) consummate specified asset sales, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, (5) create liens, (6) pay dividends or make other distributions, (7) make certain investments, (8) merge or consolidate with another person and (9) enter new lines of business.
 
The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, a failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. The Indenture also provides for events of default with respect to the collateral, which include (i) default in the performance of the security documents which adversely affects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the second priority liens on any collateral, individually or in the aggregate, having a fair market value in excess of $10.0 million, (ii) repudiation or disaffirmation by Nexstar Broadcasting, Mission or any guarantor of material obligations under the security documents, and (iii) the determination in a judicial proceeding that the security documents are unenforceable or invalid against Nexstar Broadcasting, Mission or any guarantor for any reason with respect to any collateral, individually or in the aggregate, having a fair market value in excess of $10.0 million. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, including additional interest, on all the notes to be due and payable.


The Company incurred $1.9 million in professional fees related to the transaction, which were capitalized as debt finance costs, included in other noncurrent assets, net on the balance sheet, and are being amortized over the term of the 8.875% Notes.


7% Senior Subordinated Notes and 7% Senior Subordinated PIK Notes
 
On December 30, 2003, Nexstar Broadcasting issued $125.0 million of 7% Notes at par. The 7% Notes mature on January 15, 2014. Interest is payable every six months in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The 7% Notes are guaranteed by all of the domestic existing and future restricted subsidiaries of Nexstar Broadcasting and by Mission. The 7% Notes are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations subordinated to all of the Company’s senior secured credit facilities. The 7% Notes are redeemable on or after January 15, 2009, at declining premiums. The proceeds of the offering were used to finance an acquisition.





  


F-22





  



On April 1, 2005, Nexstar Broadcasting issued an additional $75.0 million of 7% Notes at a price of 98.01%. Proceeds obtained under the offering were net of a $1.1 million payment provided to investors purchasing the notes which was included as a component of the discount.
 
In March 2009, Nexstar Broadcasting completed the exchange of $143.6 million of its outstanding $191.5 million of 7% Notes in exchange for (i) $142.3 million of Nexstar Broadcasting’s 7% PIK Notes, to be guaranteed by each of the existing guarantors to the 7% Notes and (ii) cash. The 7% PIK Notes mature on January 15, 2014, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 7% PIK Notes are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations subordinated to all of Nexstar Broadcasting’s senior debt. Nexstar Broadcasting pays interest on the 7% PIK Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2009. From the date of issuance through January 15, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting paid interest on the 7% PIK Notes entirely by issuing additional 7% PIK Notes (the “PIK Interest”). PIK Interest accrued on the 7% PIK Notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.5%, calculated on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis. From and after January 15, 2011, all 7% PIK Notes (including those received as PIK Interest) accrue interest in cash at a rate of 7% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on July 15, 2011. The effective interest rate on the 7% Notes and the 7% PIK Notes approximates the stated interest rate. Total cash consideration paid to tendering bondholders was $17.7 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of existing debt. The Company incurred $2.9 million in fees related to the transaction, including banking, legal and accounting fees, which were charged to selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $7.5 million of its outstanding 7% Notes at prices from 98.25% to 100.5%, resulting in a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million. In the year ended December 31, 2010, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $3.4 million of its outstanding 7% Notes at prices from  93% to 99%.
 
In the year ended December 31, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $24.2 million of its outstanding 7% PIK Notes at prices from 97.75% to 100.5%, resulting in a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million. In the year ended December 31, 2010, Nexstar Broadcasting repurchased an aggregate of $6.7 million of its outstanding 7% PIK Notes at prices from 88.8% to 90.25%, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million.


11.375% Senior Discount Notes
 
On March 27, 2003, Nexstar Holdings issued $130.0 million principal amount at maturity of 11.375% Notes at a price of 57.442%. The effective interest rate on the 11.375% Notes approximates the stated interest rate. The 11.375% Notes mature on April 1, 2013. The 11.375% Notes began accruing cash interest on April 1, 2008 with payments due every six months in arrears on April 1 and October 1.
 
The 11.375% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations effectively subordinated to the Nexstar Facility and are structurally subordinated to the 7% Notes and 7% PIK Notes.
 
On January 15, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed, on a pro rata basis, $12.5 million of its 11.375% Notes. Nexstar Holdings also repurchased $0.2 million outstanding 11.375% Notes in January 2011. Both transactions were priced at approximately 102%. On May 16, 2011, Nexstar Holdings redeemed the remaining $33.2 million balance of its 11.375% Notes at the redemption price of 100.0%. These transactions resulted in a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million. In November 2010, Nexstar Holdings repurchased $4.1 million of the 11.375% Notes at 103%, resulting in a loss of $0.2 million.
 
Guarantee of Senior Subordinated Notes
 
Nexstar has executed full and unconditional guarantees, subject to certain customary release provisions, with respect to the 7% Notes, the 7% PIK Notes and the 8.875% Notes, each issued by Nexstar Broadcasting. Mission is also a guarantor of the 7% Notes and 7% PIK Notes.
 
Collateralization and Guarantees of Debt
 
The Credit Facilities described above are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all the combined assets, excluding FCC licenses, of Nexstar and Mission. Nexstar and its subsidiaries guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under the Mission Facility in the event of Mission’s default. Similarly, Mission is a guarantor of the Nexstar Facility and the senior subordinated notes issued by Nexstar Broadcasting.
 
In consideration of Nexstar’s guarantee of the Mission Facility, Mission has granted Nexstar a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These option agreements (which expire on various dates between 2012 and 2021) are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission. The Company expects these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration.

9. Contract Termination
 
On March 31, 2008, Nexstar signed a ten year agreement for national sales representation with two units of Katz Television Group, a subsidiary of Katz Media Group (“Katz”), transferring 24 stations in 14 of its markets from Petry Television Inc. (“Petry”) and Blair Television Inc. (“Blair”). Nexstar, Blair, Petry and Katz entered into a termination and mutual release agreement under which Blair agreed to release Nexstar from its future contractual obligations in exchange for payments totaling $8.0 million. Katz is making the payments on behalf of Nexstar as an inducement for Nexstar to enter into the long-term contract with Katz. A liability of $7.2 million, representing the present value of the payments Katz is making to Blair, was recorded and is bein recognized as a non-cash reduction to operating expenses over the term of the agreement with Katz. Effective May 1, 2009, Nexstar signed another agreement to transfer the remaining Nexstar stations to Katz and its related companies. Moving these contracts resulted in Nexstar cancelling multiple contracts with Blair. As a result, Blair sued the Company for additional termination fees. Katz indemnified the Company for all expenses related to the settlement and defense of this lawsuit. The lawsuit was settled effective May 7, 2010. Termination of these contracts resulted in an additional liability of $0.2 million, which is being recognized over the remaining contract term with Katz.


As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, $0.7 million of this liability was included in other current liabilities and $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, was included in deferred representation fee incentive in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized $0.8 million of these incentives as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

11. Common Stock
 
The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock generally vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Holders of Class C common stock have no voting rights.
 
The shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock are convertible as follows: (i) holders of shares of Class B common stock or Class C common stock may elect at any time to convert their shares into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock; or (ii) the Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis if the holder transfers to anyone other than a certain group of shareholders; or (iii) if Class B common stock represents less than 10.0% of the total common stock outstanding, all of the Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 
The Common stockholders are entitled to receive cash dividends, subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, on an equal per share basis. The Nexstar Facility prohibits Nexstar from paying more than an aggregate of $5.0 million in dividends to stockholders over the term of the Nexstar Credit Agreement.

12. Stock-Based Compensation Plans
 
Stock Option Repricing
 
In 2010, Nexstar repriced outstanding stock options with an exercise price of $5.00 or more to a new exercise price equal to the closing price of the stock on the repricing date of $4.56 per share. The repricing impacted options to purchase 1,970,000 shares of Class A common stock, held by 34 employees. The total incremental cost of the repricing was calculated to be $1.8 million, which represents the incremental fair value of the modified awards. Of the $1.8 million total incremental cost, $1.6 million was recognized and included in selling, general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2010. The remaining incremental cost is being recognized over the remaining vesting period of the affected options. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes calculations for the before and after modification valuations on May 27, 2010 were as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
 
The Company measures compensation cost related to stock options based on the grant-date fair value of the awards, calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over their respective vesting periods. Nexstar granted no options during the year ended December 31, 2011. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:





  


    2010   




    2009   




Expected volatility


89.9 – 97.0%

Expected life


6 – 7 years


6 years



Dividend yields


None


None



Weighted-average fair value per share of options granted


$3.83


$0.61





The expected volatility assumptions used for stock options grants were based on Nexstar’s historical volatility rates over a period approximating the expected life of the options. During the year ended December 31, 2009, historical rates were combined with the volatilities of peer companies in the television broadcasting industry, due to Nexstar’s limited history of publicly traded shares. The expected term assumption is calculated utilizing Nexstar’s historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation experience combined with expectations developed over outstanding options. The risk-free interest rates used are based on the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of the grant having a period commensurate with the expected term assumption.
 
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million, $2.8 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010 includes the expense for the repricing. The Company does not currently recognize a tax benefit resulting from compensation costs expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations because the Company provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset resulting from this type of temporary difference since it expects that it will not have sufficient future taxable income to realize such benefit. As of December 31, 2011, there was $1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans
 
Nexstar has two stock-based employee compensation plans: the 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) and the 2003 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2003 Plan”) (collectively, the “Equity Plans”), which provide for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance awards to directors, employees of Nexstar or consultants. A maximum of 1,500,000 shares and 3,000,000 of Nexstar’s Class A common stock can be issued under the 2006 Plan and 2003 Plan, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, a total of 457,000 and 171,000 shares were available for future grant under the 2006 Plan and 2003 Plan, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2011, options to purchase 3,771,000 shares of Nexstar’s Class A common stock were outstanding under the Equity Plans. Options are granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of the grant, vest over five years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Except as otherwise determined by the compensation committee or with respect to the termination of a participant’s services in certain circumstances, including a change of control, no option may be exercised within six months of the date of the grant. Upon the employee’s termination, all nonvested options are forfeited immediately and any unexercised vested options are cancelled from 30 to 180 days following the termination date. Nexstar issues new shares of its Class A common stock when options are exercised.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the closing market price of Nexstar’s common stock on the last day of the fiscal period, which was $7.84 on December 31, 2011, and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding.



 
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised, on their respective exercise dates, was $41 thousand, $27 thousand and $5 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate fair value of options vested during the year was $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.


13. Gain on Casualty Loss
 
On February 2, 2009, the building in Port Arthur, Texas suffered extensive fire damage resulting in a total loss of the building. The operations previously performed in this building had been moved to Little Rock, Arkansas prior to the fire. The building was fully insured and the payout on the claim resulted in a net gain of $1.0 million. 
 
On May 8, 2009, a transmission tower at KSNF collapsed, damaging a portion of the facility and nearby property. The settlement of the claim resulted in a net gain of $2.3 million, which is included in gain on asset disposal, net. Of the insurance proceeds received, $0.5 million was related to business interruption.

The provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of deferred income taxes resulting from the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes. These deferred tax liabilities do not reverse on a scheduled basis and are not used to support the realization of deferred tax assets. The Company’s deferred tax assets before valuation allowance primarily result from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). The Company’s NOLs are available to reduce future taxable income if utilized before their expiration. The Company has provided a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets as it does not believe they are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable earnings.

If the gross unrecognized tax benefit were recognized, it would result in a favorable effect on the Company’s effective tax rate excluding the impact on the Company’s valuation allowance position. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next twelve months.
 
 
Interest expense and penalties related to the Company’s uncertain tax positions would be reflected as a component of income tax expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not accrue interest on the unrecognized tax benefits as an unfavorable outcome upon examination would not result in a cash outlay but would reduce NOLs subject to a valuation allowance.


The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years after 2007. Additionally, any NOLs that were generated in prior years and will be utilized in the future may also be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. State jurisdictions that remain subject to examination are not considered significant.


The valuation allowance increased by $5.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to the generation of current year net operating losses, the benefit of which may not be realized.


As of December 31, 2011, the Company has NOLs available of $463.5 million which are available to reduce future taxable income if utilized before their expiration. The federal NOLs expire through 2031 if not utilized. Utilization of NOLs in the future may be limited if changes in the Company’s ownership occurs.

15. FCC Regulatory Matters


Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of television broadcasting stations except under a license issued by the FCC, and empowers the FCC, among other things, to issue, revoke, and modify broadcasting licenses, determine the location of television stations, regulate the equipment used by television stations, adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and impose penalties for the violation of such regulations. The FCC’s ongoing rule making proceedings could have a significant future impact on the television industry and on the operation of the Company’s stations and the stations to which it provides services. In addition, the U.S. Congress may act to amend the Communications Act or adopt other legislation in a manner that could impact the Company’s stations, the stations to which it provides services and the television broadcast industry in general.


The FCC has adopted rules with respect to the final conversion of existing low power and television translator stations to digital operations. The FCC has established a September 1, 2015 deadline by which low power and television translator stations must cease analog operations, with low power and television translator stations operating on channels 52-69 being required to cease operation on those channels by December 31, 2011. The Company holds three low power analog station licenses and 13 analog television translator station licenses, three of which, although they were required to cease analog operations by December 31, 2011, have been granted temporary authority to continue analog operations until March 30, 2012, with the remainder to transition to digital operations by September 1, 2015.
 
Media Ownership


In 2006, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to review all of its media ownership rules, as required by the Communications Act. The FCC considered rules relating to ownership of two or more TV stations in a market, ownership of local TV and radio stations by daily newspapers in the same market, cross-ownership of local TV and radio stations, and changes to how the national TV ownership limits are calculated. In February 2008, the FCC adopted modest changes to its newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rule while retaining the rest of its ownership rules then currently in effect. On July 7, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC’s changes to its newspaper/ broadcast cross-ownership rule while upholding the FCC’s retention of its other media ownership rules.


The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity”. During 2009, the FCC held a series of hearings designed to evaluate possible changes to its rules. In May 2010, the FCC formally initiated its 2010 review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a Notice of Inquiry (NOI). The NOI was intended to assist the FCC in establishing a framework within which to analyze whether its media ownership rules remain “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition,” due to the dramatic changes occurring in the media marketplace. Numerous parties filed comments and reply comments in response to the NOI. In June and July 2011, the FCC released to the public eleven economic studies related to its media ownership rules. In December 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to seek comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules. Among the specific changes proposed in the NPRM are (1) elimination of the contour overlap provision of the local television ownership rule (making the rule entirely DMA-based), (2) elimination of the radio/television cross-ownership rule, and (3) modest relaxation of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule along the lines of the changes in the 2006 proceeding that the court vacated. The NPRM also seeks comment on shared services agreements (SSAs) and other joint operating arrangements between television stations, and whether such agreements should be considered attributable. Initial comments on the NPRM were due on March 5, 2012 and reply comments are due in April 2012.  The Company cannot predict what rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted.

Spectrum
 
The FCC has initiated various proceedings to assess the availability of spectrum to meet future wireless broadband needs. The FCC’s March 2010 “National Broadband Plan” recommends the reallocation of 120 megahertz of the spectrum currently used for broadcast television for wireless broadband use. The FCC has thus far requested comment on proposals that include, among other things, whether to add new frequency allocations in the television bands for licensed fixed and mobile wireless uses, whether to permit two television stations to share a single 6 megahertz channel and whether to implement technical rule modifications to improve the viability of certain channels that are underutilized by digital television stations. In February 2012, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the FCC to conduct incentive auctions whereby spectrum holders, including television broadcasters, could voluntarily relinquish all or part of their spectrum in exchange for consideration. A reallocation of television spectrum for wireless broadband use would likely involve a “repacking” of the television broadcast band, which would require some television stations to change channel or otherwise modify their technical facilities. Future steps to reallocate television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of the Company’s investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. The Company cannot predict the timing or results of television spectrum reallocation efforts or their impact to its business.
 
Retransmission Consent
 
On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC has also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute. If the FCC prohibits joint negotiations or modifies the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, such changes likely would affect the Company’s ability to sustain its current level of retransmission consent revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the resolution of the proposals or their impact to its business.

Guarantee of Mission Debt
 
Nexstar and its subsidiaries guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under the Mission Facility. In the event that Mission is unable to repay amounts due, Nexstar will be obligated to repay such amounts. The maximum potential amount of future payments that Nexstar would be required to make under this guarantee would be generally limited to the borrowings outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, Mission had a maximum commitment of $48.4 million under its senior secured credit facility, of which $45.1 million of debt was outstanding.
 
Indemnification Obligations
 
In connection with certain agreements that the Company enters into in the normal course of its business, including local service agreements, business acquisitions and borrowing arrangements, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company agrees to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from losses, claims and damages incurred by the indemnified party for certain events as defined within the particular contract. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification arrangements may be unlimited. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been insignificant and the Company has not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.


Collective Bargaining Agreements
 
As of December 31, 2011, certain technical, production and news employees at six of the Company’s stations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that employee relations are satisfactory and has not experienced any work stoppages at any of its stations. However, there can be no assurance that the collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future or that the Company will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.


Litigation


From time to time, the Company is involved with claims that arise out of the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, any resulting liability with respect to these claims would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

17. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
 
The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, each of its 100%, directly or indirectly, owned subsidiaries and its consolidated VIE. This information is presented in lieu of separate financial statements and other related disclosures pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, “Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered.”  
 
The Nexstar column presents the parent company’s financial information (not including any subsidiaries). The Nexstar Holdings column presents its financial information (not including any subsidiaries). The Nexstar Broadcasting column presents its financial information. The Mission column presents the financial information of Mission, an entity which Nexstar Broadcasting is required to consolidate as a VIE (see Note 2). Neither Mission nor Nexstar Broadcasting has any subsidiaries.
 
On December 1, 2011, Nexstar Broadcasting sold WTVW to Mission for $6.7 million (See Note 3). As Mission is consolidated into the Company for financial reporting purposes, Mission recorded the net assets acquired at historical book values, rather than at fair values. The acquisition of WTVW by Mission was deemed to be a change in the reporting entity of Mission, thus the historical results of Mission have been presented as if WTVW was owned and operated by Mission as of the earliest period presented. All effects of the sale between Nexstar and Mission have been eliminated in consolidation.


The Company and its subsidiaries have the following notes outstanding (See Note 8):
 




1.  


Nexstar Holdings had the 11.375% Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The 11.375% Notes were redeemed in full in May 2011.



 




2.  


Nexstar Broadcasting has the following notes outstanding: 



 




  


(a)  


7% Notes. The 7% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nexstar and Mission, subject to certain customary release provisions. These notes are not guaranteed by any other entities.



 




  


(b)  


7% PIK Notes. The 7% PIK Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nexstar and Mission, subject to certain customary release provisions. These notes are not guaranteed by any other entities.



 




  


(c)  


8.875% Notes. The 8.875% Notes are co-issued by Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission, jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nexstar and all of Nexstar Broadcasting’s and Mission’s future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions. The net proceeds to Mission and Nexstar from the sale of the 8.875% Notes were $316.8 million, net of $8.2 million original issuance discount. Mission received $131.9 million of the net proceeds and $184.9 million was received by Nexstar Broadcasting. As the obligations under the 8.875% Notes are joint and several to Nexstar Broadcasting and Mission, each entity reflects the full amount of the 8.875% Notes and related accrued interest in their separate Financial Statements. Further, the portions of the net proceeds and related accrued interest attributable to the respective co-issuer are reflected as a reduction to equity (due from affiliate) in their separate financial statements given the contractual relationships between the entities.

18. Employee Benefits
 
Nexstar and Mission have established retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Plans”). The Plans cover substantially all employees of Nexstar and Mission who meet minimum age and service requirements, and allow participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Employer contributions to the Plans may be made at the discretion of Nexstar and Mission. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, Nexstar contributed $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to the Nexstar Plan and Mission contributed $16 thousand and $14 thousand, respectively, to the Mission Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2009, neither Nexstar nor Mission made contributions to the Plans.
 
Under a collective bargaining agreement, the Company contributes three percent of the gross monthly payroll of certain covered employees toward their pension benefits. Employees must have completed 90 days of service to be eligible for the contribution. The Company’s pension benefit contribution totaled $27 thousand, $24 thousand and $26 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
