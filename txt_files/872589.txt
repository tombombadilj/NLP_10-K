General 
     Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a
fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops,
manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical
conditions. We currently have two marketed products:

EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, known
  in the scientific literature as VEGF Trap-Eye, which is available in the
  United States for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular
  degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is the leading cause of acquired blindness for
  people over the age of 65 in the United States and Europe; and 
ARCALYST® (rilonacept) Injection for
  Subcutaneous Use, which is available by prescription in the United States for
  the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including
  Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome
  (MWS) in adults and children 12 and older.
     We have 13 product candidates in
clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories.
Our Trap-based, late-stage programs are: 

EYLEA®, which is being developed for
  the treatment of additional serious eye diseases; 
ZALTRAP® (aflibercept), known in the
  scientific literature as VEGF Trap, which is being developed in oncology in
  collaboration with Sanofi; and 
ARCALYST®, which is being developed for
  the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering
  treatment.
     Our antibody-based clinical programs
include the following fully human monoclonal antibodies: 

Sarilumab (REGN88), an antibody to the
  interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is being developed in rheumatoid
  arthritis; 
REGN727, an antibody to Proprotein Convertase
  Substilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is being developed for low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction; 
REGN668, an antibody to the interleukin-4 receptor
  (IL-4R), which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic
  asthma; 
REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4
  (Dll4), a novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;
  
REGN910, an antibody to Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2),
  another novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;
  
REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF),
  which is being developed for the treatment of pain (currently on clinical
  hold); 
REGN728, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target; 
REGN1033, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target;
REGN846, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target, which is being developed in atopic dermatitis;
  and 
REGN1154, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target.
2


     With the
exception of REGN475, REGN846, and REGN1154, which we are developing independently, all of
these antibodies are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi.
    
Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic
scientific research and discovery-enabling technologies, to combine that
foundation with our clinical development and manufacturing capabilities, and to
continue to expand our commercialization capabilities in anticipation of
possible regulatory approval and launch of one or more of our late-stage product
candidates. Our long-term objective is to build a successful, integrated,
multi-product biopharmaceutical company that provides patients and medical
professionals with innovative options for preventing and treating human
diseases.
    
We believe that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by
the application of our VelociSuite technology platforms. Our
discovery platforms are designed to identify specific proteins of therapeutic
interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate these targets
through high-throughput production of genetically modified mice using our
VelociGene® technology to understand the role of these proteins in
normal physiology, as well as in models of disease. Our human monoclonal
antibody technology (VelocImmune®) and cell line
expression technologies (VelociMab®) may then be
utilized to discover and produce new product candidates directed against the
disease target. Our antibody product candidates currently in clinical trials
were developed using VelocImmune®. Under the terms of our
antibody collaboration with Sanofi, which was expanded during 2009, we plan to
advance a total of 20 to 30 candidates into clinical development over the life
of the agreement. We continue to invest in the development of enabling
technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, manufacture, and
commercialize new product candidates. 
Commercial
Products: 
EYLEA®(aflibercept) Injection  wet
AMD 
     In November 2011, we
received U.S. marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for EYLEA® Injection for the treatment of patients with wet
AMD. The approval of EYLEA® was granted by the FDA under a Priority
Review, a designation that is given to drugs that offer major advances in
treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Net product
sales of EYLEA® in 2011 were $24.8 million.
    
EYLEA®, known in the scientific literature as VEGF Trap-Eye,
is a fusion protein locally administered in the eye that is designed to bind
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF)
proteins that are involved in the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. The
abnormal growth of new blood vessels could leak blood and fluid, which causes
disruption and dysfunction of the retina creating distortion and/or blind spots
in central vision.
    
We are collaborating with Bayer HealthCare on the global development of
EYLEA®. Bayer HealthCare has submitted applications for marketing
authorization in the European Union, Japan, and other countries for wet AMD.
Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA® outside the United States, where
the companies will share equally the profits from any future sales of
EYLEA®. We maintain exclusive rights to EYLEA® in the
United States and are entitled to all profits from any such sales. 
ARCALYST®
 CAPS 
    
Net product sales of ARCALYST® (rilonacept) in 2011 were $19.9
million. Net product sales of ARCALYST® in 2010 were $25.3 million,
which included $20.5 million of ARCALYST® net product sales made in
2010 and $4.8 million of previously deferred net product sales, as described
below under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.
    
ARCALYST® is a protein-based product designed to bind the
interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell
surface receptors. ARCALYST® is available by prescription in the
United States for the treatment of CAPS, including FCAS and MWS in adults and
children 12 and older. CAPS are a group of rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory
conditions characterized by life-long, recurrent symptoms of rash, fever/chills,
joint pain, eye redness/pain, and fatigue. Intermittent, disruptive
exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by exposure to cooling
temperatures, stress, exercise, or other unknown stimuli.

Clinical
Programs: 
1. EYLEA® 
Ophthalmologic Diseases 
     We, together
with our ex-U.S. collaborator Bayer HealthCare, are evaluating EYLEA®
in Phase 3 programs in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO),
diabetic macular edema (DME), and choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) of the
retina as a result of pathologic myopia. We plan on initiating a Phase 3 study
in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the first quarter of 2012. Wet AMD,
diabetic retinopathy (which includes DME), and retinal vein occlusion are three
of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In these
conditions, severe visual loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and
neovascular proliferation.
    
The Phase 3 trials in wet AMD, known as VIEW 1 and VIEW 2
(VEGF Trap:
Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet age-related macular degeneration),
compared EYLEA® and Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection), a
registered trademark of Genentech, Inc. Lucentis® is an anti-VEGF
agent approved for use and the current standard of care in wet AMD. VIEW 1 was
conducted in North America and VIEW 2 was conducted in Europe, Asia Pacific,
Japan, and Latin America. The VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials both evaluated
EYLEA® doses of 0.5 milligrams (mg) and 2.0 mg at dosing intervals of
four weeks and 2.0 mg at a dosing interval of eight weeks (following three
initial monthly doses), compared with Lucentis® dosed according to
its U.S. label, which specifies doses of 0.5 mg administered every four weeks
over the first year. The primary endpoint of these non-inferiority studies was
the proportion of patients treated with EYLEA® who maintain visual
acuity at the end of one year compared to patients dosed monthly with
Lucentis®. Visual acuity is defined as the total number of letters
read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart,
a standard research tool for measuring visual acuity. Maintenance of vision is
defined as losing fewer than three lines (equivalent to 15 letters) on the ETDRS
chart. Secondary endpoints included the mean change from baseline in visual
acuity as measured by ETDRS, the proportion of patients who gained at least 15
letters of vision at week 52, and the amount of fluid under the
retina.
    
We and Bayer HealthCare announced week 52 results from the VIEW 1 and
VIEW 2 studies in November 2010. In these studies, all regimens of
EYLEA®, including EYLEA® dosed every two months,
successfully met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to
Lucentis® dosed every month. A generally favorable safety profile was
observed for both EYLEA® and Lucentis®. The incidence of
ocular treatment emergent adverse events was balanced across all four treatment
groups in both studies, with the most frequent events associated with the
injection procedure, the underlying disease, and/or the aging process. The most
frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage, macular
degeneration, eye pain, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. The most
frequent serious non-ocular adverse events were typical of those reported in
this elderly population who receive intravitreal treatment for wet AMD; the most
frequently reported events were falls, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, atrial
fibrillation, breast cancer, and acute coronary syndrome. There were no notable
differences among the study arms. 
    
Based on these positive results, we submitted a Biologics License
Application (BLA) to the FDA in February 2011 for marketing approval of
EYLEA® in wet AMD in the United States. In April 2011, the FDA
accepted the BLA for filing and granted our request for Priority Review. In June
2011, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA
unanimously recommended that the FDA approve our BLA. In 2011, Bayer HealthCare
submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of EYLEA® in
wet AMD in the European Union, Japan, and other countries. In November 2011, we
received U.S. marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA® Injection
for the treatment of patients with wet AMD.
    
In December 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare announced Year 2 results from
the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies. In the second year of the studies, patients were
treated with the same dose per injection as in the first year and were evaluated
monthly to determine need for retreatment. Patients were treated at least every
12 weeks. All Year 2 analyses were considered exploratory. In an integrated
analysis of the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies, the visual acuity gain from baseline
in the EYLEA® 2.0 mg every eight week group at week 96 was 7.6
letters compared to 8.4 letters at week 52, with an average of 11.2 injections
over two years and 4.2 injections during the second year. The visual acuity gain
from baseline in the monthly Lucentis® group at week 96 was 7.9
letters compared to 8.7 letters at week 52, with an average of 16.5 injections
over two years and 4.7 injections during the second year. The results of each of
the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies were consistent with the integrated
analysis.
    
The overall fewer average number of injections in the second year in the
EYLEA® 2.0 mg every eight week group compared to the
Lucentis® group (4.2 versus 4.7; nominal p<0.0001) was driven by
the fact that fewer patients needed more intense therapy in the
EYLEA® group and those patients required fewer injections.
4


    
The proportion of patients who required frequent injections (six or more)
during Year 2 was lower in the EYLEA® 2.0 mg every eight week
group compared to the Lucentis® group (15.9% versus 26.5%). In the
25% of patients who required the most intense therapy (the greatest number of
injections), patients in the EYLEA® 2.0 mg every eight week group
required an average of 1.4 fewer injections in Year 2 compared to the
Lucentis® group (6.6 versus 8.0). In the 25% of patients in each
group who had the fewest number of injections in Year 2, the average number of
injections was similar (approximately 3 for both groups, corresponding to the
protocol-mandated minimum number of injections). 
    
A generally favorable safety profile was observed for both
EYLEA® and Lucentis®. The incidence of ocular treatment
emergent adverse events was balanced across all four treatment groups in both
studies. The most frequent ocular adverse events (greater than 10% of patients
for the overall study population) were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain,
retinal hemorrhage, and visual acuity reduced. The most frequent serious
non-ocular adverse events were typical of those reported in this elderly
population who receive intravitreal treatment for wet AMD; the most frequently
reported events (greater than 1% of patients for the overall study population)
were falls, pneumonia, myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation. There were
no notable differences among the study arms. The incidence of arterial
thrombotic events as defined by the "Anti-Platelet Trialists" group criteria was
3.2% of patients for Lucentis® and 3.3% of patients in the combined
EYLEA® groups. 
    
In the fourth quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated a Phase
3 trial, known as SIGHT, evaluating the efficacy and safety of EYLEA®
in the neovascular form of wet AMD in China. EYLEA® will be evaluated
for its effect on improving and maintaining vision when dosed as an intravitreal
injection on a schedule of 2.0 mg every two months (following three initial
monthly doses), as compared with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with verteporfin.
After assessment of the primary endpoint at week 28, all patients, including
those on PDT, will receive EYLEA® treatment until the end of the
study at week 52. The trial will include approximately 300 patients and will be
the largest retinal trial conducted in China. The SIGHT trial is being led by
Bayer HealthCare.
     EYLEA®
was also in Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of CRVO, another
cause of visual impairment. We led the COPERNICUS (COntrolled Phase
3 Evaluation of Repeated iNtravitreal administration of VEGF Trap-Eye In Central retinal vein
occlusion: Utility and Safety) study, and Bayer HealthCare led the
GALILEO (General Assessment Limiting InfiLtration of Exudates in central retinal vein
Occlusion with VEGF Trap-Eye) study. Patients in both studies received
six monthly intravitreal injections of either EYLEA® at a dose of 2.0 mg or sham control injections. The primary
endpoint of both studies was improvement in visual acuity versus baseline
after six months of treatment as measured by the ETDRS eye chart. At the end of the initial six months, patients were
dosed on an as-needed (PRN) basis for another six months. All patients
were eligible for rescue laser treatment. In
the COPERNICUS study, patients who were randomized to sham injections in the first six months were eligible to cross over to EYLEA®
PRN dosing in the second six months.
    
In December 2010, we and Bayer HealthCare announced that in the
COPERNICUS study, EYLEA® demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in visual acuity at six months compared to sham injections, the
primary endpoint of the study. In this study, 56.1% of patients receiving
EYLEA® gained at least 15 letters of vision from baseline, compared
to 12.3% of patients receiving sham injections (p<0.0001). In the study,
EYLEA® was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events
were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying
disease. Serious ocular adverse events in the EYLEA® group were
uncommon (3.5%), consisting of individual reports of corneal abrasion,
endophalmitis, retinal vein occlusion, and reduced visual acuity, and were more
frequent in the control group (13.5%). The incidence of non-ocular serious
adverse events was generally well-balanced between the treatment arms. There
were no deaths among the 114 patients treated with EYLEA® and two
(2.7%) in the 73 patients treated with sham injections.
    
The one-year COPERNICUS results showed that 55.3% of patients receiving
EYLEA® dosed monthly for 24 weeks, then on  a PRN basis (guided by anatomic
and visual acuity monitoring) over the next 28 weeks, gained at least 15 letters
from baseline on an ETDRS eye chart compared to 30.1% of patients who received
sham injections for the first 24 weeks followed by EYLEA® PRN from week 24 to
week 52 (p=0.0006).  In terms of gain in visual acuity from baseline to
week 52, patients receiving EYLEA® monthly for 24 weeks followed by EYLEA® PRN
gained, on average, 16.2 letters of vision compared to a mean gain of 3.8
letters for patients who switched at week 24 from sham to EYLEA® PRN
(p<0.0001).   These results demonstrate that the benefits achieved
with monthly EYLEA® treatment through week 24 were maintained out to week
52.  At week 24, patients receiving EYLEA® had a mean gain of 17.3 letters,
while patients receiving sham had a mean loss of 4.0 letters
(p<0.0001).  Patients who received EYLEA® monthly followed by EYLEA®
PRN, were administered a mean of 2.7 EYLEA® injections from week 24 to 52, while
patients who switched from sham to EYLEA® PRN received a mean of 3.9 EYLEA®
injections.  EYLEA® was generally well tolerated in the study.  At
week 52, the most frequently reported adverse events in patients who went from
monthly EYLEA® to EYLEA® PRN were reduction of visual acuity, conjunctival
hemorrhage, eye pain, and intraocular pressure increased.  The most
frequently reported adverse events in patients who switched from sham to EYLEA®
PRN were reduction of visual acuity, conjunctival hemorrhage, intraocular
pressure increased, and retinal hemorrhage.  At week 52, 5.3% of patients
receiving EYLEA® who switched to EYLEA® PRN and 16.2% of patients who switched
from sham to EYLEA® PRN reported at least one ocular serious adverse
event.
    
In April 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare announced that in the GALILEO
study, EYLEA® also demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in visual acuity at six months compared to sham injections, the
primary endpoint of the study. In this trial, 60.2% of patients receiving 2.0 mg
of EYLEA® monthly gained at least 15 letters of vision from baseline,
compared to 22.1% of patients receiving sham injections (p<0.0001). Patients
receiving 2.0 mg of EYLEA® monthly gained, on average, 18 letters of
vision compared to a mean gain of 3.3 letters with sham injections
(p<0.0001), a secondary endpoint. 
    
As in the COPERNICUS trial, EYLEA® was generally well
tolerated in the GALILEO study and the most common adverse events were those
typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease.
Serious ocular adverse events in the EYLEA® group were 2.9% and were
more frequent in the control group (8.8%). The most frequently reported adverse
events overall in the EYLEA® arm were eye pain, conjunctival
hemorrhage, and elevated intraocular pressure. The most frequently reported
adverse events in the control group were macular edema, eye irritation, and
reduced visual acuity. The incidence of non-ocular serious adverse events was
generally well-balanced between the treatment arms. The most frequent non-ocular
adverse events were headache and nasopharyngitis. There were no deaths in the
study. 
     
The one-year GALILEO results showed that 60.2% of patients receiving EYLEA®
dosed monthly for 24 weeks, then on a PRN basis (guided by anatomic and visual
acuity monitoring) over the next 28 weeks, gained at least 15 letters from
baseline on an ETDRS eye chart compared to 32.4% of patients receiving sham
injections (p=0.0004).  In terms of gain in visual acuity from baseline to
week 52, patients receiving EYLEA® gained, on average, 16.9 letters of vision
compared to a mean gain of 3.8 letters for patients receiving sham injections
(p<0.0001).  These results demonstrate that the benefits achieved with
monthly EYLEA® treatment through week 24 were maintained out to week 52. 
At week 24, patients receiving EYLEA® had a mean gain of 18 letters compared to
a mean gain of 3.3 letters for patients with sham injections (p<0.0001).
Patients treated with EYLEA® received an average of 2.5 EYLEA® injections from
week 24 to week 52.  EYLEA® was generally well tolerated in the
study.  At week 52, the most frequently reported adverse events overall in
the EYLEA® arm were macular edema, elevated intraocular pressure, eye pain,
conjunctival hemorrhage, and retinal hemorrhage.  The most frequently
reported adverse events in the sham group were macular edema, retinal
hemorrhage, retinal vascular disorder, reduction of visual acuity and eye
irritation.  At week 52, 9.6% of patients in the EYLEA® arm and 8.8% of
patients in the sham arm presented with at least one ocular serious adverse
event.

     Based on the
positive six-month results in the COPERNICUS and GALILEO studies, we submitted a supplemental BLA for U.S.
regulatory approval  of EYLEA® in CRVO in November 2011. Under the Prescription Drug User  Fee Act (PDUFA),
we were granted a target date for an FDA decision on our  EYLEA® supplemental BLA of September 23, 2012.
Bayer HealthCare plans  to submit regulatory applications in this indication in Europe in late 2012 or  early 2013. 
    
In the second quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated Phase 3
studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EYLEA® in DME. These
clinical trials have three study arms. In the first arm, patients will be
treated every month with 2.0 mg of EYLEA®. In the second arm,
patients will be treated with 2.0 mg of EYLEA® every two months after
an initial phase of monthly injections. In the third arm, the comparator arm,
patients will be treated with macular laser photocoagulation. The primary
endpoint of the study is mean change in visual acuity from baseline as measured
by the ETDRS eye chart. All patients will be followed for three years. We are
conducting one of these studies, called VISTA-DME (VEGF Trap-Eye:
Investigation of Safety, Treatment effect, and Anatomic outcomes in DME), with study centers in
the United States. Bayer HealthCare is conducting the second study, named
VIVID-DME (VEGF Trap-Eye In Vision Impairment Due to DME), with study centers in Europe, Japan, and Australia. The
VISTA-DME trial was fully enrolled in early 2012. 
    
In the first quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated a Phase 3
trial in Asia in collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI)
investigating the efficacy and safety of EYLEA® in patients with CNV
of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia. The study, which will enroll
approximately 110 patients, has started in Japan and is scheduled to run until
June 2013. 
    
In the first quarter of 2012, we plan to initiate a multinational study
of EYLEA® in patients with BRVO (VIBRANT).
Collaboration with Bayer HealthCare

    
In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement
with Bayer HealthCare for the global development and commercialization outside
the United States of EYLEA®. Under the agreement, we and Bayer
HealthCare collaborate on, and share the costs of, the development of
EYLEA® through an integrated global plan. Bayer HealthCare will
market EYLEA® outside the United States, where the companies will
share equally in profits from any future sales of EYLEA®. Commencing
on the first commercial sale of EYLEA® in a major market country
outside the United States, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare
for 50% of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from
our share of the collaboration profits. The reimbursement payment in any quarter
will equal 5% of the then outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than
our share of the collaboration profits in the quarter unless we elect to
reimburse Bayer HealthCare at a faster rate. Within the United States, we retain
exclusive commercialization rights to EYLEA® and are entitled to all
profits from any such sales. We have received $60 million in development
milestone payments and can earn up to $50 million in future milestone payments
related to marketing approvals of EYLEA® in major market countries
outside the United States. We can also earn up to $135 million in sales
milestone payments if total annual sales of EYLEA® outside the United
States achieve certain specified levels starting at $200 million.
2. ZALTRAP®
(aflibercept) also known as VEGF Trap  Oncology 
    
ZALTRAP® (aflibercept) is a fusion protein that is designed to
bind all forms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF, and prevent their interaction with
cell surface receptors. VEGF-A (and to a lesser degree, PlGF) is required for
the growth of new blood vessels (a process known as angiogenesis) that are
needed for tumors to grow.
    
ZALTRAP® is being developed globally in cancer indications in
collaboration with Sanofi. In April 2011, we and Sanofi announced that the Phase
3 VELOUR trial evaluating ZALTRAP® in combination with the FOLFIRI
chemotherapy regimen [folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan]
versus a regimen of FOLFIRI plus placebo met its primary endpoint of improving
overall survival (OS) in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
patients. The VELOUR data were presented in June 2011 at the European Society of
Medical Oncology World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer. In this study, the
addition of ZALTRAP® to the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen
significantly improved both overall survival (HR=0.817; p=0.0032) and
progression-free survival (HR=0.758; p=0.00007) compared to FOLFIRI plus
placebo. A similar effect was seen with ZALTRAP® therapy whether or
not patients had received prior bevacizumab therapy.
    
In the VELOUR study, grade 3 or 4 adverse events that occurred with a
more than two percent greater incidence in the ZALTRAP® arm than in
the placebo arm included diarrhea, asthenia/fatigue, stomatitis/ulceration,
infections, hypertension, GI/abdominal pains, neutropenia, neutropenic
complications and proteinuria. Deaths on study treatment due to adverse events
occurred in 2.4 percent of patients in the ZALTRAP® arm and in 1.0
percent of patients in the placebo arm. 
6


     Based upon
these positive findings, Sanofi submitted regulatory applications for marketing
approval of ZALTRAP® for the treatment of previously-treated mCRC
patients to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2011, and to the FDA
in early February 2012.
    
Another randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (VENICE), which is fully
enrolled, is evaluating ZALTRAP® as a first-line treatment for
hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer in combination with
docetaxel/prednisone. The VENICE trial is being monitored by an Independent Data
Monitoring Committee (IDMC), a body of independent clinical and statistical
experts. The IDMCs meet periodically to evaluate data from the trial and may
recommend changes in study design or study discontinuation. In July 2011, the
studys IDMC met for a scheduled interim analysis and recommended that the trial
continue to completion. A final analysis will be conducted when a pre-specified
number of events have occurred in this trial, which is anticipated in the second
quarter of 2012.
    
In December 2011, we announced initial data from the Phase 2 AFFIRM study
in the first-line mCRC setting of ZALTRAP® in combination with the
modified FOLFOX6 [folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin]
chemotherapy regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the Progression Free
Survival (PFS) rate at one year. The results showed that in patients who
received ZALTRAP®, the PFS rate at one year was similar to that seen
in the standard therapy arm for patients who received modified FOLFOX6 alone.
The study was not designed for a direct statistical comparison between arms. The
control arm was used as an internal benchmark only. The side effect profile of
ZALTRAP® was similar to what has been seen in prior trials with
ZALTRAP®.
ZALTRAP® Collaboration with Sanofi 
    
We and Sanofi globally collaborate on the development and
commercialization of ZALTRAP®. Under the terms of our September 2003
collaboration agreement, as amended, we and Sanofi will share co-promotion
rights and profits on sales, if any, of ZALTRAP® outside of Japan for
disease indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to
a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of ZALTRAP®, subject
to certain potential adjustments. We may also receive up to $400 million in
milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up
to $360 million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight
ZALTRAP® oncology and other indications in the United States or the
European Union and up to $40 million related to the receipt of marketing
approvals for up to five oncology indications in Japan. 
    
Under the ZALTRAP® collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed
upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement will be funded by Sanofi. If the collaboration becomes
profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi out of our share of
ZALTRAP® profits for 50% of the development expenses that they
funded. The reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal 5% of the then
outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than our share of the
ZALTRAP® profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse Sanofi
at a faster rate. 
3.
ARCALYST®
(rilonacept)  Inflammatory
Diseases
    
ARCALYST® is being developed for the prevention of gout flares
in patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy. Gout, a disease in which IL-1
may play an important role in pain and inflammation, is a very painful and
common form of arthritis that results from high levels of uric acid, a bodily
waste product normally excreted by the kidneys. The elevated uric acid can lead
to formation of urate crystals in the joints of the toes, ankles, knees, wrists,
fingers, and elbows. Uric acid-lowering therapy, most commonly allopurinol, is
prescribed to eliminate the urate crystals and prevent them from reforming.
Paradoxically, the initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy often triggers an
increase in the frequency of gout attacks in the first several months of
treatment, which may lead to discontinuation of therapy. The break-up of urate
crystals can result in stimulation of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1,
resulting in acute flares of joint pain and inflammation. These painful flares
generally persist for at least five days. 
     We
conducted a Phase 3 clinical development program with ARCALYST® in gout patients initiating uric acid-lowering
therapy. The program consisted of three studies: PRE-SURGE 1 (PREvention Study against URate-lowering drug-induced
Gout Exacerbations), PRE-SURGE 2, and RE-SURGE (REview of Safety Utilizing Rilonacept
in Gout Exacerbations). 
    
In June 2010, we announced that results from PRE-SURGE 1, a North
America-based double-blind, placebo-controlled study, showed that
ARCALYST® prevented gout attacks, as measured by the primary study
endpoint of the number of gout flares per patient over the 16 week treatment
period. In addition, all secondary endpoints of the study were positive
(p<0.001 vs. placebo). Among these endpoints, treatment with
ARCALYST® reduced the proportion of patients who experienced two or
more flares during the study period by up to 88%. Treatment with
ARCALYST® also reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at
least one gout flare during the study period by up to 65%. 
7


     In February
2011, we reported the results of PRE-SURGE 2 and RE-SURGE. In the PRE-SURGE 2
efficacy study in gout patients initiating allopurinol therapy, which was
identical to PRE-SURGE 1 in design and analysis, 248 patients were randomized.
ARCALYST® met the primary and all secondary study endpoints. The
primary endpoint was the number of gout flares per patient over the 16-week
treatment period. Patients who received ARCALYST® at a weekly,
self-administered, subcutaneous dose of either 160 mg or 80 mg had a 72%
decrease in mean number of gout flares compared to the placebo group
(p<0.0001). Among secondary endpoints, treatment with ARCALYST®
reduced the proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares during the
study period by up to 82%. In addition, treatment with ARCALYST®
reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one gout flare
during the study period by up to 63%.
    
We also announced that in the RE-SURGE study, which evaluated the safety
of ARCALYST® versus placebo over 16 weeks, ARCALYST® was
generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with that
reported in the PRE-SURGE 1 and PRE-SURGE 2 studies. In the overall gout
program, the most frequently reported adverse events were injection site
reaction and headache.
    
In the RE-SURGE study, ARCALYST® also met all secondary
endpoints, which evaluated efficacy, over the 16 week treatment period
(p<0.0001). These included the number of gout flares per patient, the
proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares, and the proportion of
patients who experienced at least one gout flare during the study period.

    
Based on the results of the three Phase 3 studies, we submitted a
supplemental BLA for U.S. regulatory approval of ARCALYST® for the
prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy. In
November 2011, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental BLA. Under PDUFA, we
were granted a target date for an FDA decision on the ARCALYST®
supplemental BLA of July 30, 2012.
    
We also initiated a long-term safety study in this setting, known as
UPSURGE (Understanding long-term safety in a Preventative Study against
URate-lowering drug-induced Gout Exacerbations), during the fourth
quarter of 2011.
    
We own worldwide rights to ARCALYST®.
4. Sarilumab (REGN88; IL-6R
Antibody) for inflammatory diseases 
    
IL-6 is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
arthritis, causing inflammation and joint destruction. A therapeutic antibody to
IL-6R, Actemra® (tocilizumab), a registered trademark of Chugai
Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha, has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis.
    
Sarilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-6R generated using
our VelocImmune® technology. In July 2011,
we and Sanofi announced that in the Phase 2b stage of the MOBILITY trial in
rheumatoid arthritis, patients treated with sarilumab in combination with a
standard RA treatment, methotrexate (MTX), achieved a significant and clinically
meaningful improvement in signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe RA compared
to patients treated with MTX alone. The Phase 2b stage of the MOBILITY study was
a 306-patient, dose-ranging, multi-national, randomized, multi-arm,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, that compared five different dose
regimens of sarilumab in combination with MTX to placebo plus MTX. The primary
endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 20%
improvement in RA symptoms (ACR20) after 12 weeks. 
    
In the Phase 2b stage of the MOBILITY trial, there was a dose response
observed in patients receiving sarilumab in combination with MTX. An ACR20
response after 12 weeks was seen in 49.0% of patients receiving the lowest
sarilumab dose regimen and 72.0% of patients receiving the highest dose regimen
compared to 46.2% of patients receiving placebo and MTX (p=0.02, corrected for
multiplicity, for the highest sarilumab dose regimen). The most common adverse
events (>5%) reported more frequently in active treatment arms included
infections (non-serious), neutropenia, and liver function test abnormalities.
The types and frequencies of adverse events were consistent with those
previously reported with IL-6 inhibition. The incidence of serious adverse
events among the five sarilumab treatment groups and the placebo group was
comparable. 
    
Sarilumab also demonstrated significant benefit compared to placebo in
secondary endpoints, including ACR 50, ACR 70, and Disease Activity Score (DAS)
28 scores, additional measures of clinical activity used in RA
trials.
    
In July 2011, we and Sanofi announced that in the phase 2b ALIGN trial in
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), sarilumab did not demonstrate significant
improvements in the signs and symptoms of active AS compared to placebo in
patients who had inadequate response to Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
(NSAIDs). Sarilumab was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events
reported more frequently in active treatment arms included infections and
neutropenia. 
8


     During the
third quarter of 2011, we and Sanofi initiated the Phase 3 stage of the Phase
2/3 MOBILITY study.
5. REGN727 (PCSK9 Antibody) for
LDL cholesterol reduction 
    
Elevated LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) level is a validated risk
factor leading to cardiovascular disease. Statins are a class of drugs that
lower LDL cholesterol by upregulating the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLR),
which removes LDL from circulation. PCSK9 is a naturally occurring secreted
protein that also modulates LDL cholesterol levels through its interaction with
the LDL receptor. In a landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2006, patients with lower than normal PCSK9 levels due to a
genetic abnormality not only had significantly lower levels of LDL cholesterol,
but also a significant reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. We used
our VelocImmune® technology to generate a
fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of PCSK9, called REGN727, that is
intended to lower LDL cholesterol.
    
In May 2010, we announced that in an interim efficacy analysis of a
dose-escalating, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial in
healthy volunteers, REGN727 achieved substantial, dose dependent decreases of
LDL cholesterol. Each dosing cohort consisted of six treated and two placebo
patients. In July 2010, we presented additional data from this Phase 1 program.
At the highest intravenous dose tested, a single dose of REGN727 achieved a
greater than 60% maximum mean reduction of LDL cholesterol from baseline that
lasted for more than one month. At the highest subcutaneous dose tested, a
single dose of REGN727 achieved a greater than 60% maximum mean reduction of LDL
cholesterol from baseline that lasted for more than two weeks. In these early
trials, REGN727 was generally safe and well tolerated with no trend in
drug-related adverse events and no evidence of hepato- or myo-toxicity.
Injection site reactions were minimal.
    
In July 2010, we also presented the results of an interim efficacy
analysis of a dose escalating, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase 1 trial of subcutaneously delivered REGN727 in hyperlipidemic patients
(familial hypercholesterolemia and non-familial hypercholesterolemia) on stable
doses of statins whose LDL levels were greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter
(mg/dL). At the highest dose tested at that time, in eleven patients, a single
dose of REGN727 achieved an approximately 40% maximum mean additional reduction
of LDL cholesterol from baseline. No serious adverse events and no dose limiting
toxicities were reported.
    
During 2011, three Phase 2 studies with subcutaneous regimens of REGN727
were initiated: (1) a randomized, double-blind, multi-dose, placebo controlled,
75-patient trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
(heFH), (2) a randomized, double-blind, multi-dose, placebo controlled,
90-patient trial in combination with atorvastatin in patients with primary
hypercholesterolemia, and (3) a randomized, double-blind, multi-dose, placebo
controlled, 180-patient trial in combination with atorvastatin in patients with
primary hypercholesterolemia and on stable doses of atorvastatin. The primary
endpoint of each Phase 2 study is the change in LDL cholesterol from baseline
compared to placebo over the study period.
    
In November 2011, we announced preliminary results from the Phase 2 heFH
trial. The objective of the study was to compare the effect of adding REGN727 to
the existing lipid lowering therapy in heFH patients. In the primary efficacy
analysis of the study, after 12 weeks of treatment, patients who received
different dosing regimens of REGN727 achieved mean LDL cholesterol reductions
from baseline ranging from approximately 30% to greater than 65%, depending on
the dosing regimen of REGN727, compared to a mean reduction of 10% with placebo
(p<0.05 for all dose groups). Patients in the study are being followed for a
total of 20 weeks for safety. In this trial, REGN727 was generally well
tolerated over 12 weeks. There were no elevations in liver function tests
greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and no cases of
elevated creatine phosphokinase reported. The most common adverse event was
injection site reaction and there were no serious adverse events on active
treatment. Full safety data from the 8-week post-treatment monitoring period
will be presented at a future medical congress upon final analysis. 
    
In November 2011, we also announced preliminary results from the Phase 2
trial studying patients with primary hypercholesterolemia who were on stable
doses of atorvastatin. The primary objective of the study was to compare the
effect of switching to a high dose of atorvastatin alone (80mg) versus a high
dose of atorvastatin combined with REGN727. In the primary endpoint of the
study, after eight weeks of treatment, patients who received REGN727 plus
atorvastatin 80mg achieved a greater than 65% reduction in mean LDL cholesterol
compared to a mean reduction of 17% for atorvastatin 80mg alone (p<0.001).
The study also included a third arm in which REGN727 was added to the stable low
dose of atorvastatin and the patients achieved a greater than 65% reduction in
mean LDL cholesterol. Patients in the study were followed for a total of 16
weeks for safety. In this trial, REGN727 was generally well tolerated over 16
weeks. There was one serious adverse event of dehydration in the REGN727 plus
atorvastatin 80mg group that was deemed not treatment related. One patient in
the REGN727 plus atorvastatin 80mg group with mildly elevated aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) prior to randomization (>ULN and </= 3ULN)
experienced an elevation of AST>3ULN and </=5ULN and one patient
discontinued therapy due to a hypersensitivity reaction (rash). 
9


     Initial data
from the third Phase 2 trial, studying subcutaneous regimens of REGN727 in
combination with atorvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, are
expected to be available in the first half of 2012.
    
REGN727 is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi. 
6. REGN668 (IL-4R Antibody) for
allergic and immune conditions 
    
IL-4R is required for signaling by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Both of
these cytokines are critical mediators of immune response, which, in turn,
drives the formation of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and the development of
allergic responses, as well as the atopic state that underlies asthma and atopic
dermatitis.
    
REGN668 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using
our VelocImmune® technology that is
designed to bind to IL-4R. REGN668 is in a Phase 1b study in patients with
atopic dermatitis and a Phase 2 study in eosinophilic asthma. REGN668 is being
developed in collaboration with Sanofi. 
7. REGN421 (Dll4 Antibody) for
advanced malignancies 
    
In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating blood
vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of
damaged and leaky vessels. VEGF was the first growth factor shown to be specific
for blood vessels, by virtue of having its receptor primarily expressed on blood
vessel cells. In the December 21, 2006 issue of the journal Nature, we reported data
from a preclinical study demonstrating that blocking an important cell signaling
molecule, known as Dll4, inhibited the growth of experimental tumors by
interfering with their ability to produce a functional blood supply. The
inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a variety of tumor types, including those
that were resistant to blockade of VEGF, suggesting a novel anti-angiogenesis
therapeutic approach. Moreover, inhibition of tumor growth is enhanced by the
combination of Dll4 and VEGF blockade in many preclinical tumor
models.
    
REGN421 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to Dll4 generated using our
VelocImmune® technology, and is in
Phase 1 clinical development. REGN421 is being developed in collaboration with
Sanofi. 
8. REGN910 (ANG2 Antibody) for
oncology 
    
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we initiated a Phase 1 study in an
oncology setting of REGN910, an antibody that specifically blocks ANG2. The
angiopoietins, which were discovered at Regeneron, are ligands for the
endothelial cell receptor Tie2 and are essential for vascular development and
angiogenesis. Unlike other family members, ANG2 is strongly upregulated by
endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, including
tumors.
    
REGN910 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our
VelocImmune® technology, which is
being developed for cancer indications. REGN910 is being developed in
collaboration with Sanofi. 
9. REGN475 (NGF Antibody) for
pain 
    
REGN475 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to NGF, generated using our
VelocImmune® technology, which is
designed to block pain sensitization in neurons. Preclinical experiments
indicate that REGN475 specifically binds to and blocks NGF activity and does not
bind to or block cell signaling for closely related neurotrophins such as NT-3,
NT-4, or BDNF.
    
In May 2010, we announced positive results from an interim analysis of a
randomized, double-blind, four-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in 217
patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. In July 2010, we presented additional
results from this trial through 16 weeks.
    
In December 2010, we were informed by the FDA that a case confirmed as
avascular necrosis of a joint was seen in another companys anti-NGF program.
The FDA believes this case, which follows previously-reported cases of joint
replacements in patients on an anti-NGF drug candidate being developed by
another pharmaceutical company, provides evidence to suggest a class-effect and
has placed REGN475, along with the two other anti-NGF antibodies in development
by competitors, on clinical hold. An FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee meeting is
scheduled for March 12, 2012 to discuss possible safety issues related to
anti-NGF compounds. There are currently no ongoing trials with REGN475.
    
In February 2012, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development of REGN475, and Regeneron now has sole global rights to REGN475. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi remains obligated to fund agreed-upon REGN475 development costs through the end of 2012 and is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN475.
10


10. REGN728 
     In the fourth
quarter of 2010, clinical trials began with REGN728, a fully human monoclonal
antibody generated using our VelocImmune® technology, against an
undisclosed target. REGN728 is being developed in collaboration with
Sanofi.
11. REGN1033
    
In December 2011, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug (IND)
filing for REGN1033 and in January 2012, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study.
REGN1033 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our
VelocImmune® technology, against an
undisclosed target. REGN1033 is being developed in collaboration with
Sanofi.
12. REGN846 
    
REGN846 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our
VelocImmune® technology, against an
undisclosed target, and is being evaluated in a Phase 2a study in patients with
atopic dermatitis. In July 2011, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development
of REGN846, and Regeneron now has sole global rights to REGN846. Under the terms
of our agreement, Sanofi remains obligated to fund REGN846 clinical costs
through conclusion of a planned proof-of-concept trial and is entitled to
receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN846.
13. REGN1154 
     REGN1154 is a fully human
monoclonal antibody generated using our VelocImmune® technology, against an
undisclosed target. In December 2011, we submitted a Phase 1 clinical trial
protocol in Australia for REGN1154 under the clinical trial notification (CTN)
regulatory process. We plan to initiate human studies in the first quarter of
2012 in Australia. Sanofi decided not to opt-in to the REGN1154 program and we
have sole global rights. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to
receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN1154.
Research and Development
Technologies: 
    
Many proteins that are either on the surface of or secreted by cells play
important roles in biology and disease. One way that a cell communicates with
other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into
the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions and are classified into
different families of molecules, such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and
cytokines. All of these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are
recognized by another set of proteins, called receptors, which reside on the
surface of responding cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical
cellular and biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the
regulation of growth of particular cell types to inflammation mediated by white
blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be overactive and thus result in a
variety of diseases. In these disease settings, blocking the action of specific
secreted proteins can have clinical benefit. In other cases, proteins on the
cell-surface can mediate the interaction between cells, such as the processes
that give rise to inflammation and autoimmunity.
    
Our scientists have developed two different technologies to design
protein therapeutics to block the action of specific cell surface or secreted
proteins. The first technology, termed the Trap technology, was used to
generate our two approved products, ARCALYST® and EYLEA®,
as well as ZALTRAP®, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials. These novel
Traps are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components and the
constant region of an antibody molecule called the Fc region, resulting in
high affinity product candidates. VelociSuiteTM is our second technology
platform; it is used for discovering, developing, and producing fully human
monoclonal antibodies that can address both secreted and cell-surface
targets.
VelociSuiteTM 
    
VelociSuiteTM consists of
VelocImmune®,
VelociGene®, VelociMouse®, and
VelociMab®. The VelocImmune® mouse platform is utilized to
produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. VelocImmune® was generated by exploiting
our VelociGene® technology (see
below), in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were
replaced, or humanized, with corresponding human immune gene loci.
VelocImmune® mice can be used to generate
efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic
interest. VelocImmune® and our entire
VelociSuiteTM offer the potential to
increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody
therapeutics may be discovered and validated, thereby improving the overall
efficiency of our early stage drug development activities. We are utilizing the
VelocImmune® technology to produce our next
generation of drug candidates for preclinical and clinical
development.
    
Our VelociGene® platform
allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of DNA to produce
highly customized alterations of a specified target gene, or genes, and
accelerates the production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without
using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In producing knock-out
models, a color or fluorescent marker may be substituted in place of the actual
gene sequence, allowing for high-resolution visualization of precisely where the
gene is active in the body during normal body functioning as well as in disease
processes. For the optimization of preclinical development and pharmacology
programs, VelociGene® offers the opportunity to
humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog. Thus,
VelociGene® allows scientists to rapidly
identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or over-expressing the
target gene, as well as to characterize and test potential therapeutic
molecules.
11


     Our
VelociMouse® technology platform
allows for the direct and immediate generation of genetically altered mice from
embryonic stem cells (ES cells), thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved
in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras. Mice generated through
this method are normal and healthy and exhibit a 100% germ-line transmission.
Furthermore, mice developed using our VelociMouse®
technology are suitable for direct
phenotyping or other studies. We have also developed our VelociMab® platform for the rapid screening of antibodies and rapid generation of
expression cell lines for our Traps and our VelocImmune® human monoclonal
antibodies.
Antibody Collaboration and License
Agreements 
     Sanofi.
In November 2007, we and Sanofi entered into
a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully
human monoclonal antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and
Preclinical Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. In
connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in 2007, we received a
non-refundable, up-front payment of $85.0 million from Sanofi. Pursuant to the
collaboration, Sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential
drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against
these targets. We lead the design and conduct of research activities under the
collaboration, including target identification and validation, antibody
development, research and preclinical activities through filing of an
Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or its equivalent, toxicology
studies, and manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies.
     For each drug
candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement,
Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license
agreement. If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with
us through product approval. Development costs for the drug candidate are shared
between the companies, with Sanofi generally funding these costs up front,
except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a
co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that
drug candidate are shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by us. We are generally
responsible for reimbursing Sanofi for half of the total development costs for
all collaboration antibody products from our share of profits from
commercialization of collaboration products to the extent they are sufficient
for this purpose. However, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our
share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards
reimbursing Sanofi for these development costs.
    
Sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed
under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products.
The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United
States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding
scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55%
(Sanofi)/45% (us), and will share losses outside the United States at 55%
(Sanofi)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up
to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing
after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a
rolling 12-month basis. 
    
In November 2009, we and Sanofi amended these agreements to expand and
extend our antibody collaboration. The goal of the expanded collaboration is to
advance a total of 20 to 30 new antibody product candidates into clinical
development from 2010 through 2017.
    
Under the amended discovery agreement, Sanofi agreed to fund up to $160
million per year of our antibody discovery activities over the period from
2010-2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to adjust the maximum
reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over
the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied. Sanofi has an
option to extend the discovery program for up to an additional three years after
2017 for further antibody development and preclinical activities. Pursuant to
the collaboration, Sanofi is also obligated to fund up to $30 million of
agreed-upon costs we incur to expand our manufacturing capacity at our
Rensselaer, New York facilities. 
    
In 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery
activities, Sanofi funded $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the
expanded collaboration. The balance between that amount and $160 million, or
$22.3 million, has been added to the funding otherwise available to us in
2011-2012 under the amended discovery agreement.
    
From the collaboration's inception in November 2007 through December 31,
2011, Sanofi has funded a total of $474.6 million of our costs under the
discovery agreement and a total of $400.4 million of our development costs under
the license agreement, or a total of $875.0 million in funding for our antibody
research and development activities during this period. 
12


     In August
2008, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi to use our VelociGene® platform to supply Sanofi
with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. Under
this agreement, Sanofi is required to pay us a minimum of $21.5 million for the
term of the agreement, which extends through December 2012, for knock-out and
transgenic models of gene function for target genes identified by Sanofi. Sanofi
will use these models for its internal research programs that are outside of the
scope of our antibody collaboration. 
    
Astellas Pharma Inc. In
March 2007, we entered into a six-year, non-exclusive license agreement with
Astellas Pharma Inc. to allow Astellas to utilize our VelocImmune® technology in its
internal research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the
terms of the agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable
payment to us in each of the second quarters of 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. In
July 2010, the license agreement with Astellas was amended and extended through
June 2023. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Astellas made a $165.0
million up-front payment to us in August 2010. In addition, Astellas will make a
$130.0 million second payment to us in June 2018 unless the license agreement
has been terminated prior to that date. Astellas has the right to terminate the
agreement at any time by providing 90 days advance written notice. Under
certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement,
Astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its
up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after June 2018, a portion of
its second payment, to us under the July 2010 amendment to the agreement. We are
entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
products discovered by Astellas using our VelocImmune® technology.
    
AstraZeneca UK Limited. In February 2007, we entered into a six-year, non-exclusive license
agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to allow AstraZeneca to utilize our
VelocImmune® technology in its
internal research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the
terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable
payment to us in each of the first quarters of 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. In
November 2010, as permitted by the agreement, MedImmune Limited (as successor by
novation from AstraZeneca) gave written notice of voluntary termination of the
agreement, effective in February 2011, thereby canceling its obligation to make
either of the final two annual payments. We remain entitled to receive a
mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by
MedImmune using our VelocImmune® technology. 
Royalty Agreement with Novartis
Pharma AG 
    
Under a June 2009 agreement with Novartis (that replaced a previous
collaboration and license agreement), we receive royalties on worldwide sales of
Novartis canakinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-IL1β antibody. The royalty
rates in the agreement start at 4% and reach 15% when annual sales exceed $1.5
billion. Canakinumab is marketed for the treatment of CAPS, has completed Phase
3 development for gout, and is in earlier stage development for atherosclerosis
and other inflammatory diseases. We are unable to predict whether canakinumab
will be approved for gout or any other indication in addition to CAPS, or
whether, even if approved, canakinumab for such indication(s) will be
successfully commercialized. Accordingly, we are unable to predict whether these
royalties will ever contribute materially to our results of operations or
financial condition. To date these royalties have been minimal.
National Institutes of Health
Grant 
    
In September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the NIHs Knockout Mouse Project. The goal
of the Knockout Mouse Project was to build a comprehensive and broadly available
resource of knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function and
human diseases. Under the NIH grant, as amended, amounts received or receivable
by us from the grants inception through December 31, 2011 totaled $25.1
million. No further funding will be received by us in connection with the NIH
Grant. 
Research Programs 
    
Our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and
angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and
disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain,
cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases.
Sales and Marketing 
    
We have a New Products Marketing and Planning group and a Market Research
group to evaluate commercial opportunities for our targets and drug candidates,
assess the competitive environment, and analyze the commercial potential of our
product portfolio. This group works in close collaboration with our
collaborators for co-developed products to develop marketing plans and forecasts
and to develop and execute pre-launch market development programs. 
13


     In connection
with the sales and marketing of ARCALYST® for CAPS, we have a small
marketing, trade, reimbursement, and distribution group to provide case
management and reimbursement services to patients with CAPS and their treating
physicians.
    
In preparation for the launch of EYLEA® for wet AMD in 2011,
we hired and trained a full-service commercialization group to execute the
launch of EYLEA®. The group includes experienced professionals in the
fields of marketing, communications, professional education, patient education
and advocacy, reimbursement and managed markets, trade and distribution,
commercial operations, commercial analytics, market research, and forecasting.
Moreover, we have hired, trained, and deployed a field-based organization of
approximately 75 individuals, including regional sales directors, medical sales
specialists, and reimbursement managers, each with 7+ years of experience in the
biopharmaceutical industry in a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology,
ophthalmology, immunology, and inflammation. We outsource the warehousing and
distribution of our finished drug products. 
Manufacturing 
     Our
manufacturing facilities are located in Rensselaer, New York and consist of three buildings totaling approximately 395,000 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. We currently have approximately 54,000 liters of cell
culture capacity at these facilities. At December 31, 2011, we employed 439 people at our Rensselaer facilities. There were no
impairment losses associated with long-lived assets at these facilities as of December 31, 2011. 
    
Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is
the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and
manufacturing procedures conform to the good manufacturing practice (GMP)
regulations of the health authority. In complying with standards set forth in
these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort
in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical
compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, are also
subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other
national, federal, state, and local agencies. We are approved to manufacture our
marketed products at our Rensselaer facilities. If our manufacturing facilities
fail to maintain compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we may
be required to suspend manufacturing. This would likely have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash
flows. 
Competition 
    
We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and
chemical companies (see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to
Commercialization of EYLEA® for the Treatment of Wet AMD and Risks
Related to Commercialization of Products). Our competitors include Genentech (a
member of the Roche group), Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Bayer HealthCare, Onyx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Abbott Laboratories, Sanofi, Merck
& Co., Inc., Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson &
Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, and others. Many of our competitors have substantially
greater research, preclinical, and clinical product development and
manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than
we do. Competition from smaller competitors may also be or become more
significant if those competitors acquire or discover patentable inventions, form
collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates, one or more of
our competitors may have brought a competitive product to market earlier than us
or may have obtained or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely
affects our activities or products. Our ability to compete will depend, to a
great extent, on how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates,
complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial
quantities of the product to the market. Competition among product candidates
approved for sale will also be based on efficacy, safety, reliability,
availability, price, patent position, and other factors.
    
EYLEA®. The market for eye
disease products is very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are collaborating
on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody fragment
(Lucentis®) for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, RVO, and other eye
indications. Lucentis® was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for the
treatment of wet AMD and in June 2010 for the treatment of macular edema
following retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Lucentis® was approved by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for wet AMD in January 2007, for the treatment
of DME in January 2011, and for the treatment of RVO in June 2011. Many other
companies, including Genentech, are working on the development of product
candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of wet AMD,
DME, and RVO including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as
well as use of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene
expression. For example, in January, 2012, Genentech submitted an IND for an
extended delivery device. In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label,
with success for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, and RVO, a third-party
repackaged version of Genentechs approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin®
(bevacizumab). The relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin®
in patients with wet AMD presents a significant competitive challenge in this
indication. The National Eye Institute (NEI) and others are conducting
long-term, controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis® to
Avastin® in the treatment of wet AMD. One-year data from the
Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) were
reported in April 2011 and indicated that Avastin® dosed monthly was
non-inferior to Lucentis® dosed monthly in the primary efficacy
endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. Avastin® is also
being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the United
Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and other areas. It may be
difficult for EYLEA® to compete in this or other eye indications for
which it may be approved against Lucentis® and off-label use of
Avastin® because doctors and patients have had significant experience
using these medicines and because of the relatively low cost of
Avastin®. Moreover, the recently reported results of the CATT study,
combined with the relatively low cost of Avastin® in treating
patients with wet AMD, may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which
EYLEA® will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be
approved. In addition, while we believe that ZALTRAP® would not be
well tolerated if administered directly to the eye, if ZALTRAP® is
approved for the treatment of certain cancers, there is a risk that third
parties will attempt to repackage ZALTRAP® for off-label use and sale
for the treatment of wet AMD and other diseases of the eye, which would present
a potential low-cost competitive threat to EYLEA® for wet AMD or
other eye indications.
14


     ARCALYST®. In 2009, Novartis
received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for canakinumab, a
fully human anti-interleukin-IL1ß antibody, for the treatment of CAPS. In January
2011, Novartis announced that it had submitted an application to the EMA for
approval of canakinumab in the treatment of gout flares. Novartis submitted a
supplemental BLA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2011 for approval of
canakinumab in gout, which was denied in August 2011 based upon safety concerns.
Canakinumab is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other
inflammatory diseases. In addition, there are
both small molecules and antibodies in development by other third parties that
are designed to block the synthesis of IL-1 or inhibit the signaling of IL-1.
For example, Xoma Ltd., in collaboration with Servier, is developing an antibody
to IL-1, and both Amgen and MedImmune are developing antibodies to the IL-1
receptor. These drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over
ARCALYST®. The successful development and/or commercialization of
these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of ARCALYST®
for CAPS and delay or impair our ability to commercialize ARCALYST®
for indications other than CAPS.
    
ZALTRAP®. Many companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed
to block the actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A variety
of approaches have been employed, including antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to
the VEGF receptor, small molecule antagonists to the VEGF receptor tyrosine
kinase, and other anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these alternative
approaches may offer competitive advantages to aflibercept in efficacy,
side-effect profile, durability of effect, or method of delivery. Additionally,
some of these molecules are already approved for marketing and have a broader
range of indications than our product candidate.
    
In particular, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
Avastin®, on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing VEGF
antagonists, including Novartis, Amgen, Imclone LLC/Eli Lilly, Pfizer,
AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline. Many of these molecules are further along in
development than ZALTRAP® and may offer competitive advantages over
our molecule. Pfizer, Onyx (together with its partner Bayer HealthCare), and
GlaxoSmithKline are selling and marketing oral medications that target tumor
cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of
tumors.
    
Monoclonal Antibodies. Our
clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies
which were generated using our VelocImmune® technology.
Our antibody generation technologies and clinical candidates face competition
from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various
technologies.
    
Numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products.
Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Biogen
Idec, Inc., Novartis, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squib, Abbott, and
GlaxoSmithKline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in
development or on the market that are derived from recombinant DNA that comprise
human antibody sequences. As noted above, Astellas has licensed our
VelocImmune® technology as part of their internal antibody development
programs.
    
We are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against
targets that are also the targets of our early-stage product candidates. For
example, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Abbott are developing antibody
product candidates against NGF. Genentech is marketing an antibody against IL-6R
(tocilizumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis, and several other companies, including Centocor Ortho
Biotech, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have antibodies against IL-6 in clinical
development for this disease. GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has a Dll4 antibody in clinical development for the
treatment of solid tumors. Aerovance has completed initial clinical trials of
two formulations of a biologic directed against IL-4. Amgen previously had an
antibody against IL-4R in clinical development for the treatment of asthma.
Amgen and Pfizer have development programs for antibodies against PCSK9; Alnylam
has a clinical program underway with an RNAi molecule against PCSK9. Amgen,
Pfizer, and AstraZeneca have development programs underway for antibodies
against ANG2. 
15


     Other
Areas. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to
discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time
and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights have
been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential
competitors of ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in
such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic competitors are
involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the
focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting. These
competitors include Amgen and Roche, as well as many others. Many firms and
entities are engaged in research and development in the areas of cytokines,
interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle conditions. Some of these competitors are
currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in
these areas. These and other competitors may have established substantial
intellectual property and other competitive advantages. 
    
If any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical
study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product
candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a
competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, or future
prospects. 
    
We also compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and
other public or private research organizations, which conduct research, seek
patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for the development
and marketing of products that would provide royalties or other consideration
for use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in
seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or
other consideration for use of the technology they have developed. Products
developed in this manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also
compete with others in acquiring technology from these institutions, agencies,
and organizations. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Trade
Secrets 
    
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain
trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary
rights of third parties (see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to
Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity  We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or
commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are
found to have infringed, third-party patents or other proprietary rights, and
the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely
continue to be significant.). Our policy is
to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements
that we consider important to our business and operations. As of December 31,
2011, we held an ownership interest in a total of approximately 186 issued
patents in the United States and approximately 570 issued patents in foreign
countries with respect to our products and technologies. In addition, we hold an
ownership interest in hundreds of patent applications in the United States and
foreign countries.
    
Our patent portfolio includes granted patents and pending patent
applications covering our VelociSuite technologies, including
our VelocImmune® mouse platform which
produces fully human monoclonal antibodies. Our issued patents covering these
technologies generally expire between 2020 and 2028. However, we continue to
file patent applications directed to improvements to these technology platforms.

    
Our patent portfolio also includes issued patents and pending
applications relating to our marketed products, ARCALYST® and
EYLEA®, and our product candidates in clinical development. These
patents cover the proteins and DNA encoding the proteins, manufacturing patents,
method of use patents, and pharmaceutical compositions, as well as various
methods of using the products. For each of ARCALYST®,
EYLEA® and our late-stage product candidate, ZALTRAP®, these patents
generally expire between 2020 and 2028. However, the projected patent terms may
be subject to extension based on potential patent term extensions in countries
where such extensions are available.
    
We also are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional patents
and patent applications. In December 2011, we and Genentech entered into a
Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic
sales of EYLEA® in the United States. Pursuant to this agreement, we
received a non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor
proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents. Under
the terms of the agreement, we agreed to make payments to Genentech based on
U.S. sales of EYLEA® commencing upon FDA approval of
EYLEA® in November 2011 through May 7, 2016. We will be required to
make a one-time, non-refundable $60 million payment upon cumulative U.S. sales
of EYLEA® reaching $400 million. In addition, we agreed to pay
royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® between $400
million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA®
over $3 billion.
    
In July 2008 we entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive
License Agreement with Cellectis S.A. pursuant to which we licensed certain
patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific
replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous
recombination. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to pay Cellectis a low,
single-digit royalty based on any future revenue received by us from any future
licenses or sales of our VelociGene® or
VelocImmune® products or services.
No royalties are payable to Cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of
antibodies from our VelocImmune® technology,
including antibodies developed under our collaboration with Sanofi. We also have
non-exclusive license agreements with Amgen and other organizations for patent
rights related to ARCALYST®. In connection with these licenses, we
pay a combined mid-single digit royalty on net sales of
ARCALYST®.
16


     Patent law
relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field is
evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. The
degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products in the United
States and other important commercial markets is uncertain and is dependent upon
the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, and
governments in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents
or others, if obtained, will provide us protection from competition or provide
commercial benefit.
    
Others may independently develop similar products or processes to those
developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
issued to us, design around any products and processes covered by our patents.
We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file product and process
applications with respect to our inventions. However, we may not file any such
applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of others.

    
Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights is expensive
and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that
patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court
may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that
we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay
licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties (see Item 1A.
Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity 
We may be restricted in our development,
manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by, and could be subject to
damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third-party patents or other
proprietary rights, and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have
been and will likely continue to be significant.). 
Government Regulation

    
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign
countries is a significant factor in the research, development, manufacture, and
marketing of ARCALYST®, EYLEA®, and our product candidates
(see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Commercialization of
EYLEA® for Wet AMD - Our regulatory
approval for sales of EYLEA® is limited to the
treatment of wet AMD and is limited to sales in the United States. If we don't
receive approval for EYLEA® for other indications, or if
approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries, our sales and profits
will be limited and Risks Related to the
Development and Approval of Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our
Marketed Products  If we do not obtain
regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our
marketed products, or maintain regulatory approval for
EYLEA® in the United States, we will not be able to market or sell them, which
would materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations, and
prospects.). All of our product candidates
will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and
clinical trials and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and
foreign authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the FDA and
foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent
years, and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions.
The ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be
predicted.
    
The activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the
United States begin with preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory
evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of
the product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be
submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before
proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically, clinical testing involves a
three-phase process. In Phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of
subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In
Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific
disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety,
tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the product
candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients
afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data
to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as
required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a
biologic product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA
for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for
commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval,
request additional information, or deny the application.
    
Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product candidates may
not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The designation of a clinical
trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a
trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and a
clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the
designation of the trial as being of a particular phase. The results of
preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term
safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in
humans.
17


     Approval of a
product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is
generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those
countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
additional testing, and the time required to obtain such approval may differ
from that required for FDA approval.
    
Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern
or influence the research, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record
keeping, marketing, transport, and other aspects of pharmaceutical product
candidates. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance
with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any
delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could adversely affect the
manufacturing or marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or
royalty revenue.
    
In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business will be
subject to regulation under the United States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air
Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions,
and other current and potential future local, state, federal, and foreign
regulations. 
Business Segments 
    
We manage our business as one segment which includes all activities
related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious
medical conditions and the development and commercialization of these
discoveries. This segment also includes revenues and expenses related to (i)
research and development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements
with third parties and our grant from the NIH, (ii) product sales, including
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD and ARCALYST® for the
treatment of CAPS, (iii) licensing agreements to utilize our VelocImmune®
technology, and (iv) the supply of specified, ordered research materials using
our VelociGene® technology platform.
Employees 
    
As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,704 full-time employees, of whom 330
held a Ph.D. and/or M.D., or PharmD degree. We believe that we have been
successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a highly
competitive environment; however, competition for these personnel is intense.
None of our personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and our
management considers its relations with our employees to be good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

     We
operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the following
risk factors, which have affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition. The risks described below include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our actual results may differ materially
from these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
immaterial may also impair our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should also be
considered by our investors. 
Risks Related to Our Financial
Results and Need for Additional Financing 
We have
had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability. If we
continue to incur operating losses, we may be unable to continue our operations.

    
From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31, 2011, we had a
cumulative loss of $1.3 billion. If we continue to incur operating losses and
fail to become a profitable company, we may be unable to continue our
operations. In the absence of substantial revenue from the sale of products,
including our current sales of EYLEA®, and ARCALYST® or
from other sources, the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be
predicted, our substantial losses will continue as we conduct our research and
development activities, commercialize our approved products, and prepare for
possible commercialization of our other product candidates and new indications
of our marketed products.
18


We may
need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and
which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development
programs or commercialization efforts. 
     We will need to expend substantial resources
for research and development, including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates and new indications of
our marketed products, continued commercialization of EYLEA® in the United States, to prepare for potential commercialization
of our late-stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products and, if one or more of those product candidates
or additional indications receive(s) regulatory approval, to fund the launch of those product(s) or new indications. We believe
our existing capital resources, together with funds generated by anticipated EYLEA® net product sales and funding
we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs; however,
one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate, our revenues may fall
short of our projections or be delayed, or our expenses may increase, which could result in our capital being consumed
significantly faster than anticipated. Our expenses may increase for many reasons,
including expenses in connection with the launch and marketing of EYLEA® and the potential commercial launches
of our late-stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, manufacturing scale-up, expenses related to
clinical trials testing ARCALYST®, EYLEA®, REGN475, REGN846,
or REGN1154, and expenses related to the potential requirement for us to fund 20% of Phase 3 clinical trial costs for any of our
antibody product candidates being developed in collaboration with Sanofi.
    
We may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able
to raise additional funds. If we are able to obtain additional financing through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, such sales will likely be
dilutive to our shareholders. Debt financing arrangements, if available given
the current uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets, may
require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict
our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be
at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our
shareholders. Should we require and be unable to (i) raise sufficient funds to
complete the development of our product candidates, (ii) to successfully
commercialize our late-stage product candidates or new indications for our
marketed products if they obtain regulatory approval, and (iii) to continue our
manufacturing and marketing of EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD,
we may face delay, reduction, or elimination of our research and development or
preclinical or clinical programs and our commercialization activities, which
would significantly limit our potential to generate revenue. We cannot be
certain how profitable, if at all, our current marketing of EYLEA®
for the treatment of wet AMD will be and, even if we obtain regulatory approval
for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, they
may never be successfully launched or become profitable, in which case our
business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be
materially harmed. 
The
value of our investment portfolio is influenced by varying economic and market
conditions and may experience losses.
    
As of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable
securities totaled $810.6 million (including $7.7 million of restricted cash and
marketable securities). We have invested our excess cash primarily in direct
obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities
guaranteed by the U.S. government, and money market funds that invest in U.S.
government securities. We consider assets classified as marketable securities to
be available-for-sale, as defined by FASB authoritative guidance. Unrestricted
and restricted marketable securities totaled $325.2 million at December 31,
2011, are carried at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are
included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as a separate
component of stockholders equity. If the decline in the value of a security in
our investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we write down the
security to its current fair value and recognize a loss which may be fully
charged against income. The current economic environment and the volatility of
securities markets increase the risk that we may not recover the principal we
invested and/or there may be further declines in the market value of securities
in our investment portfolio. As a result, we may incur additional charges
against income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments or
realized losses upon a securitys sale or maturity, and such amounts may be
material. 
Risks Related to the Development and
Approval of Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our Marketed Products

We
believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by
investors is based on the commercial potential of EYLEA®. If approval
for EYLEA® is not obtained in countries outside the United States, or
approval is not obtained for other indications, or if we fail to maintain
regulatory compliance and lose the marketing approval we have in the United
States, or if the product is withdrawn for any reason, our business, prospects,
operating results, and financial condition will be materially
harmed.
19


     Whether
EYLEA® is approved by regulatory authorities outside the United
States or approved by the FDA for new indications, and the timing thereof, will
depend on many factors, including the following:

whether or not the
  FDA determines that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials,
  other clinical trials and nonclinical studies of EYLEA®
  demonstrates that it is safe and effective as a treatment for the indication
  under review; and
whether or not the
  FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes, and controls
  for EYLEA® are adequate, that the labeling is satisfactory, and
  that plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring, and risk evaluation
  and management are sufficient;
     In June 2011,
Bayer HealthCare submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of
ELYEA® in wet AMD in the European Union and Japan. Analogous
regulatory authorities in these and other countries outside the United States
have similar discretion to the FDA as to approval of EYLEA® in those
countries.
     If
Bayer HealthCare does not obtain approval to market EYLEA® in the European Union, Japan, or other countries, or
if there are material delays in obtaining such approvals, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially harmed. 
If we do not obtain regulatory
approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed
products, or maintain regulatory approval for EYLEA® in the
United States, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would
materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations, and
prospects. 
    
We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval. If we do
not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates,
including ARCALYST® for the treatment of diseases other than CAPS,
EYLEA® for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases other than wet
AMD, and/or ZALTRAP® for one or more oncology indications, the value
of our company, our results of operations, and our prospects will be materially
harmed. Our product candidates, including ZALTRAP® for previously
treated mCRC, EYLEA® for CRVO and DME, and ARCALYST® for
the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy,
may not receive regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain such
approval(s), or if we are materially delayed in doing so, our business,
prospects, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially
harmed. In addition, if we fail to maintain regulatory approval for EYLEA®
for the treatment of wet AMD, we may lose marketing approval and the
ability to generate EYLEA® product sales revenue, which would
materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations,
and financial condition. 
Obtaining and maintaining
regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly
uncertain.
    
In the United States, we must obtain and maintain approval from the FDA
for each drug we intend to sell. Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy
and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments
also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is
likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly
uncertain.
    
The FDA enforces Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) and other regulations
through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical research organizations
(CROs), principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of the third
parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully
comply with GCPs, the study protocol or applicable regulations, the clinical
data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable. This could result in
non-approval of our product candidates by the FDA, or we or the FDA may decide
to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies, which would
delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs, and could
substantially harm our business. 
    
Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that
the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the
supply chain be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or
cGMP, requirements and regulations governing the shipment and storage of the
product. Manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory
requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
products must be manufactured for development, and following approval in
commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, and at
competitive costs. If we or any of our product collaborators, or third-party
manufacturers, product packagers, labelers, or other parties performing steps in
the supply chain are unable to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can
impose regulatory sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to approve a
pending application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a
pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, prospects, operating results,
and financial condition may be materially harmed. 
20


     In addition to
the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations in the United States, we are
subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical
trials, manufacturing, marketing and approval of drugs, and commercial sale and
distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign regulatory approval
process and requirements include all of the risks associated with FDA approval
as well as country specific regulations, and actions by a regulatory agency in a
country or region with respect to a product candidate may have an impact on the
approval process for that product candidate in another country or region.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product in the United States, we
must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities in
foreign countries before we can conduct clinical trials of or market that
product or any other product in those countries. 
Clinical trials required for our product candidates and new indications
of our marketed products are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is
highly uncertain. If any of our drug trials are delayed or yield unfavorable
results, regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of
our marketed products may be delayed or become unobtainable. 
    
As described above, we must conduct extensive testing of our product
candidates and new indications of our marketed products before we can obtain
regulatory approval to market and sell them. We need to conduct both preclinical
animal testing and human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials may not achieve
favorable results for many reasons, including, among others, failure of the
product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious
or life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with
exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in enrolling and maintaining
subjects in the clinical trial, lack of sufficient supplies of the product
candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial
monitors, contractors, consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial
plan, protocol, or applicable regulations related to GCPs. A clinical trial may
fail because it did not include and retain a sufficient number of patients to
detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A clinical
trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in
the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the
investigational drug in the disease setting. 
    
We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test
favorably and either conduct new trials, which are expensive and time consuming,
or abandon that drug development program. The failure of clinical trials to
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our clinical candidates for the
desired indication(s) would preclude the successful development of those
candidates for such indication(s), in which event our business, prospects,
operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed. 
Successful development of our current and future product candidates is
uncertain. 
    
Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately
result in commercially successful drugs. We are testing ZALTRAP® and
EYLEA® in a number of late-stage clinical trials in various
indications and ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in
patients initiating uric acid-lowering drug therapy. Clinical trials may not
demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the
requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates in these
indications. In a number of instances, we have terminated the development of
product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness. Moreover, even
if we obtain positive results from preclinical testing or clinical trials, we
may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many companies in the
biopharmaceutical industry, including our company, have suffered significant
setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results have been obtained in
earlier trials.
     In
April 2011 we announced that our Phase 3 VELOUR trial of ZALTRAP® met its primary endpoint of improving overall
survival in the treatment of patients with previously treated mCRC. Based upon these positive results, we and Sanofi submitted
regulatory applications for marketing approval to the FDA and EMA. In January 2012, Roche announced that a Phase 3 trial of Avastin®
(bevacizumab) had met the primary endpoint of overall survival in mCRC in patients who had previously received Avastin®
with standard chemotherapy. The positive results of this trial in a similar patient population could impact the potential
commercial opportunity for ZALTRAP® in mCRC. ZALTRAP® is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination
with a standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of first-line androgen independent prostate cancer. We do not have proof
of concept data from early-stage, double-blind, controlled clinical trials that ZALTRAP® will be safe or effective
in this cancer setting. In March 2010, Genentech announced that a Phase 3 trial of
Avastin®, in combination with chemotherapy in men with prostate
cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint. This trial had a very similar design to our ongoing Phase 3 trial of ZALTRAP®
in prostate cancer.
    
We also reported positive Phase 3 trial results with EYLEA® in
CRVO after six months of treatment and, based on these results, have submitted a
supplemental BLA filing to the FDA for marketing approval in the United States
of EYLEA® in CRVO. Under PDUFA, we were granted a target date for an
FDA decision on our EYLEA® in CRVO supplemental BLA of September 23,
2012. However, this expected timing for an FDA decision may not be met, and the
FDA may not grant such approval or such approval may be substantially delayed.
The FDA could also require us to provide additional clinical data in connection with this application. There can be no
assurance that we will receive regulatory approval for EYLEA® in
CRVO.
21


     We also
reported positive results of a Phase 2 trial of EYLEA® for the
treatment of DME and that we have initiated a Phase 3 program in that
indication. A number of other potential new drugs and biologics which showed
promising results in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials subsequently failed to
establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals, and this could occur with respect to subsequent clinical trials of
EYLEA® for the treatment of DME.
    
Based on the results of three Phase 3 studies, we have submitted a
supplemental BLA filing to the FDA seeking approval of ARCALYST® for
the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering drug
therapy and, under PDUFA, we were granted a target date for an FDA decision on
our ARCALYST® supplemental BLA of July 30, 2012. However, this
expected timing for an FDA decision may not be met, and the FDA may not grant
such approval or such approval may be substantially delayed. The FDA could also
require us to provide additional clinical data in connection with this
application. For example, in June 2011, following two positive Phase 3 trials,
the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA, voted to recommend against approval
in a gout indication for Ilaris® (canikinumab), Novartis IL-1
inhibitor which works through a similar mechanism as ARCALYST® and,
in August 2011, Novartis received a Complete Response letter from the FDA
requesting additional information, including clinical data to evaluate the
benefit-risk profile of Ilaris® in refractory patients. 
    
Many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of IDMCs.
These independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review
the progress of ongoing clinical trials, including available safety and efficacy
data, and make recommendations concerning a trials continuation, modification,
or termination based on interim, unblinded data. Any of our ongoing clinical
trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made by
responsible IDMCs based on their review of such interim trial results. For
example, in September 2009, a Phase 3 trial that was evaluating
ZALTRAP® as a first-line treatment for metastic pancreatic cancer in
combination with gemcitabine was discontinued at the recommendation of an IDMC
after a planned analysis of interim efficacy data determined that the trial
would not meet its efficacy endpoint. The recommended termination of any of our
ongoing late-stage clinical trials by an IDMC could negatively impact the future
development of our product candidate(s), and our business may be materially
harmed.
    
We are studying our antibody candidates in a wide variety of indications
in clinical trials. Many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to
evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and
uses, if any, are best suited for these product candidates. These product
candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to
support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being,
or are planned to be, studied, which would diminish our clinical pipeline and
could negatively affect our future prospects and the value of our company.

Serious
complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in
clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed
products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead
to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new
indications for our marketed products, which could severely harm our
business.
    
During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their
health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor.
Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being
studied caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts
have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product
candidates and new indications for our marketed products. It is possible that as
we test our drug candidates or new indications in larger, longer, and more
extensive clinical programs, or as use of these drugs becomes more widespread if
they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were
observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went
undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side
effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large
scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available
to patients after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any
of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products has many
side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development
of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or if the product candidate has
received regulatory approval such approval may be revoked, which would severely
harm our business. 
    
ZALTRAP® is being studied for the potential treatment of
certain types of cancer and EYLEA® is being studied in diseases of
the eye in addition to wet AMD. There are many potential safety concerns
associated with significant blockade of VEGF that may limit our ability to
successfully develop ZALTRAP® and EYLEA® in each of the
indications for which we are studying these product candidates. These serious
and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical
experience of VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation,
hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, and stroke.
In addition, patients given infusions of any protein, including
ZALTRAP® delivered through intravenous administration, may develop
severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF blockers
have reported side effects that became evident only after large scale trials or
after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. There are
risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like
EYLEA®, which can cause injury to the eye and
other complications. For example, in our Phase 3 trials of EYLEA® in
wet AMD, the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage,
macular degeneration, eye pain, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. These and other complications or side effects could harm the
development and/or commercialization of ZALTRAP® for the treatment of
cancer or EYLEA® for the treatment of diseases of the
eye.
22


     As more
patients begin to use ARCALYST® if it receives regulatory approval
for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering
therapy, and to the extent it is tested in new disease settings, new risks and
side effects associated with ARCALYST® may be discovered, and risks
previously viewed as inconsequential could be determined to be significant. Like
cytokine antagonists such as Ilaris® (canakinumab), a registered
trademark of Novartis, Kineret® (anakinra) and Enbrel®
(etanercept), registered trademarks of Amgen, and Remicade®
(infliximab) a registered trademark of Centocor Ortho Biotech, ARCALYST®
affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some of its
functions. Therefore, ARCALYST® may interfere with the bodys ability
to fight infections. As noted above, in June 2011, following two positive Phase
3 trials, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA voted to recommend against
approval in a gout indication for Ilaris®, Novartis IL-1 inhibitor
which works through a similar mechanism as ARCALYST® and, in August
2011, Novartis received a Complete Response letter from the FDA requesting
additional information, including clinical data to evaluate the benefit-risk
profile of Ilaris® in refractory patients. 
    
Treatment with Kineret®, a medication that works through the
inhibition of IL-1, has been associated with an increased risk of serious
infections, and serious, life threatening infections have been reported in
patients taking ARCALYST®. These or other complications or side
effects could cause regulatory authorities to revoke approvals of
ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS or deny the approval of
ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating
uric acid-lowering treatment or other disease settings. Alternatively, we may be
required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in the labeling of
our product, or limit or abandon our efforts to develop ARCALYST® in
new disease settings. Any such side effects may also result in a reduction, or
even the elimination, of sales of ARCALYST® in the current or future
approved indications. 
    
We are studying REGN475, a fully human monoclonal antibody to NGF, in a
variety of pain indications, including osteoarthritis of the knee. In December
2010, we were informed by the FDA that a case confirmed as avascular necrosis of
a joint was seen in another companys anti-NGF program. The FDA believes this
case, which follows previously-reported cases of joint replacements in patients
on an anti-NGF drug candidate being developed by another pharmaceutical company,
provides evidence to suggest a class-effect and placed REGN475 on clinical hold.
The FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee is scheduled for March 12, 2012 to discuss
possible safety issues related to anti-NGF compounds. There are currently no
ongoing trials with REGN475 that are either enrolling or treating
patients.
Our
product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an
immune response, resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies
against the therapeutic protein. 
    
In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory
hurdles faced by our product candidates, the administration of recombinant
proteins frequently causes an immune response, resulting in the creation of
antibodies against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or
can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher
doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can
cross react with the patients own proteins, resulting in an auto-immune type
disease. Whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from
preclinical or clinical experiments, and their detection or appearance is often
delayed, so neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date, in some
cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed.
We may
be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is
suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued
development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or
commercial sale, which could materially harm our business. 
    
If we are unable to continue to develop suitable product formulations or
manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product
candidates, including our antibody candidates, we may be unable to supply
necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would delay or prevent the
development of our product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable, directly or
through our collaborators or third parties, to supply sufficient quantities of
our products or develop formulations of our product candidates suitable for
commercial use, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for those
product candidates. 
Risks
Related to Commercialization of EYLEA® for the Treatment of Wet
AMD 
We are
subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect
to EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD. If we fail to maintain
regulatory compliance for EYLEA®, we may lose marketing
approval, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating
results, and financial condition. 
23


     EYLEA® is currently approved for treatment of wet AMD in the
United States and Bayer HealthCare is seeking approval in other countries. We
are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations with respect to
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD in the United States, and, if
approved outside the United States, commercialization of EYLEA® will
be subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight in those
countries where approval is obtained as well. If we fail to maintain regulatory
compliance for EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD, we may lose
marketing approval, which would materially harm our business, prospects,
operating results, and financial condition. Failure to comply may also subject
us to sanctions, product recalls, or withdrawals of previously approved
marketing applications. See also If we fail
to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture
of drug products or product candidates, we could incur substantial remedial
costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates and/or in
their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval, and a reduction in
sales. 
Serious
complications or side effects in connection with the use of
EYLEA® could
materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition. 
     There
are risks inherent in intravitreal injections, including with EYLEA®, such
as intraocular inflammation, sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, corneal decomposition, retinal detachment, retinal
tear, and other side effects, all of which are reported from time to time to the FDA. Serious complications or serious, unexpected
side effects in connection with the use of EYLEA® could materially
harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. 
Our
regulatory approval for sales of EYLEA® is limited to the
treatment of wet AMD and is limited to sales in the United States. If we don't
receive approval for EYLEA® for other indications, or if
approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries, sales and profits will
be limited.
    
We have received regulatory approval for sale of EYLEA® for
the treatment of wet AMD only in the United States. If we do not receive
approval for EYLEA® for other uses, or if approvals for sales in
other countries are not obtained, sales will be limited and our potential for
profits will be limited. As a result, our business, prospects, results of
operations, and financial condition would be materially impacted. 
Our
sales of EYLEA® for the treatment of
wet AMD are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third
party payers, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our sales
and potential revenue and harm our business, prospects, operating results, and
financial condition.
    
Our current sales in the United States of EYLEA® for the
treatment of wet AMD are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of
reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. If
approved for sale in other countries, such sales will be dependent, in part, on
similar programs in these countries. In the United States, there is an increased
focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various
regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased
pressure on federal programs to reduce costs, including limiting federal
healthcare expenditures. Economic pressure on state budgets may also have a
similar impact. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from
U.S. government programs could have a material adverse effect on the sales of
EYLEA®. Since EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD is too
expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if
adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, including Medicare
and Medicaid in the United States, is not available, our ability to successfully
commercialize EYLEA® will be materially adversely impacted. Our sales
and potential profits and our business, prospects, operating results, and
financial condition would be materially harmed. See also "The successful commercialization of EYLEA® for the
treatment of wet AMD as well as our late-stage product candidates or new
indications for our marketed products, if approved, will depend on obtaining
coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payers,
including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and these payers may not
agree to cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at
levels that make our products uncompetitive and/or unprofitable, which would
materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition."
    
The status of a J-code for EYLEA® could also affect
reimbursement. J-codes are permanent reimbursement codes maintained by Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that are a component of the Healthcare
Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), and are typically used to report
injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self-administered. We do not
currently have a J-Code for EYLEA®, although we anticipate assignment
of a J-Code for EYLEA® in January 2013. Without a unique J-code identifier,
EYLEA® must be billed using a non-specific miscellaneous J-code.
Since such codes may be used for a wide variety of products, health plans may
have more difficulty determining the actual product used and billed for the
patient. As a result, these claims must often be submitted with additional
information and manually processed, which can create delays in claims processing
times as well as increasing the likelihood for claim errors.
24


The
commercial success of EYLEA® currently being
marketed for the treatment of wet AMD is subject to strong competition.

     The market for
eye disease products is very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are
collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF
antibody fragment, Lucentis® for the treatment of wet AMD, CRVO, DME,
and other eye indications. Lucentis® was approved by the FDA in June
2006 for the treatment of wet AMD and in June 2010 for the treatment of macular
edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), CRVO, and branch retinal vein
occlusion (BRVO). Lucentis® was also approved by the EMA for wet AMD
in January 2007 and for DME in January 2011. Many other companies are working on
the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD and
DME including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as
small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. In
addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label, with success for the treatment
of wet AMD, DME, and RVO, third-party repackaged versions of Genentechs
approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin®. The relatively low cost of
therapy with Avastin® in patients with wet AMD presents a significant
competitive challenge in this indication. 
    
The National Eye Institute (NEI) and others are conducting long-term,
controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis® to Avastin®
in the treatment of wet AMD. One-year data from the CATT were reported in April
2011 and indicated that Avastin® dosed monthly was non-inferior to
Lucentis® dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean
visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. Avastin® is also being evaluated in
eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and other countries. It may be difficult for
EYLEA® in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved
to compete against Lucentis® and off-label use of Avastin®
because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these
medicines. Moreover, the recently reported results of the CATT study, combined
with the relatively low cost of Avastin® in treating patients with
wet AMD, may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which EYLEA®
will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved. In
addition, while we believe that ZALTRAP® would not be well tolerated
if administered directly to the eye, if ZALTRAP® is approved for the
treatment of certain cancers, there is a risk that third parties will attempt to
repackage ZALTRAP® for off-label use and sale for the treatment of
wet AMD and other diseases of the eye, which would present a potential low-cost
competitive threat to EYLEA® for wet AMD or other eye indications.
See also The commercial success of
EYLEA® currently being marketed for the treatment of wet AMD, and for our other
product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if any are
approved for marketing, is highly uncertain given their method of
administration, and because our competitors have received approval for and may
be marketing products with a similar mechanism of action or may enter the
marketplace with better or lower cost drugs.

Risks Related to Intellectual
Property and Market Exclusivity 
If we
cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are
insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive
position will be harmed. 
    
Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and
other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek to prevent improper
disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements. If our
trade secrets are improperly disclosed, by our own employees, our collaborators
or otherwise, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business.
We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third
parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable
patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
biotechnology companies, including our company, involves complex legal and
factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with
certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Patent
applications filed outside the United States may be challenged by third parties
who file an opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in
the European Union and are costly to defend. We have pending patent applications
in the European Patent Office and it is likely that we will need to defend
patent applications from third-party challengers from time to time in the
future. Patent applications filed in the United States may also be challenged by
third parties who file a request for post-grant review under the America Invents
Act of 2011, beginning on September 16, 2012. We expect that post-grant review
proceedings will become common in the United States and will be costly to
defend. We have pending patent applications in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent
applications from third-party challengers from time to time in the future. Our
patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive
advantages against competitors. Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to
us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely
expensive and time consuming. 
We may
be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization
activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have
infringed, third-party patents or other proprietary rights, and the costs and
expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be
significant. 
25


     Our commercial
success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the
patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Other parties may allege
that they have blocking patents to our products in clinical development or even
to products that have received regulatory approval and are being or have been
commercialized, either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the
composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or used. Moreover, other
parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody products made
using our VelocImmune® technology, either because of the way the
antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary composition
covering an antibody or the antibodys target. 
    
We are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by
Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. We do not believe that
ZALTRAP® or EYLEA® infringe any valid claim in these
patents or patent applications. We are involved in five patent litigations with
Genentech, two in the United States and three in Europe. In November 2010, we
commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the Court), seeking a declaratory judgment that
no activities relating to our VEGF Trap infringe any valid claim of certain
Genentech patents referred to as the Davis-Smyth patents (the First Davis-Smyth
Case). Genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our
prior or planned activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will
infringe claims of four of the five Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment
against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as
the Court deems appropriate.
     On
December 31, 2011, we entered into a non-exclusive license and partial settlement agreement (the Agreement) with Genentech
that covers making, using, and selling EYLEA® in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human eye
diseases and disorders in the United States. Under the Agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents,
and certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Agreement does not cover any non-U.S.
patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes, and does not cover any use of
aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First Davis-Smyth
Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Agreement. The Agreement provides for us to make payments to Genentech
based on U.S. sales of EYLEA® through May 7, 2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents expire. We will make a lump-sum
payment of $60 million once cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® reach $400 million. We will also pay royalties of
4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S. sales
of EYLEA® over $3 billion. As a result of the Agreement, on January 17, 2012 Genentech filed a second amended
answer and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of
the five Davis-Smyth patents. On December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a related case in the Court against Regeneron and Sanofi
alleging infringement of four of the five Davis-Smyth Patents by activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA®)
(the Second Davis-Smyth Case). As in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new complaint Genentech requests a judgment against us
for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.
    
We believe Genentech's claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the
Second Davis Smyth Case are without merit and intend to continue to defend
against all of Genentechs remaining claims vigorously. However, it is possible
that there could be an adverse determination or judgment in either or both cases
that would materially harm our business by requiring us to seek a license for
matters not covered by the Agreement, which may not be available at all or on
reasonable terms, or precluding the manufacture, further development, or sale of
EYLEA® outside the United States or ZALTRAP®, or resulting
in a damage award. In addition, irrespective of the outcome of the Davis-Smyth
cases, we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs and
expenses associated with them, which have negatively affected, and will likely
continue to negatively affect, our results of operations. An adverse
determination in any of the proceedings described herein may have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial
condition. 
    
We have initiated patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany,
the United Kingdom, and Italy, and may initiate other actions in other countries
outside the United States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes
that would materially harm our business and which, irrespective of the outcomes,
may also entail significant costs and expenses. 
    
We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by Roche that
claim antibodies to IL-6R and methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis with such
antibodies. We are developing sarilumab, an antibody to IL-6R, for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis. Although we do not believe that sarilumab infringes any
valid claim in these patents or patent applications, Roche could initiate a
lawsuit for patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover
sarilumab.
    
We are aware of a U.S. patent jointly owned by Genentech and City of Hope
relating to the production of recombinant antibodies in host cells. We currently
produce our antibody product candidates using recombinant antibodies from host
cells and may choose to produce additional antibody product candidates in this
manner. Neither ARCALYST®, ZALTRAP®, nor EYLEA®
are recombinant antibodies. If any of our antibody product candidates are
produced in a manner subject to valid claims in the Genentech patent, then we
may need to obtain a license from Genentech, should one be available. Genentech
has licensed this patent to several different companies under confidential
license agreements. If we desire a license for any of our antibody product
candidates and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms
or at all, we may be restricted in our ability to
use Genentechs techniques to make recombinant antibodies in or to import them
into the United States. 
26


     Further, we
are aware of a number of other third-party patent applications that, if granted
with claims as currently drafted, may cover our current or planned activities.
It could be determined that our products and/or actions in manufacturing or
selling our product candidates infringe such patents. 
    
Patent holders in addition to Genentech could assert claims against us
for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or developing
our drug candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued
patents of third parties. In the event that the manufacture, use, or sale of any
of our drug candidates, including EYLEA® or our other late-stage
product candidates, infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary
rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development,
manufacturing, and commercialization of those drugs and may be required to pay
costly damages. Such a result may materially harm our business, prospects,
operating results, and financial condition. In any event, legal disputes are
likely to be costly and time consuming to defend. 
    
We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment, such
licenses are needed or advisable. If any licenses are required, we may not be
able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The
failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or
commercializing any one or more of our product candidates, which could severely
harm our business. 
Loss or
limitation of patent rights, and new regulatory pathways for biosimilar
competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our
products.
    
In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an
innovative products commercial value is usually realized during the period in
which it has market exclusivity. In the United States and some other countries,
when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved
and marketed, there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the
products sales.
    
If our late-stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are
approved for marketing in the U.S or elsewhere, market exclusivity for those
products will generally be based upon patent rights and/or certain regulatory
forms of exclusivity. As described above under "If we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our
patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and
competitive position will be harmed", the
scope and enforceability of our patent rights may vary from country to country.
The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or
limitations on the use, or the loss, of such rights could be material to us.
Absent patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products, it is
possible, both in the United States and elsewhere, that generic and/or
biosimilar versions of those products may be approved and marketed which would
likely result in substantial and rapid reductions in revenues from sales of
those products. 
    
Under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA,
enacted in 2010, there is now a new, abbreviated path in the United States for
regulatory approval of biosimilar versions of biological products. The PPACA
provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for FDA approval of biologic drugs
that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of
less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. Under this new regulation,
an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after
approval of the innovator product. However, qualified innovative biological
products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA
may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative
biological product was first approved by the FDA. However, the term of
regulatory exclusivity may not remain at 12 years in the United States and could
be shortened. 
    
The increased likelihood of biosimilar competition has increased the risk
of loss of innovators market exclusivity. Due to this risk, and uncertainties
regarding patent protection, if our late-stage product candidates or other
clinical candidates are approved for marketing, it is not possible to predict
the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based
solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of
regulatory exclusivity. It is also not possible to predict changes in United
States regulatory law that might reduce biological product regulatory
exclusivity. The loss of market exclusivity for a product would likely
materially and negatively affect revenues from product sales of that product and
thus our financial results and condition. 
Risks Related to Manufacturing and
Supply 
We rely
on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity,
which could result in our being unable to continue to successfully commercialize
EYLEA® and to
commercialize our other product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they receive
regulatory approval and are unable to continue to develop our clinical
candidates. 
27


     Our
manufacturing facility would be inadequate to produce the active pharmaceutical
ingredients of (a) EYLEA®, ZALTRAP®, and
ARCALYST® for the treatment of gout flares in sufficient
commercial quantities if these late-stage product candidates were all to receive
regulatory approval, and (b) our earlier stage product candidates in sufficient
clinical quantities if our clinical pipeline advances as planned. In addition to
expanding our internal capacity, we intend to rely on our corporate
collaborators, as well as contract manufacturers, to produce commercial
quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products to the
extent such quantities are not manufactured at our own facility. We rely
entirely on third-parties and our collaborators for filling and finishing
services. Generally, in order for other parties to perform any step in the
manufacturing and supply chain, we must transfer technology to the other party
which can be time consuming and may not be successfully accomplished without
considerable cost and expense, or at all. We will have to depend on these other
parties to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory
requirements. If for any reason they are unable to do so, and as a result we are
unable to directly or through such third parties manufacture and supply
sufficient commercial quantities of our products on acceptable terms, or if we
should encounter delays or other difficulties in our relationships with our
corporate collaborators, third-party manufacturers, or other parties involved in
our supply chain which adversely affect the timely manufacture and supply of our
products, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition
may be materially harmed. 
Expanding our manufacturing capacity will be costly and we may be
unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the
launch and successful commercialization of our late-stage product candidates or
other indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing
and could jeopardize our current and future clinical development programs.

    
Expanding our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of
the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our late-stage product candidates if
they are approved for marketing, and to supply clinical drug material to support
the continued growth of our clinical programs, will require substantial
additional expenditures, and we will need to hire and train significant numbers
of employees and managerial personnel to staff our manufacturing and supply
chain operations. Start-up costs can be large and scale-up entails significant
risks related to process development and manufacturing yields. In addition, we
may face difficulties or delays in developing or acquiring the necessary
production equipment and technology to manufacture sufficient quantities of our
product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable
regulatory requirements. The FDA and analogous foreign regulatory authorities
must determine that our existing and any expanded manufacturing facilities
comply, or continue to comply, with cGMP requirements for both clinical and
commercial production and license them, or continue to license them,
accordingly, and such facilities must also comply with applicable environmental,
safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. We may not successfully
expand or establish sufficient manufacturing capabilities or manufacture our
products economically or in compliance with cGMPs and other regulatory
requirements, and we and our collaborators may not be able to build or procure
additional capacity in the required timeframe to meet commercial demand for our
late-stage product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, and to
continue to meet the requirements of our clinical programs. This would interfere
with our efforts to successfully commercialize EYLEA®,
ZALTRAP®, and ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares
in patients initiating uric acid-lowering treatment if they receive regulatory
approval, and could also delay or require us to discontinue one or more of our
clinical development programs. As a result, our business, prospects, operating
results, and financial condition could be materially harmed. 
Our
ability to manufacture our products may be impaired if any of our manufacturing
activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and
supply chain, are found to infringe third-party patents. 
    
Our ability to continue to manufacture ARCALYST®,
EYLEA®, and ZALTRAP® in our Rensselaer, New York
facilities, or to utilize third parties to produce our products or perform
fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends
on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents or other
intellectual property rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that our
manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our
manufacture and supply chain, infringe patents or other intellectual property
rights. A judicial decision in favor of one or more parties making such
allegations could preclude the manufacture of our products where those
intellectual property rights apply which could materially harm our business,
results of operations, and prospects.
If
sales of EYLEA® for the treatment of
wet AMD do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of our
late-stage product candidates or new indications of our marketed products, or
any of our clinical programs, are delayed or discontinued, we may face costs
related to unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities
of third parties. 
28


    
We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New York. We
use our facilities to produce bulk product of ARCALYST® for the
treatment of CAPS, bulk product of EYLEA® for the treatment of wet
AMD and clinical and preclinical candidates for
ourselves and our collaborations, and plan to use such facilities to produce
bulk product for commercial supply of our late-stage product candidates or new
indications of our marketed products if they are approved for marketing. If our
clinical candidates are discontinued or their clinical development is delayed,
if the launch of any of our late-stage product candidates or new indications or
our marketed products is delayed or does not occur, or if such products are
launched and subsequently recalled or marketing approval is rescinded, we may
have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies,
as well as similar costs of third-party contract manufacturers performing
services for us. 
Third-party service or supply failures, or other failures, business
interruptions, or natural disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in
Rensselaer, New York or the facilities of any other party participating in the
supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.

    
We manufacture all of our bulk drug materials at our manufacturing
facilities in Rensselaer, New York. We would be unable to manufacture these
materials if our Rensselaer facilities were to cease production due to
regulatory requirements or action, business interruptions, labor shortages or
disputes, contaminations, fire, natural disasters, or other problems at the
facilities. 
    
Also, certain raw materials necessary for the manufacture and formulation
of ARCALYST® and EYLEA® and of our product candidates,
including ZALTRAP®, are provided by single-source unaffiliated
third-party suppliers. In addition, we rely on certain third parties to perform
filling, finishing, distribution, laboratory testing, and other services related
to the manufacture of ARCALYST® and our product candidates. We would
be unable to obtain these raw materials or services for an indeterminate period
of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or
otherwise fail to supply these materials, products, or services to us for any
reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, adverse financial
developments at or affecting the supplier, failure by the supplier to comply
with cGMPs, business interruptions, or labor shortages or disputes. This, in
turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply
ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS and EYLEA® for the
treatment of wet AMD and to manufacture and supply commercial quantities of
EYLEA® for other ophthalmologic diseases, ZALTRAP®, and
ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares if they receive
regulatory approval, which could materially and adversely affect our business
and future prospects. 
    
Certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the
formulation of our product candidates may be derived from biological sources,
including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin. There are
certain European regulatory restrictions on using these biological source
materials. If we are required to substitute for these sources to comply with
European regulatory requirements, our clinical development activities may be
delayed or interrupted. 
If we
fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the
manufacture of drug products or product candidates, we could incur substantial
remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates
or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch
if they obtain regulatory approval, and a reduction in sales.
    
We and our third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with
cGMP, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other
jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Changes of suppliers or modifications
of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the FDA
or such comparable foreign agencies and acceptance of the change by the FDA or
such comparable foreign agencies prior to release of product(s). Because we
produce multiple product candidates at our facility in Rensselaer, New York,
including ARCALYST®, EYLEA®, and ZALTRAP®,
there are increased risks associated with cGMP compliance. Our inability, or the
inability of our third-party fill/finish or other service providers, to
demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and
expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall product, halt or interrupt
clinical trials, and/or interrupt commercial supply of any marketed products,
and could also delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for our
late-stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products. Any
delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish,
packaging, or storage of any drug product or product candidate as a result of a
failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to
pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cGMP compliance could
significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, and
successfully commercialize our products, which would substantially harm our
business and prospects. Any finding of non-compliance could also increase our
costs, cause us to delay the development of our product candidates, result in
delay in our obtaining, or our not obtaining, regulatory approval of product
candidates or new indications for our marketed products, and cause us to lose
revenue from any marketed products, which could be seriously detrimental to our
business, prospects, and financial condition.
29


Risks Related to Commercialization
of Products 
We may
be unsuccessful in continuing our commercialization of EYLEA® for the
treatment of wet AMD or commercializing our late stage product candidates or new
indications for our marketed products, if approved, which would materially delay
or prevent our achieving profitability. 
     Even if
clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product
candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are
obtained, the commercial success of any of our product candidates or new
indications for our marketed products will depend upon, among other things,
their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payers and
on our and our collaborators' ability to successfully manufacture and
commercialize those products or new indications. Even if we obtain regulatory
approval for our product candidates or new indications, if they are not
successfully commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant
investment we have made in developing such products and our business, prospects,
operating results, and financial condition would be severely harmed. 
    
In particular, we are in the early stages of commercialization and cannot
be sure that EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD will be commercially
successful in the pharmaceutical market. In addition to the challenges we face
related to a company launching its first major commercial drug, as described in
detail in the risk factor immediately below, we and Bayer HealthCare will face
intense competition from Lucentis® and from off-label use of
Avastin®, both of which have been on the market for a number of
years. We expect that the initial commercial success of EYLEA® for
the treatment of wet AMD will depend on many factors, including the following:


the effectiveness of our and Bayer HealthCare's
  commercial strategies for the launch and marketing of EYLEA® in and
  outside the United States, respectively, including pricing strategy and the
  effectiveness of efforts to obtain, and the timing of obtaining, adequate
  third-party reimbursements;
maintaining and successfully monitoring commercial
  manufacturing arrangements for EYLEA® with third parties who
  perform fill/finish or other steps in the manufacture of EYLEA® to
  ensure that they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities,
  including the FDA, which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical
  manufacturing facilities;
our ability to meet the demand for commercial
  supplies of EYLEA®;
our ability to effectively communicate to the
  marketplace the benefits of the dosing regimen of EYLEA® of every 2
  months after three initial monthly doses as compared to the monthly dosing
  regimen of Lucentis®, and the willingness of retinal specialists
  and patients to switch from Lucentis® or off-label use of
  Avastin® to EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD;
the ability of patients, retinal specialists, and
  other providers to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage and reimbursement
  from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States
  and other government and private payors in the United States and foreign
  jurisdictions; and
the effect of new health care legislation
  currently being implemented in the United States.
    
While we believe that EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD has
a commercially competitive profile, we cannot predict whether ophthalmologists,
particularly retinal specialists, and patients, will accept or utilize
EYLEA®. Our and Bayer HealthCare's efforts to educate the relevant
medical community and third-party payors regarding the benefits of
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD will require significant
resources and may not be successful in achieving our objectives. If
EYLEA® is approved for marketing but does not achieve significant
market acceptance for the treatment of wet AMD, our ability to achieve
profitability would be materially impaired or delayed.
If we are unable to establish, and
effectively deploy and manage, sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities in
the applicable markets or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will not generate our expected sales of EYLEA®
for treatment of wet AMD or successfully launch and commercialize our late-stage product candidates or new indications
for our marketed products if they receive regulatory approval, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating
results, and financial condition. 
    
We currently sell EYLEA® in the United States to three
distributors and several specialty pharmacies. We currently sell
ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS in the United States to two
specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, we enter into written
contracts with our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, our
customers), and our customers generally take physical delivery of product. For
EYLEA®, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the
product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST®, the
specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients.
30


     We have
established our own sales and marketing organization for EYLEA® in
the United States for the treatment of wet AMD, and in anticipation of filing
for and receiving regulatory approval to market and sell EYLEA® in
the United States for the treatment of CRVO. However, we may be unsuccessful in
achieving a successful commercialization of EYLEA® in the United
States, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results,
and financial condition.
    
We will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to
develop our own sales and marketing capabilities, and our distribution network,
for ARCALYST® for patients with gout initiating uric acid-lowering
drug therapy if it receives regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain
these capabilities, either by developing our own organizations or entering into
agreements with others to provide these functions, even if ARCALYST®
for the prevention of gout flares receives marketing approval, we will not be
able to successfully launch and commercialize this product, which would also
materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition.
    
We have limited experience in sales, marketing, or distribution of
products in substantial commercial quantities or in establishing and managing
the required infrastructure to do so, including large-scale information
technology systems and a large-scale distribution network, and we may be unable
to establish such infrastructure on a timely basis. To the extent we determine
to utilize third parties to provide sales, marketing, or distribution
capabilities for ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares or any
of our other product candidates or new indications for marketed products if they
receive regulatory approval, we may encounter difficulties in retaining such
parties on acceptable terms. Even if we hire qualified sales and marketing
personnel, and establish the required infrastructure we need to support our
objectives, or enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third
parties on acceptable terms, we may not do so in an efficient manner or on a
timely basis. We may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of
the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities
necessary to successfully market and sell in the United States
EYLEA®, ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares, or
any of our other product candidates or new indications if they receive
regulatory approval in the United States and as to which we retain sales and
marketing responsibility in that market. Establishing and maintaining sales,
marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Our
expenses associated with building up and maintaining a sales force and
distribution capabilities may be disproportional, particularly in the near term,
compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales in the United
States of EYLEA® or ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout
flares. Ultimately neither we nor our collaborators may be successful in
commercializing EYLEA®, ZALTRAP®, ARCALYST® for
the prevention of gout flares, or any of our other product
candidates.
    
Under the terms of our collaboration agreement, Sanofi has primary
responsibility for sales, marketing, and distribution of ZALTRAP® in
cancer indications, should it be approved in the future by regulatory
authorities for marketing.
     We
currently have no sales, marketing, commercial, or distribution capabilities outside the United States. Under the terms of our license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare, we will rely on Bayer HealthCare for
sales, marketing, and distribution of EYLEA® in countries outside the United States should it be approved for
marketing in such countries.
The
commercial success of EYLEA® currently being
marketed for the treatment of wet AMD, and for our other product candidates or
new indications for our marketed products, if any are approved for marketing, is
highly uncertain given their method of administration, and because our
competitors have received approval for and may be marketing products with a
similar mechanism of action or may enter the marketplace with better or lower
cost drugs. 
    
Our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by
intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are generally less well received
by patients than tablet or capsule delivery and this could adversely affect the
commercial success of those products if they receive marketing
approval.
    
There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries from biotechnology, pharmaceutical,  and chemical companies. Many of
our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical
product development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing,
and human resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also enhance their
competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form
collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
if we achieve commercialization of our product candidates, our competitors have
achieved, and may continue to achieve, product commercialization before our
products are approved for marketing and sale.
    
As previously noted, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
Avastin®, on the market for treating certain cancers and many
different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop
competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Amgen, Imclone LLC/Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline. Some of these molecules are
further along in development than ZALTRAP® and may offer competitive
advantages over our molecule. Each of Pfizer, Onyx
(together with its partner Bayer HealthCare), and GlaxoSmithKline are marketing
and selling oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature
formation that fuels the growth of tumors. The marketing approvals for
Genentechs VEGF antagonist, Avastin®, and their extensive, ongoing
clinical development plan for Avastin® in other cancer indications,
make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support
ZALTRAP® for those indications and to obtain regulatory approval of
ZALTRAP® in those indications. This may delay or impair our ability
to successfully develop and commercialize ZALTRAP® for various cancer
indications. In addition, even if ZALTRAP® is approved for sale for
the treatment of certain cancers, it will be difficult for our drug to compete
against Avastin® and the FDA approved kinase inhibitors, because
doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines. In
addition, an oral medication may be considerably less expensive for patients
than a biologic medication, providing a competitive advantage to companies that
market such products.
31


     The market for
eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are
collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF
antibody fragment, Lucentis® for the treatment of wet AMD, CRVO, DME,
and other eye indications. Lucentis® was approved by the FDA in June
2006 for the treatment of wet AMD and in June 2010 for the treatment of macular
edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), CRVO, and branch retinal vein
occlusion (BRVO). Lucentis® was also approved by the EMA for wet AMD
in January 2007 and for DME in January 2011. Many other companies are working on
the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD and
DME including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as
small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. In
addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label, with success for the treatment
of wet AMD, DME, and RVO, third-party repackaged versions of Genentechs
approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin®.
    
The National Eye Institute (NEI) and others are conducting long-term,
controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis® to Avastin®
in the treatment of wet AMD. One-year data from the Comparison of Age-Related
Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) were reported in April 2011 and
indicated that Avastin® dosed monthly was non-inferior to
Lucentis® dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean
visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. It may be difficult for EYLEA® in
this or other eye indications for which it may be approved to compete against
Lucentis® and off-label use of Avastin® because doctors
and patients have had significant experience using these medicines. Moreover,
the recently reported results of the CATT study, combined with the relatively
low cost of Avastin® in treating patients with wet AMD, may well
exacerbate the competitive challenge which EYLEA® will face in this
or other eye indications for which it may be approved. In addition, while we
believe that ZALTRAP® would not be well tolerated if administered
directly to the eye, if ZALTRAP® is approved for the treatment of
certain cancers, there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage
ZALTRAP® for off-label use and sale for the treatment of wet AMD and
other diseases of the eye, which would present a potential low-cost competitive
threat to EYLEA® for wet AMD or other eye indications. 
    
The availability of highly effective FDA approved Tumor Necrosis
Factors-antagonists (TNF-antagonists) such as Enbrel®,
Remicade®, Humira® (adalimumab), a registered trademark of
Abbott Laboratories, Simponi® (golimumab), a registered trademark of
Johnson & Johnson, the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret®,
Ilaris® (canakinumab), and other marketed therapies makes it more
difficult to successfully develop and commercialize ARCALYST® in
indications other than CAPS, and this is one of the reasons we discontinued the
development of ARCALYST® in adult rheumatoid arthritis. In addition,
even if ARCALYST® is ever approved for sale in indications where
TNF-antagonists are approved, it will be difficult for our drug to compete
against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists because doctors and patients have had
significant experience using these effective medicines. Moreover, in such
indications these approved therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over
ARCALYST®, such as requiring fewer injections.
    
There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other
companies that are designed to block the synthesis of IL-1 or inhibit the
signaling of IL-1. For example, Eli Lilly, Xoma (in collaboration with
Servier), and Novartis are each developing antibodies to IL-1 and both Amgen and
MedImmune are developing antibodies to the IL-1 receptor. In 2009, Novartis
received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for
Ilaris®, a fully human anti-interleukin-IL1ß antibody, for the
treatment of CAPS. Ilaris® is also in development for atherosclerosis
and a number of other inflammatory diseases. Novartis IL-1 antibody and these
other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over
ARCALYST®. For example, Ilaris® is dosed once every eight
weeks compared to the once-weekly dosing regimen for ARCALYST®. The
successful development and/or commercialization of these competing molecules
could adversely affect sales of ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS
and delay or impair our ability to commercialize ARCALYST® for
indications other than CAPS.
    
We are developing ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares
in patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy and have submitted a
supplemental BLA filing for U.S. regulatory approval in this indication. In
January 2011, Novartis announced that the results of two Phase 3 studies with
Ilaris® focused on reducing pain and preventing recurrent attacks or
flares in patients with hard-to-treat gout were positive. Novartis has also
reported that regulatory filings for the use of Ilaris® in gouty
arthritis have been completed in the European Union in 2010 and in the United
States in the first quarter of 2011, based on the results of these two Phase 3
studies. Ilaris® is dosed less frequently for the treatment of CAPS,
and if it is approved for the treatment of gout, it may be perceived by some
physicians as offering competitive advantages over ARCALYST®, which
would make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize
ARCALYST® in that disease.
32


     Currently,
inexpensive, oral therapies such as analgesics and other NSAIDS, are used as the
standard of care to treat the symptoms of gout diseases. These established,
inexpensive, orally delivered drugs may make it difficult for us to successfully
commercialize ARCALYST® in these diseases. 
    
Our earlier-stage clinical candidates in development are all fully human
monoclonal antibodies, which were generated using our VelocImmune® technology. Our antibody
generation technologies and earlier-stage clinical candidates face competition
from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various
technologies.
    
Numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products.
Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Biogen
Idec, Novartis, Genentech/Roche, Bristol-Myers Squib, Abbott, and
GlaxoSmithKline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in
development or on the market that are derived from recombinant DNA that comprise
human antibody sequences.
    
We are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against
targets that are also the targets of our early-stage product candidates. For
example, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Abbott are developing antibody
product candidates against NGF. Genentech/Roche is marketing an antibody against
IL-6R (tocilizumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and several other
companies, including Centocor/Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol-Myers Squibb,
have antibodies against IL-6 in clinical development for this disease.
GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, has a Dll4
antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. Aerovance
has two formulations of a biologic directed against IL-4 in clinical
development. Amgen previously had an antibody against IL-4R in clinical
development for the treatment of asthma. We believe that several companies,
including Amgen and Pfizer, have development programs for antibodies against
PCSK9. Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca have development programs underway for
antibodies against ANG2. If any of these or other competitors announces a
successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one
of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory
agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect
on our business or future prospects. 
The successful commercialization
of EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD as well as our late-stage product candidates or new indications
for our marketed products, if approved, will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party
payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and these payers may not agree to cover or adequately reimburse
for use of our products or may do so at levels that make our products uncompetitive and/or unprofitable, which would materially
harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
    
Our product candidates, if commercialized, may be significantly more
expensive than traditional drug treatments. For example, we are developing
ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating
uric acid-lowering drug therapy. Patients suffering from this gout indication
are currently treated with inexpensive therapies, including NSAIDS. These
existing treatment options are likely to be considerably less expensive and may
be preferable to a biologic medication for some patients. Our future revenues
and profitability will be adversely affected in a material manner if United
States and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payers, and
other third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to
defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities
do not provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or
provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be
too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe
them. Many third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are
not preferred by such payers more expensive for patients, and require prior
authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a
particular drug. In particular, payers may impose these obstacles to coverage on
higher-priced drugs, as our product candidates are likely to be.
    
Government and other third-party payers are challenging the prices
charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to
limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs. In March
2010, the PPACA and a related reconciliation bill were enacted in the United
States. This legislation imposes cost containment measures that are likely to
adversely affect the amount of reimbursement for our future products. The full
effects of this legislation are unknown at this time and will not be known until
regulations and guidance are issued by CMS and other federal and state agencies.
Further, in September 2011 the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the
Department of Health and Human Services issued a report entitled Review of
Medicare Part B Avastin and Lucentis Treatments for Age-Related Macular
Degeneration in which the OIG details possible savings to the Medicare program
by using off-label Avastin® rather than Lucentis® for the
treatment of wet AMD. Some states are also considering legislation that would
control the prices of drugs, and state Medicaid programs are increasingly
requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior
authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental
rebates are not being paid. It is likely that federal and state legislatures and
health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform in the
future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for
our products. 
33


     Since
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD and other eye diseases,
ZALTRAP® for oncology indications, and ARCALYST® for the
prevention of gout flares will likely be too expensive for most patients to
afford without health insurance coverage, if these products are unable to obtain
adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, including Medicare
and Medicaid in the United States, our ability to successfully commercialize
these products would be materially adversely impacted. The status of a J-code
for our marketed products could also affect reimbursement. J-codes are permanent
reimbursement codes maintained by CMS that are a component of HCPCS, and are
typically used to report injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be
self-administered. Although we have a J-Code for ARCALYST®, we do not
currently have a J-Code for EYLEA®, although we anticipate assignment
of a J-Code for EYLEA® in January 2013. Without a unique J-code identifier,
EYLEA® must be billed using a non-specific miscellaneous J-code.
Since such codes may be used for a wide variety of products, health plans may
have more difficulty determining the actual product used and billed for the
patient. As a result, these claims must often be submitted with additional
information and manually processed, which can create delays in claims processing
times as well as increasing the likelihood for claim errors. Third-party payers,
including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, may not cover and/or
reimburse for these products at levels required for us to successfully
commercialize these products. Any limitation imposed by third-party payers on
the use of our products if they are approved for marketing, any action or
decision by CMS or analogous foreign agencies or authorities which for any
reason denies coverage or reimbursement for our products or provides coverage or
reimbursement at levels that harm our products competitiveness or leads to
lower prices for those products, will have a material negative effect on our
ability to achieve profitability. In certain foreign countries, pricing,
coverage, and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to
governmental control, and we and our collaborators may be unable to obtain
coverage, pricing, and/or reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us or
necessary for us or our collaborators to successfully commercialize our products
in those countries. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug
must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing
drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European
Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal
products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement
and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state
may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a
system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company
placing the medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may
suffer if we or our collaborators are unable to market our products in foreign
countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries
is limited or delayed. 
Regulatory and Litigation Risks

   If the testing or
use of our products harms people, we could be subject to costly and damaging
product liability claims.
    
The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use in
people expose us to product liability risk. Any informed consent or waivers
obtained from people who enroll in our clinical trials may not protect us from
liability or the cost of litigation. We may also be subject to claims by
patients who use our approved products, ARCALYST® for the treatment
of CAPS, or EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD, or EYLEA®
for other indications, ZALTRAP®, or ARCALYST® for the
prevention of gout flares if those product candidates receive regulatory
approval and become commercially available, that they have been injured by a
side effect associated with the drug. We may face product liability claims and
be found responsible even if injury arises from the acts or omissions of our
third-party fill/finish or other providers. Our product liability insurance may
not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability
arising from any such litigation. Moreover, in the future we may not have access
to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.

If we market and sell approved products, in a way that
violates federal or state healthcare laws, we may be subject to civil or
criminal penalties. 
    
In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to
health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the
anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and
federal laws and regulations. Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit,
among other things, payments or other remuneration to induce or reward someone
to purchase, prescribe, endorse, or recommend a product that is reimbursed under
federal or state healthcare programs. If we provide payments or other
remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our
products, we could face liability under state and federal anti-kickback laws.

    
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting,
or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government,
or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false
claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a
variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly
providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers
would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services
inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set
reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not
approved, known as off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to
Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses, and submitting inflated best price
information to the Medicaid Rebate program.
34


     The majority
of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback
law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under
Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of
the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil
monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturers products from reimbursement
under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment. 
    
Even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws, government
investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of
significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would harm our
business and financial results and condition. Because of the breadth of these
laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our
business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws.

    
In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the
District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, and
West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to
establish marketing compliance programs, and file periodic reports with the
state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical
trials, and other activities. Similar requirements are being considered in other
states. In addition, as part of the PPACA, pharmaceutical companies will be
required to file reports with the federal government regarding payments made to
healthcare professionals. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and
the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear.
Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we
could face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and could receive
adverse publicity, which would harm our business and financial results and
condition. 
Risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents or
contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or
reputation. 
    
We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures
will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents,
contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, including without limitation, healthcare,
employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition, and privacy
laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal
investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our
ability to conduct business, results of operations, and reputation. 
Our operations may involve
hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws
and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, and we
may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of
hazardous materials. 
    
As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations,
we are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and
regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. Our
research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use
of chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. The
cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is
substantial. If an accident involving these materials or an environmental
discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or
face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage.

Our business is subject to
increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting
requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business and
financial results and condition.
    
We are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and
state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our Common
Stock is listed. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, have issued a significant number of new and
increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last
several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in
response to laws enacted by Congress, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and, most recently, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the
Dodd-Frank Act. There are significant corporate governance and executive
compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that expressly authorized
or required the SEC to adopt additional rules in these areas, such as
shareholder approval of executive compensation (so-called say on pay) and
proxy access. On January 25, 2011, the SEC adopted final rules concerning say
on pay. Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have
resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses
and a diversion of managements time from other business
activities. 
35


   Changes in laws and
regulations affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our
business. 
     All aspects of
our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing,
pricing, sales, litigation, and intellectual property rights, are subject to
extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable federal and state
laws and agency regulations could have a materially negative impact on our
business. These include:

changes in the FDA
  and foreign regulatory processes for new therapeutics that may delay or
  prevent the approval of any of our current or future product
  candidates;
new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions
  related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and
  services, including prescription drugs, that would make it more difficult for
  us to market and sell products once they are approved by the FDA or foreign
  regulatory agencies; 
changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may
  require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new
  products to market, which could materially increase our costs of doing
  business; and 
changes in FDA and foreign cGMPs that may make it
  more difficult and costly for us to maintain regulatory compliance and/or
  manufacture our marketed product and product candidates in accordance with
  cGMPs. 
    
As described above, the PPACA and potential regulations thereunder easing
the entry of competing follow-on biologics into the marketplace, other new
legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of
lower-cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions, and legislation on
comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and
possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.

Risks Related to Our Reliance on
Third Parties 
If our
antibody collaboration with Sanofi is terminated, our business operations and
financial condition, and our ability to discover, develop, manufacture, and
commercialize our pipeline of product candidates in the time expected, or at
all, would be materially harmed. 
     We
rely heavily on funding from Sanofi to support our target discovery and antibody research and development programs. Sanofi has
committed to pay up to $160 million per year, or a total of $1.28 billion, between 2010 and 2017 to fund our efforts to identify
and validate drug discovery targets and pre-clinically develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against such targets. Sanofi
has a one-time option to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over the
prior two years certain specified criteria are not satisfied. If this downward adjustment occurs, it will reduce our resources
available for antibody discovery activities and negatively affect our clinical pipeline. Sanofi also initially funds almost all
of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the clinical development of antibodies that Sanofi elects
to co-develop with us. We rely on Sanofi to fund these activities. In addition, with respect to those antibodies that Sanofi elects
to co-develop with us, such as sarilumab, REGN727, REGN668, REGN421, REGN910, REGN728,
and REGN1033, we rely on Sanofi to lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist with obtaining regulatory approval,
particularly outside the United States. We also rely on Sanofi to lead the commercialization efforts to support all of the antibody
products that are co-developed by Sanofi and us if they receive regulatory approval. If Sanofi does not elect to co-develop the
antibodies that we discover or opts-out of their development, we would be required to fund and oversee on our own the clinical
trials, any regulatory responsibilities, and the ensuing commercialization efforts to support those antibody products. For example,
during 2011 and 2012 to date, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development of REGN846
and REGN475, and decided not to opt-in to the REGN1154 program. If Sanofi terminates
the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results,
and financial condition would be materially harmed. We would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we
have anticipated to support our research and development efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that might
not be available on favorable terms or at all, or materially cut back on such activities. Even though none of the antibodies from
this collaboration may ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if Sanofi does not perform its obligations with respect
to antibodies that it elects to co-develop, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these antibody product candidates
will be significantly adversely affected.
If our
collaboration with Sanofi for ZALTRAP® is terminated,
or Sanofi materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business
operations, prospects, and financial condition, and our ability to develop,
manufacture, and commercialize ZALTRAP® in the time
expected, or at all, would be materially harmed. 
    
We rely heavily on Sanofi to lead much of the development of
ZALTRAP®. Sanofi initially funds all of the development expenses
incurred by both companies in connection with the ZALTRAP® program.
If the ZALTRAP® program continues, we will rely on Sanofi to assist
with funding the ZALTRAP® program, provide commercial manufacturing
capacity, enroll and monitor clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval,
particularly outside the United States, and lead the commercialization of
ZALTRAP®. While ZALTRAP® may not ever be successfully
developed and commercialized, if Sanofi fails to perform its obligations in a
timely manner, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize
ZALTRAP® in cancer indications will be significantly adversely
affected. Sanofi has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us
at any time upon twelve months advance notice. If Sanofi were to terminate its
collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the resources or skills to
replace those of our partner, which could require us to seek additional funding
that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause
significant delays in the development and/or manufacture of ZALTRAP®
and result in substantial additional costs to us. We have limited commercial
capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities.
Termination of the Sanofi collaboration agreement for ZALTRAP® would
create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and
commercialization of ZALTRAP®.
36


If our
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare for EYLEA® is terminated, or Bayer
HealthCare materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business
operations, prospects, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to
develop EYLEA® and commercialize
EYLEA® outside the United States in the time expected, or at all,
would be materially harmed. 
     We rely
heavily on Bayer HealthCare to assist with the development, and the
commercialization outside the United States, of EYLEA®. Under our
agreement with them, Bayer HealthCare is required to fund approximately half of
the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the
global EYLEA® development program. As the EYLEA® program
continues, we will continue to rely on Bayer HealthCare to assist with funding
the EYLEA® development program, continue to lead the development of
EYLEA® outside the United States, obtain regulatory approval outside
the United States, and provide all sales, marketing, and commercial support for
the product outside the United States. In particular, Bayer HealthCare has
responsibility for selling EYLEA® outside the United States using its
sales force. While we cannot assure you that EYLEA® will receive
regulatory approval in or outside the United States or be successfully
commercialized, if Bayer HealthCare does not perform its obligations in a timely
manner, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize
EYLEA® outside the United States will be significantly adversely
affected. Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate its collaboration
agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months advance notice,
depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. If Bayer HealthCare
were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the
resources or skills to replace those of our partner, which could require us to
seek additional funding or another collaboration that might not be available on
favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in the development
and/or commercialization of EYLEA® outside the United States and
result in substantial additional costs to us. We currently have limited
commercial capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these
capabilities outside the United States. Termination of the Bayer HealthCare
collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the
successful development and commercialization of EYLEA®, particularly
outside the United States. 
Our
collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their
efforts to support the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our
drug candidates and current and future products. 
    
We depend upon third-party collaborators, including Sanofi, Bayer
HealthCare, and service providers such as CROs, outside testing laboratories,
clinical investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers, fill/finish, and
product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical
and clinical development of our product candidates. We also depend, or will
depend, on some of these third parties in connection with the commercialization
of EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD, ARCALYST® for the
treatment of CAPS, and our late-stage product candidates and new indications for
our marketed products if they are approved for marketing. If any of our existing
collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us
or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement
in a timely manner or in compliance with applicable GMPs, Good Laboratory
Practices (GLPs), or GCP Standards, we could experience additional costs,
delays, and difficulties in the manufacture or development of, or in obtaining
approval by regulatory authorities for and successfully commercializing, our
product candidates. 
    
We rely on third-party service providers to support the distribution of
EYLEA® and ARCALYST® and for many other related activities
in connection with the commercialization of these marketed products. Despite our
arrangements with them, these third parties may not perform adequately. If these
service providers do not perform their services adequately, our sales of
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD and ARCALYST® for the
treatment of CAPS will suffer. 
Risk Related to Employees

We are
dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in
our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our
business will be harmed. 
    
We are highly dependent on certain of
our executive officers, other key members of our senior management team, and our
Chairman. If we are not able to retain any of these persons, our business may
suffer. In particular, we depend on the services of P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the
Chairman of our board of directors, Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our
President and Chief Executive Officer, George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our
Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron
Research Laboratories, and Neil Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior Vice President,
Research and Development Sciences. As we commercialize EYLEA® in the
United States for the treatment of wet AMD and prepare for commercialization in the
United States of EYLEA® for the treatment of CRVO and ARCALYST®
for the treatment of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering
therapy, should they receive regulatory approval, we will also be highly
dependent on the expertise and services of members of our senior management
leading these commercialization efforts. There is intense competition in the
biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the
development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able to
continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to
advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives.

Information Technology Risks

   Significant
disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could
adversely affect our business.
     Our business
is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information
technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support business
processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and
complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to
breakdown, malicious intrusion, and computer viruses which may result in the
impairment of production and key business processes.
    
In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security
breacheswhether by employees or otherswhich may expose sensitive data to
unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of
trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public
exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of
our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.
    
Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial
condition.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock

   Our stock price is
extremely volatile. 
    
There has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in
the market prices of biotechnology companies securities. Various factors and
events may have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock.
These factors include, by way of example: 

announcement of
  actions by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or their respective
  advisory committees regarding our, or our collaborators currently pending or
  future application(s) for regulatory approval of our product candidate(s) or
  new indications for our marketed products;
announcement of submission of an application for
  regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates or new
  indications for our marketed products;
progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical
  trials;
announcement of technological innovations or
  product candidates by us or competitors;
fluctuations in our operating results; in
  particular, net product sales of, and profits from, EYLEA® and, if
  any of our product candidates or our new indications for our marketed products
  receive regulatory approval, net product sales of, and profits from, these
  product candidates and new indications;
market acceptance of, and fluctuations in market share for, our marketed products,
  especially EYLEA®, and whether these factors, including our net
  products sales, underperform, meet, or exceed the expectations of investors or analysts; 
third-party claims
  that our products or technologies infringe their patents;
third-party challenges to our patents in the
  European Patent Office and in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office;
public concern as to the safety or effectiveness
  of any of our marketed products or product candidates or new indications for
  our marketed products, including EYLEA®, ZALTRAP®, or
  ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating
  uric acid-lowering therapy;
pricing or reimbursement actions or decisions by
  government authorities or insurers affecting the coverage or reimbursement of
  any of our marketed products or competitors products;
our ability to raise additional capital as needed
  on favorable terms; 
developments in our relationship with
  collaborative partners; 
developments in the biotechnology industry or in
  government regulation of healthcare;
large sales of our Common Stock by our executive
  officers, directors, or significant shareholders;
arrivals and departures of key personnel;
  and 
general market conditions.
38


     The trading
price of our Common Stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide
fluctuations in response to these and other factors, including the sale or
attempted sale of a large amount of our Common Stock in the market. Broad market
fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.

Future
sales of our Common Stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our
stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings.

    
A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount
of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2011, our six largest shareholders plus
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially
owned 61.9% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of
our Chief Executive Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common
Stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within
60 days of December 31, 2011. In September 2003, Sanofi (then Aventis
Pharmaceuticals Inc.) purchased 2,799,552 newly issued, unregistered shares of
our Common Stock, and in December 2007 Sanofi purchased an additional 12,000,000
newly issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock. Under our investor
agreement, as amended, with Sanofi, these shares may not be sold until December
20, 2017 except under limited circumstances and subject to earlier termination
of these restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, in
October 2010, Sanofi purchased an additional 1,017,401 shares of Common Stock in
our underwritten public offering. As of December 31, 2011, Sanofi beneficially
owned 15,816,953 shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 17.4% of
the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. If Sanofi, or our other significant
shareholders or we, sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public
market, or the perception that such sales may occur exists, the market price of
our Common Stock could fall. Sales of Common Stock by our significant
shareholders, including Sanofi, also might make it more difficult for us to
raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a
time and price that we deem appropriate. 
Our
existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters
requiring shareholder approval. 
    
Holders of Class A Stock, who are generally the shareholders who
purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering, are entitled
to ten votes per share, while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote
per share. As of December 31, 2011, holders of Class A Stock held 18.9% of the
combined voting power of all shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock then
outstanding. These shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to
significantly influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain
corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the
combined classes, including mergers and other business combinations. This may
result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider
to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our Common Stock. As of
December 31, 2011: 

our current executive officers and directors
  beneficially owned 12.0% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming
  conversion of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all
  options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of December
  31, 2011, and 25.0% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of
  Common Stock and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by
  such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011;
  and 
our six largest shareholders plus Leonard S.
  Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 61.9%
  of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of our Chief
  Executive Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common Stock and
  the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days
  of December 31, 2011. In addition, these seven shareholders held 65.1% of the
  combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A
  Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our Chief Executive
  Officer which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011.


    
Pursuant to an investor agreement, as amended, Sanofi has agreed to vote
its shares, at Sanofis election, either as recommended by our board of
directors or proportionally with the votes cast by our other shareholders,
except with respect to certain change of control transactions, liquidation or
dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the then outstanding
shares or voting rights of Common Stock and Class A Stock, and new equity
compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with our
historical equity compensation practices.
39




The
anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and of New York
corporate law and the contractual standstill provisions in our investor
agreement with Sanofi, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or other
change in control of us and could adversely affect the price of our Common
Stock. 
    
Our restated certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the New York
Business Corporation Law contain various provisions that could have the effect
of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management
that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of these provisions
could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to
elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also
limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares
of our Common Stock. These provisions include: 

authorization to
  issue blank check preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be
  created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder
  approval, with rights senior to those of our Common Stock and Class A
  Stock; 
a staggered board
  of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to
  replace all of our directors;
a requirement that removal of directors may only
  be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty
  percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, as
  well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled
  only by the remaining directors;
a provision whereby any action required or
  permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a
  meeting, only if, prior to such action, all of our shareholders consent, the
  effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a
  duly convened meeting;
a requirement that any shareholder seeking to
  bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely
  notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements;
  and
under the New York Business Corporation Law, in
  addition to certain restrictions which may apply to business combinations
  involving our company and an interested shareholder, a plan of merger or
  consolidation of our company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of
  all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. See the risk factor
  immediately above captioned Our existing
  shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring
  shareholder approval. 
     Until the
later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of our
antibody collaboration agreements with Sanofi or our ZALTRAP®
collaboration with Sanofi, Sanofi will be bound by certain standstill
provisions, as amended, which contractually prohibit Sanofi from acquiring more
than certain specified percentages of our Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken
together) or otherwise seeking to obtain control of our company.
    
In addition, we have a Change in Control Severance Plan and our Chief
Executive Officer has an employment agreement that provides severance benefits
in the event our officers are terminated as a result of a change in control of
our company. Many of our stock options issued under our 2000 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated, may become fully vested in connection with a
change in control of our company, as defined in the plan. These contractual
provisions may also have the effect of deterring, delaying, or preventing an
acquisition or other change in control. 
Risks Relating to Our Convertible
Senior Notes and Related Hedge Transactions 
The
convertible note hedges and warrant transactions we entered into in connection
with our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes issuance may affect the trading price
of our Common Stock. 
    
In connection with our offering of our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes
due October 1, 2016, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with
four financial institutions (the hedge counterparties). The convertible note
hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our Common
Stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of
the notes, as the case may be upon conversion of the notes. In the event that
the hedge counterparties fail to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments
as the case may be as required under the convertible note hedge documents, we
would not receive the benefit of such transactions. Separately, we also entered
into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. The warrant
transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of Common
Stock pursuant to the warrants.
    
In connection with hedging these transactions, the hedge counterparties
and/or their affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with
respect to our Common Stock, and may enter into, or may unwind, various
derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our Common Stock or other
securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the notes (and are likely
to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the notes).
These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in,
or could have a negative effect on, the value of our Common Stock and could have
the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the value of our Common
Stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the
notes.
40


     In addition,
we intend to exercise options under the convertible note hedge transactions
whenever notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge position with respect
to the options we exercise, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may
sell shares of our Common Stock or other securities in secondary market
transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our
Common Stock during the cash settlement averaging period for the converted
notes. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the
trading price of our Common Stock or the notes will depend in part on market
conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities
could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock and the value of the notes.
The derivative transactions that the hedge counterparties and/or their
affiliates expect to enter into to hedge these transactions may include
cash-settled equity swaps referenced to our Common Stock. In certain
circumstances, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may have
derivative positions that, when combined with the hedge counterparties and
their affiliates ownership of our Common Stock, if any, would give them
economic exposure to the return on a significant number of shares of our Common
Stock. 
The
fundamental change provisions of our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes and certain
of the terms of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may delay or
prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. 
    
The fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow noteholders to
require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a
fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, and the
provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in
connection with make-whole fundamental changes, as set forth in the indenture,
may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal
of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. In
addition, upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events, the convertible
note hedge transactions would be exercised upon the conversion of notes, and the
warrant transactions may be terminated. It is possible that the proceeds we
receive upon the exercise of the convertible note hedge transactions would be
significantly lower than the amounts we would be required to pay upon
termination of the warrant transactions. Such differences may result in the
acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our shareholders than it
would otherwise be.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

    
None. 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
    
We conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and administrative
activities at our owned and leased facilities. Under our lease in Tarrytown, New
York, as amended, we lease approximately 553,000 square feet of laboratory and
office facilities. In addition, in September 2011 we entered into a lease
amendment under our Tarrytown lease for approximately 40,000 additional square
feet of space, which will commence contingent upon certain building improvements
being completed by our landlord. We currently expect our landlord to complete
these improvements during the first half of 2012. The term of the Tarrytown, New
York lease will expire in June 2024. The lease contains three renewal options to
extend the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options on
approximately 323,000 square feet of space. The lease provides for monthly
payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and
operating expenses.
    
In July 2011, we leased approximately 19,600 square feet of office space
in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. The term of the lease expires in January
2017.

     We own
facilities in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of three buildings totaling
approximately 395,000 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and
warehouse space.
    
We believe that our existing owned and leased facilities are adequate for
ongoing research, development, manufacturing, and administrative activities. In
the future, we may lease, operate, or purchase additional facilities in which to
conduct expanded research and development and manufacturing activities and
support commercial operations. 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    
From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings in the course of
our business. We do not expect any such current ordinary course legal
proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.
Genentech Patent Litigation
    
We are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by
Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. We do not believe that
ZALTRAP® or EYLEA® infringe any valid claim in these
patents or patent applications. We are involved in five patent litigations with
Genentech, two in the United States and three in Europe. In November 2010, we
commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the Court), seeking a declaratory judgment that
no activities relating to our VEGF Trap infringe any valid claim of certain
Genentech patents referred to as the Davis-Smyth patents (the First Davis-Smyth
Case). Genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our
prior or planned activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will
infringe claims of four of the five Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment
against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as
the Court deems appropriate.
     On
December 31, 2011, we entered into a non-exclusive license and partial settlement agreement (the Agreement) with Genentech
that covers making, using, and selling EYLEA® in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human
eye diseases and disorders in the United States. Under the Agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth
patents, and certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Agreement does not cover any non-U.S.
patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes, and does not cover any use of
aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First
Davis-Smyth Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Agreement. The Agreement provides for us to make
payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA® through May 7, 2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents
expire. We will make a lump-sum payment of $60 million once cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® reach $400
million. We will also pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® between $400 million and $3
billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® over $3 billion. As a result of the Agreement, on
January 17, 2012 Genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended
its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the five Davis-Smyth patents. On December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a
related case in the Court against Regeneron and Sanofi alleging infringement of four of the five Davis-Smyth Patents by
activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA®) (the Second Davis-Smyth Case). As in the
First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new complaint Genentech requests a judgment against us for damages, including for willful
infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.
    
We believe Genentech's claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the
Second Davis Smyth Case are without merit and intend to continue to defend
against all of Genentechs remaining claims vigorously.
    
We have initiated patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany,
the United Kingdom, and Italy, and may initiate other actions in other countries
outside the United States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes
that would materially harm our business and which, irrespective of the outcomes,
may also entail significant costs and expenses.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND
      ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    
Overview 
     We are a fully
integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops,
manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical
conditions. We currently have two marketed products in the United States,
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection and ARCALYST® (rilonacept),
and a late-stage product candidate, ZALTRAP® (aflibercept), which has
been submitted for marketing approval in the United States and the European
Union by our collaborator Sanofi, as described below.
    
In November 2011, we received U.S. marketing approval from the FDA for
EYLEA® for the treatment of patients with wet AMD. Wet AMD is the
leading cause of acquired blindness for people over the age of 65 in the United
States and Europe. In the United States, the wet AMD market is approximately
$1.5 billion. Our net product sales of EYLEA® in the fourth quarter
of 2011 were $24.8 million. Our operating results over the next several years
will be largely dependent upon our ability to successfully commercialize
EYLEA® and the market penetration it achieves.
    
In 2011, Bayer HealthCare submitted regulatory applications for marketing
approval of EYLEA® in wet AMD in the European Union, Japan, and other
countries. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA to the FDA for marketing
approval of EYLEA® in CRVO in the United States and, under PDUFA,
were granted a target date for an FDA decision on our EYLEA®
supplemental BLA of September 23, 2012. Bayer HealthCare also plans to submit
regulatory applications in this indication in Europe in late 2012 or early
2013.
    
ARCALYST® (rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use is
available by prescription in the United States for the treatment of CAPS,
including FCAS and MWS in adults and children 12 and older. CAPS are a group of
rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions that afflict a small patient
population. Net product sales of ARCALYST® in 2011 were $19.9
million, and we do not expect future net product sales of ARCALYST®
for the treatment of CAPS to be significant. In November 2011, the FDA accepted
for review a supplemental BLA for marketing approval in the United States of
ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating
uric acid-lowering therapy. Under PDUFA, we were granted a target date for an
FDA decision on our ARCALYST® supplemental BLA of July 30,
2012.
    
Sanofi submitted a regulatory application for marketing approval of
ZALTRAP® for the treatment of previously-treated mCRC patients to the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the FDA in
early February 2012.
    
We expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential
commercialization of ARCALYST® for the treatment of gout flares in
patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy and ZALTRAP® for the
treatment of previously-treated mCRC patients and, if one or both receive
regulatory approval, to fund the launch of the product(s). Since inception, we
have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization
of EYLEA®, ARCALYST®, or any of our other product
candidates.
    
We have 13 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were
discovered in our research laboratories. Our Trap-based, late-stage programs
are: 

EYLEA®, which is being developed for
  the treatment of additional serious eye diseases; 
ZALTRAP®, which is being developed in
  oncology in collaboration with Sanofi; and 
ARCALYST®, which is being developed for
  the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering
  treatment.
46


    
Our antibody-based clinical programs include the following fully human
monoclonal antibodies: 

Sarilumab (REGN88), an antibody to the
  interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is being developed in rheumatoid
  arthritis; 
REGN727, an antibody to Proprotein Convertase
  Substilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is being developed for low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction;
REGN668, an antibody to the interleukin-4 receptor
  (IL-4R), which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic
  asthma; 
REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4
  (Dll4), a novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;
  
REGN910, an antibody to Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2),
  another novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;
  
REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF),
  which is being developed for the treatment of pain (currently on clinical
  hold); 
REGN728, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target;
REGN1033, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target; 
REGN846, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target, which is being developed in atopic dermatitis;
  and 
REGN1154, an antibody in clinical development
  against an undisclosed target.
     With the exception of REGN475,
REGN846, and REGN1154, which we are developing independently, all of these antibodies
are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi.
    
Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and
expense. Before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody
candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized, we (or
our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully
completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the
FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly
competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies
uncompetitive or obsolete.
    
Historically, we have generally incurred net losses and negative cash
flows from operations since our inception in 1988. Our potential to generate
profits and positive cash flow from operations over the next several years
depends significantly on our success in commercializing EYLEA®;
otherwise, we expect to continue to incur operating losses. We expect to
continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development
activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our
collaborators. Also, our research and development activities outside our
collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, may expand and require
additional resources. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to
quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed
products, as well as the scope and progress of our research and development
efforts, the timing of certain expenses, and the amount of reimbursement that we
receive from collaborators. We cannot predict whether or when
ZALTRAP® or new indications for our marketed products will receive
regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be
able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may
become profitable. 
    
A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time employees.
Our annual average headcount in 2011 was 1,568 compared with 1,249 in 2010 and
980 in 2009. In 2011, our average headcount increased primarily to support our
expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody
collaboration with Sanofi and in connection with commercializing EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD. In 2012, we expect our average
headcount to increase to approximately 1,800-1,850, primarily to support
antibody manufacturing at our Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities, and
activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of
ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating
uric acid-lowering treatment.
    
The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are
significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. In our
clinical programs, key events in 2011 and 2012 to date were, and plans for the
remainder of 2012 are, as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Use
of Estimates 
     A summary of
the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in Note 2 to our
Financial Statements, beginning on page F-7. The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the
financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical
if: 

It requires an assumption (or assumptions)
  regarding a future outcome; and 
Changes in the estimate or the use of different
  assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our
  results of operations or financial condition.
    
Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts
reflected in our financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual
experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in
our financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. The critical
accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described
below.
Revenue Recognition

Collaboration Revenue
    
We earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements
to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology
platforms. We currently have collaboration agreements with Sanofi and Bayer
HealthCare. The terms of collaboration agreements typically include
non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone)
payments, and payments for development activities. Non-refundable up-front
license payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are deferred
and recognized over the related performance period. We estimate our performance
period based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjust the performance
periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances.
Although we did not enter into, or materially modify, any collaboration
arrangements with multiple-deliverables in 2011, any future arrangements with
multiple deliverables will be divided into separate units of accounting if the
deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, including whether the
delivered item or items has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis.
Payments which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone,
involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is
achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
future service obligation associated with that milestone. Substantive performance
milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development
life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as completion of clinical
trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and receipt of approvals
by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is deemed to be a
substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) the enhancement in value to
the related development product candidate, (ii) our performance and the relative level of effort
required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone
relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is
considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms.
Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and
recognized over the related performance period.
    
We enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements
regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development
activities. We may share the costs of research and development activities with
our collaborator, such as in our EYLEA® collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare, or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the
costs of our research and development activities, such as in our
ZALTRAP® and antibody collaborations with Sanofi. We record our
internal and third-party development costs associated with these collaborations
as research and development expenses. When we are entitled to reimbursement of
all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a
collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration
revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. If the collaboration is a
cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform
development work and share costs, in periods when our collaborator incurs
development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, we also
recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of the
collaborators development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. In
certain cases, we may also share the costs of pre-launch commercialization
activities with our collaborators. We record our share of these costs as a
reduction of collaboration revenue.
50


     In connection
with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are
principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our
research and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope of
activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to
development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate
requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to
performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result
in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future.
In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development
programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or
contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications.
Also, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of
the agreement, we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up-front or
previously deferred payment at the time of the termination.
Product Revenue 
    
Product sales consist of U.S. sales of our two marketed products,
EYLEA® and ARCALYST®. Revenue from product sales is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product
and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or
determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, we have no
further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. Our
written contracts with our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively,
our customers) stipulate that product is shipped freight on board destination
(FOB destination). We record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our
customers.
    
We sell EYLEA® in the United States to three distributors and
several specialty pharmacies. We sell ARCALYST® in the United States
to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the distributors
and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product. For
EYLEA®, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the
product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST®, the
specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients.
    
Revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for
prompt pay discounts, rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs
(including Medicaid), product returns, distribution-related fees, and other
sales-related deductions. Calculating these provisions involves estimates and
judgments. We review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable
provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current
periods net product sales.
     Prompt
Pay Discounts:  No prompt pay discounts are currently  offered to our
customers on sales of EYLEA®. In connection with sales  of ARCALYST®, we offer discounts to
our customers for prompt  payments. We estimate these discounts based on customer terms and historical  experience, and
expect that our customers will always take advantage of this  discount. Therefore, we accrue 100% of the
prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each
ARCALYST® invoice at the time of sale. Our accrual for prompt pay  discounts was not material at December
31, 2011 and 2010. 
     Government
Rebates and Chargebacks: We estimate reductions to product sales for Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) programs,
and for certain other qualifying federal and state government programs. Based upon our contracts with government agencies, statutorily-defined
discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, and, in the case of EYLEA®, estimated
payer mix based on third-party market research data, we estimate and record an allowance for rebates and chargebacks. Our liability
for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for a current quarter, claims for prior quarters
that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, and invoices received for claims from prior quarters that
have not been paid. Our reserves related to discounted pricing offered to VA, Public Health Services (PHS), and other institutions
(collectively, qualified healthcare providers) represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments
to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to our customers. Our customers
charge us for the difference between what they pay for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare
providers. Our reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks
that customers have already claimed. Our government rebate and chargeback accruals were
$0.6 million at December 31, 2011, which was based on a percentage of gross sales. Government rebate and chargeback accruals were
not material at December 31, 2010.
51


     Product Returns: Consistent with industry practice, we offer our customers a
limited right to return product purchased directly from us, which is principally
based upon the products expiration date. We will accept returns for three
months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date. Product
returned is generally not resalable given the nature of our products and method
of administration. We develop estimates for product returns based upon
historical experience, inventory levels in the distribution channel, and other
relevant factors.
     We
have developed estimates for EYLEA® product returns, based on several factors, including (i) our historical experience
to date, and our expectation, that our customers will not stock significant supplies of EYLEA® due to contractual
limitations and other mitigating circumstances, (ii) historical industry information regarding product return rates for similar
specialty products, and (iii) the shelf life of the product. Estimates for ARCALYST® product returns have been
developed based primarily on our historical returns experience; to date, actual ARCALYST® product returns have
been negligible. We monitor product supply levels in the distribution channel, as well as sales by our customers of EYLEA®
to healthcare providers and ARCALYST® to patients using product-specific data provided by our customers.
If necessary, our estimates of product returns may be adjusted in
the future based on actual returns experience, known or expected changes in the marketplace, or other factors. Our
product returns accruals were not material at December 31, 2011 or 2010. 
     Distribution-Related Fees:
We have written contracts with our customers
that include terms for distribution-related fees. We estimate and record
distribution and related fees due to our customers based on a percentage of
gross sales. Our accrual for distribution-related fees was $1.5 million at
December 31, 2011. Our accrual for distribution-related fees at December 31,
2010 was not material.
Clinical Trial Expenses

    
Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and
development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors.
We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing
external entities such as CROs, independent clinical investigators, and other
third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical
studies. For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs
are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the
expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter
the trial, and the period over which clinical investigators or CROs are expected
to provide services.
    
Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other
administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily
by CROs. CROs typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials,
including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation,
pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these
start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. On an
actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our
contracts with CROs are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the
original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change
materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the
contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining
activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration,
generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study.
In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize
expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable
obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or
penalties.
    
For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a
per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue
expense on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and
activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a
quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the
study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required
level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and
drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the
study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are
typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number
of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple
years. During the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense
recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. Our estimates and
assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our
actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research
and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.
No material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made
during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009.
52


Stock-based
Compensation 
     We recognize
stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and
restricted stock under our long-term incentive plans to employees and
non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair
value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of an award is generally
recognized as compensation expense over the awards requisite service
period.
    
We use the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of
stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on
assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
(ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of
directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives),
(iii) expected dividend yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with
maturities approximating the options expected lives. Expected volatility has
been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives. Expected lives are
principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued
employee and board of directors option grants. The expected dividend yield is
zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any
in the foreseeable future. Stock-based compensation expense also includes an
estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are
expected to be forfeited. This estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
    
The assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect
our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other
conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Changes in any of these
assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and
the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
    
In addition, we have granted performance-based stock option awards which
vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service
conditions as defined in the agreements. Potential compensation cost, measured
on the grant date, related to these performance options will be recognized only
if, and when, we estimate that these options will vest, which is based on
whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of
attainment. Our estimates of the number of performance-based options that will
vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. Changes in these
estimates may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation that we
recognize in future periods related to performance-based options. 
Marketable
Securities 
    
We have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the
U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S.
government, and money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We
consider our marketable securities to be available-for-sale, as defined by
authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB). These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and
losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as a
separate component of stockholders equity. If the decline in the value of a
marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, we write down the security to its current fair value and
recognize a loss that may be charged against income. 
    
We review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative
and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to
which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts
of economic, market, or industry trends. With respect to debt securities, this review process
also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or
our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity.
With respect to equity securities, this review process includes an evaluation of
our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be
recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We
recorded no charges for other-than-temporary impairment of our marketable
securities during 2011, and inconsequential charges for other-than-temporary
impairment of our marketable securities during 2010 and 2009.
53


Depreciation of Property, Plant,
and Equipment
     Property,
plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended
or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the
estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of leasehold improvements may
change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in
the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
amount of depreciation recognized in future periods.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2011
and 2010
Net Loss
     We reported a net loss of $221.8 million,
or $2.45 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2011,
compared to a net loss of $104.5 million, or $1.26 per share (basic and diluted)
for 2010. The increase in our net loss in 2011 was principally due to higher
selling, general, and administrative expenses, partly in connection with
commercializing EYLEA® for wet AMD, and higher research and
development expenses.

     Sanofis
reimbursement of our ZALTRAP® expenses increased slightly in 2011
compared to 2010, primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing
ZALTRAP® supplies, offset by a decrease in other research and
development activities. Effective in 2011, we and Sanofi began equally sharing
pre-launch commercialization expenses related to ZALTRAP® in
accordance with the companies collaboration agreement. Our share of these
expenses was $9.3 million in 2011, which reduced our Sanofi collaboration
revenue. In connection with recognition of deferred revenue related to
ZALTRAP®, as of December 31, 2011, $22.6 million of the original
$105.0 million of up-front payments was deferred and will be recognized as
revenue in future periods. 
    
In 2011, Sanofis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of
$161.9 million under the discovery agreement and $137.4 million of development
costs under the license agreement, compared to $137.7 million and $138.3
million, respectively, in 2010. The higher reimbursement amount under the
discovery agreement in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in
our antibody discovery activities. The slightly lower reimbursement of
development costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in
development activities related to REGN475, which is currently on clinical hold,
offset generally by increases in development activities for other antibody
candidates. 
    
Recognition of deferred revenue related to Sanofis $85.0 million
up-front payment and other payments increased in 2011 compared to 2010. In
connection with the November 2009 amendment of the discovery agreement, Sanofi
is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our
manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of which $28.2
million was received or receivable as of December 31, 2011. Revenue related to
such funding from Sanofi is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue
prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the
recognition of the original $85.0 million up-front payment. As of December 31,
2011, $76.4 million of these up-front and other payments was deferred and will
be recognized as revenue in future periods. 
    
In August 2008, we entered into a separate VelociGene® agreement with
Sanofi. In 2011 and 2010, we recognized $1.6 million in revenue related to this
agreement.
Bayer HealthCare Collaboration
Revenue 
    
The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed
below, consisted of cost sharing of Regeneron EYLEA® development
expenses, substantive performance milestone payments, and recognition of revenue
related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October
2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for
the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive).

Cost-sharing of our global EYLEA® development expenses with
Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to lower
clinical development costs in connection with our Phase 3 VIEW 1 trial in wet
AMD and our Phase 2 trial in DME. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we earned two
$10.0 million substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare for achieving
positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the
COPERNICUS study. Recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front and August 2007 milestone payments from
Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2011 from 2010 due to an extension of the
estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being
recognized, effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2011,
$42.4 million of these up-front and milestone payments was deferred and will be
recognized as revenue in future periods.

55


Net Product Sales 
     Product sales
consist of U.S. sales of our two marketed products, EYLEA® and
ARCALYST®. We record product sales net of allowances and accruals for
prompt pay discounts, rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs
(including Medicaid), product returns, and distribution-related fees. We expect
our customers to stock limited supplies of our products due to (i) contractual
limitations that we and our customers establish, (ii) our products specialty
nature, sales price, and distribution channels, and (iii) our historical
experience to date.
    
In November 2011, we received marketing approval from the FDA for
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD, at which time product sales
commenced. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we  recognized as
revenue $24.8 million of EYLEA® net product sales.
    
In 2011 and 2010, we recognized as revenue $19.9 million and $25.3
million, respectively, of ARCALYST® net product sales.
ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited
auto-inflammatory diseases that affect a very small group of people, was our
first commercialized drug product. ARCALYST® net product sales in
2010 included $20.5 million of ARCALYST® net product sales made in
2010 and $4.8 million of previously deferred net product sales. 
    
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was no deferred revenue related to
net product sales.
Technology Licensing Revenue

     In
connection with our VelocImmune® license agreement with Astellas,
the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the second quarter of 2010 was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue
ratably over the ensuing year. In addition, in connection with the amendment and extension of our license agreement with Astellas,
in August 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue
ratably over a seven-year period beginning in June 2011. In connection with our VelocImmune license agreement with AstraZeneca,
which terminated effective as of February 2011, the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the first quarter of 2010
was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably through February 2011. In 2011 and 2010, we recognized $24.8 million
and $40.0 million, respectively, of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements. As of December 31, 2011, $151.7
million of the August 2010 technology licensing payment received from Astellas was deferred and will be recognized as revenue
in future periods. 
Contract Research and Other Revenue

     Contract
research and other revenue in 2011 and 2010 included $3.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, recognized in connection
with our five-year grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIHs Knockout Mouse
Project. As of the end of 2011, no further revenue will be recognized by us in connection with this NIH Grant. In addition,
under a June 2009 agreement with Novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of Novartis canakinumab. In 2011 and
2010, contract research and other revenue included $2.3 million and $0.7
million, respectively, of royalties from Novartis.
Expenses 
    
Total operating expenses increased to $651.0 million in 2011 from $556.5
million in 2010. Our average headcount in 2011 increased to 1,568 from 1,249 in
2010 principally as a result of our expanding research and development
activities, which were primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with
Sanofi, and 2011 activities in connection with commercializing EYLEA®
in wet AMD.
56


     Operating
expenses in 2011 and 2010 included a total of $56.1 million and $39.9 million,
respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option
and restricted stock awards (Non-cash Compensation Expense), as detailed below:

The increase in total Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2011 was primarily
attributable to (i) the recognition of higher expense in 2011 in connection with
performance-based stock options that we estimate will vest, (ii) the higher fair
market value of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option
grants made in December 2010 compared to recent prior years, and (iii) the
recognition of higher expense related to grants of restricted stock in December
2010.
Research and Development Expenses 
    
Research and development expenses increased to $529.5 million in 2011
from $489.2 million in 2010. The following table summarizes the major categories

(3)

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in
      periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs EYLEA® development
      expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development
      expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCares EYLEA® development
      expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us
      with estimated EYLEA® development expenses for the most recent
      fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCares estimate is reconciled to its actual
      expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion
      of its global EYLEA® development expenses that we are obligated
      to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.
57


     Payroll and
benefits increased principally due to increases in employee headcount and
Non-cash Compensation Expense for the reasons described above. Clinical trial
expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs related to our Phase 3 clinical
development program for ARCALYST® for the prevention of gout flares
in patients initiated uric acid-lowering therapy, our VIEW 1 trial for
EYLEA® in wet AMD, our Phase 2 trial for EYLEA® in DME,
and our clinical development program for REGN475, which is currently on clinical
hold, partly offset by higher costs related to our Phase 3 VISTA-DME study for
EYLEA®. Clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to
higher costs related to manufacturing supplies of EYLEA®,
ZALTRAP®, and antibody candidates, partly offset by lower costs
related to manufacturing clinical supplies of ARCALYST®. Research and
other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with
our antibody programs and regulatory submissions for marketing approvals for
EYLEA® in wet AMD and CRVO, and ARCALYST® for the
prevention of gout flares in patients initiated uric acid-lowering therapy.
Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our
higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and new and
expanded leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Cost-sharing of Bayer
HealthCares EYLEA® development expenses decreased primarily due to
lower costs related to Bayer HealthCares VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD, partly offset
by higher costs in connection with Bayer HealthCares Phase 3 VIVID-DME
trial.
    
We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in
clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain
costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing
and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under
our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCares
EYLEA® development expenses that we
are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development costs for
clinical development programs are shown below:

Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step
process regulated by the FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical
evaluation, leading up to the submission of an IND to the FDA which, if
successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of
the potential new drug. Clinical development typically involves three phases of
study: Phases 1, 2, and 3. The most significant costs in clinical development
are in Phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest
studies in the drug development process. Following successful completion of
Phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a BLA must be submitted to,
and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must approve the BLA prior to
commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request
additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase
the drug development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or
at the request of the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as
Phase 3b and 4 studies. Phase 3b studies are initiated and either completed or
substantially completed while the BLA is under FDA review. These studies are
conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing
studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has approved
a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery research, preclinical
development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development
of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. We may elect to add
such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of
our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period
in which we will be developing a product. For example, we, and our collaborators
where applicable, continue to explore further development of
ARCALYST®, ZALTRAP®, and EYLEA® in different
disease indications.
58


     There are
numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties
related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development,
uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials,
changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape
affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in
Item 1A, Risk Factors under Risks Related to the Development and Approval of
Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our Marketed Products, Risks
Related to Commercialization of Products, and Regulatory and Litigation
Risks. The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and subsequent compliance
with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory
approvals could materially adversely affect our business.
    
For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to
develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future
indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our
ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate
and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to
market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably
estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate
material product revenues and net cash inflows. 
Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses 
    
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $117.3 million
in 2011 from $65.2 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in compensation
expense and recruitment costs, principally in connection with higher headcount
in 2011, higher commercialization costs primarily in connection with
EYLEA® for wet AMD, an increase in Non-cash Compensation Expense for
the reasons described above, and higher legal expenses in connection with
patent-related litigation with Genentech.
Cost of Goods Sold 
     Cost of goods sold increased to $4.2
million in 2011 from $2.1 million in 2010, due primarily to our launch of
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011. Cost of goods
sold in 2011 and 2010 primarily consisted of royalties and the costs of
producing EYLEA® and ARCALYST® commercial
supplies.
Other Income and Expense

    
Investment income increased to $3.5 million in 2011 from $2.1 million in
2010 due to higher average balances of cash and marketable securities during
2011.
     Interest
expense increased to $21.3 million in 2011 from $9.1 million in 2010. In October 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes. Total interest expense in 2011 associated with these notes, including amortization
of the note discount and debt issuance costs, was $5.4 million. In addition, interest expense includes the imputed interest portion
of payments to our landlord to lease laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York, which totaled $15.6 million in 2011
and $9.1 million in 2010. The increase is due to our occupying in February 2011 an additional new building in Tarrytown and, therefore,
we began recognizing interest expense on the related payments to our landlord.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

    
In 2011, we recognized a $1.1 million income tax benefit, which
consisted primarily of $0.7 million related to tax legislation that allowed us
to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax
credits.

Sanofis reimbursement of our ZALTRAP® expenses decreased in
2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower costs related to internal research
activities and manufacturing ZALTRAP® clinical supplies.
    
In 2010, Sanofis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of
$137.7 million under the discovery agreement and $138.3 million of development
costs under the license agreement, compared to $99.8 million and $98.3 million,
respectively, in 2009. The higher reimbursement amounts in 2010 compared to 2009
were due to an increase in our research activities conducted under the discovery
agreement and increases in our development activities for antibody candidates
under the license agreement.
    
Recognition of deferred revenue related to Sanofis $85.0 million
up-front payment decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the November 2009
amendments to expand and extend the companies antibody collaboration. In
connection with the November 2009 amendment of the discovery agreement, Sanofi
is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our
manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of which $23.4 million
was received or receivable from Sanofi as of December 31, 2010. Revenue related
to these payments for such funding from Sanofi is deferred and recognized as
collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in
conjunction with the recognition of the original $85.0 million up-front
payment.
60


     In August
2008, we entered into a separate VelociGene® agreement with
Sanofi. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized $1.6 million and $2.7 million,
respectively, in revenue related to this agreement.
Bayer HealthCare Collaboration
Revenue 
    
The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed
below, consisted of cost sharing of Regeneron EYLEA® development
expenses, substantive performance milestone payments, and recognition of revenue
related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October
2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for
the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive).

     Cost-sharing
of our EYLEA® development expenses with Bayer HealthCare increased in
2010 compared to 2009 due to higher internal development activities and higher
clinical development costs in connection with our Phase 3 COPERNICUS trial in
CRVO. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we earned two $10.0 million substantive
milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare for achieving positive 52-week results
in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study. In
July 2009, we earned a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment
from Bayer HealthCare in connection with the dosing of the first patient in the
COPERNICUS study.
Net Product Sales 
     In
2010 and 2009, we recognized as revenue $25.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, of ARCALYST® net product
sales. We had limited historical returns experience for ARCALYST®
beginning with initial sales in 2008 through the end of 2009; therefore, ARCALYST® net product sales were deferred
until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. Effective in the first quarter of 2010,
we determined that we had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of ARCALYST®.
As a result, $4.8 million of previously deferred ARCALYST® net product sales were recognized as revenue in the
first quarter of 2010. The effect of recognizing the previously deferred ARCALYST® net product sales revenue was
to lower our net loss per share by $0.06 in 2010. At December 31, 2010, there was no deferred revenue related to ARCALYST®
net product sales.
Technology Licensing Revenue

    
In connection with our VelocImmune® license agreements with
AstraZeneca and Astellas, each of the $20.0 million annual, non-refundable
payments were deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over
approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. In both 2010 and 2009, we
recognized $40.0 million of technology licensing revenue related to these
agreements. In addition, in connection with the amendment and extension of our
license agreement with Astellas, in August 2010, we received a $165.0 million
up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized as
revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in June 2011.

Contract Research and Other Revenue

     Contract
research and other revenue in 2010 and 2009 included $4.6 million and $5.5
million, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year grant from
the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIHs Knockout
Mouse Project.
Expenses 
    
Total operating expenses increased to $556.5 million in 2010 from $453.4
million in 2009. Our average headcount in 2010 increased to 1,249 from 980 in
2009 principally as a result of our expanded research and development
activities, which were primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with
Sanofi.
    
Operating expenses in 2010 and 2009 included a total of $39.9 million and
$31.3 million, respectively, of Non-cash Compensation Expense, as detailed
below:

of higher expense in 2010 in connection with performance-based stock options
that we estimate will vest, (ii) the increase in stock option awards in 2010,
due in part to the increase in headcount, and (iii) the higher fair market value
of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in
December 2009 compared to December 2008.
Research and Development Expenses 
     Research and development expenses
increased to $489.2 million in 2010 from $398.8 million in 2009. The following

      million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2010 and 2009,
      respectively.

Represents the full cost of
      manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and
      clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, Non-cash
      Compensation Expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling,
      packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our
      Rensselaer manufacturing facility. Includes $3.0 million and $2.6 million
      of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2010 and 2009,
  respectively.


(3)

Under our collaboration with
      Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs
      EYLEA® development expenses, we also recognize, as additional
      research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCares
      EYLEA® development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse.
      Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated EYLEA® development
      expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCares estimate
      is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent
      fiscal quarter and our portion of its global EYLEA® development
      expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted
    accordingly.
     Payroll and
benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above. Clinical trial expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs
related to our Phase 3 clinical development program for ARCALYST® in
gout, partly offset by higher costs related to our clinical development programs
for EYLEA®, principally in connection with our COPERNICUS trial in
CRVO. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due to higher facility-related
costs in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity at our
Rensselaer facility and higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies
of monoclonal antibodies, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing
ZALTRAP® clinical supplies. Research and other development costs
increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs.
Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our
higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and new and
expanded leased laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York.
Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCares EYLEA® development expenses
increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with Bayer HealthCares
VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD.
    
We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in
clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain
costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing
and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under
our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCares
EYLEA® development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our
estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs
are shown below:

     For the
reasons described above under Research and Development Expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and due to the variability in the costs
necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to
future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects,
and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization,
accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product
candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to
reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will
generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. 
Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses 
     Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased to $65.2 million in 2010 from
$52.9 million in 2009 due primarily to increases in compensation expense and
recruitment costs, principally in connection with higher headcount in 2010, and
an increase in Non-cash Compensation Expense for the reasons described
above.
63


Cost of Goods Sold 
    
Cost of goods sold in 2010 and 2009 was $2.1 million and $1.7 million,
respectively, and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs
related to ARCALYST® commercial supplies. During 2010 and 2009,
ARCALYST® shipments to our customers primarily consisted of supplies
of inventory manufactured and expensed as research and development costs prior
to FDA approval in 2008; therefore, the costs of these supplies were not
included in costs of goods sold. 
Other Income and Expense

    
Investment income decreased to $2.1 million in 2010 from $4.5 million in
2009, due primarily to lower yields on, and lower average balances of, cash and
marketable securities.
    
Interest expense increased to $9.1 million in 2010 from $2.3 million in
2009. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the imputed interest portion
of payments to our landlord, commencing in the third quarter of 2009, to lease
newly constructed laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New
York.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

    
In 2010, we did not recognize any income tax expense or benefit. In 2009,
we recognized a $4.1 million income tax benefit, consisting primarily of (i)
$2.7 million resulting from tax legislation that allowed us to claim a refund of
U.S. federal alternative minimum tax that we paid in 2008, and (ii) $0.7 million
resulting from tax legislation that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion
of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits. 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
    
Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations primarily
through offerings of our equity securities, private placements of convertible
debt, purchases of our equity securities by our collaborators, including Sanofi,
revenue earned under our past and present research and development agreements,
including our agreements with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, EYLEA® and
ARCALYST® product revenue, our technology licensing agreements, our
past contract manufacturing agreements, and investment income.
Sources and Uses of Cash for the
Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 
    
At December 31, 2011, we had $810.6 million in cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable securities (including $7.7 million of restricted cash and
marketable securities) compared with $626.9 million at December 31, 2010
(including $7.5 million of restricted cash and marketable securities) and $390.0
million (including $1.6 million of restricted cash) at December 31, 2009. In
October 2011, we completed a private placement of $400.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes and received net proceeds of
approximately $391.1 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount
and issuance costs. In connection with the offering of the convertible senior
notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, which
had a net cost to us of $23.7 million. In October 2010, we completed an
underwritten public offering of 6,325,000 shares of Common Stock and received
net proceeds of $174.8 million. In connection with the July 2010 amendment and
extension of our non-exclusive license agreement with Astellas, we received a
$165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas in August 2010.
Cash (Used in) Provided by
Operations 
    
Net cash used in operations was $141.7 million in 2011 and $69.9 million
in 2009, and net cash provided by operations was $99.2 million in 2010. Our net
losses of $221.8 million in 2011, $104.5 million in 2010, and $67.8 million in
2009 included $56.1 million, $39.9 million, and $31.3 million, respectively, of
Non-cash Compensation Expense. Our net losses also included depreciation and
amortization of $31.1 million, $19.7 million, and $14.2 million in 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively.
64


     At December
31, 2011, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by $21.1 million,
compared to end-of-year 2010, primarily due to EYLEA® product sales,
which commenced in November 2011. Due to the payment terms granted to our
customers, our EYLEA® product sales in 2011, generally, had not yet
been collected as of December 31, 2011. Our deferred revenue at December 31,
2011 decreased by $40.3 million, compared to end-of-year 2010, primarily due to
(i) amortization of the $165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas, as
described above, which was initially deferred and is being recognized ratably
over the seven-year period that commenced in mid-2011, and (ii) amortization of
previously deferred payments under our Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare
collaborations. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities
increased $50.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to end-of-year 2010,
primarily in connection with (i) higher payroll-related liabilities, due in part
to funding payment of our year-end 2010 employee cash bonuses prior to December
31, 2010 whereas year-end 2011 employee cash bonuses were funded subsequent to
December 31, 2011 and (ii) our expanded levels of activities and expenditures,
partly in connection with EYLEA® commercialization activities.

    
At December 31, 2010, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by
$17.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2009, primarily due to a higher
receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Our
deferred revenue at December 31, 2010 increased by $158.2 million, compared to
end-of-year 2009, primarily due to (i) the receipt of the $165.0 million
up-front payment from Astellas, as described above, which was deferred, and (ii)
Sanofis funding of $22.9 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us during
2010 to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facilities, which
was deferred and is being recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over
the related performance period in conjunction with the original $85.0 million
up-front payment received from Sanofi. These increases were partly offset by
amortization of previously received deferred payments under our Sanofi and Bayer
HealthCare collaborations.
    
At December 31, 2009, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by
$30.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2008, primarily due to a higher
receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Our
deferred revenue at December 31, 2009 decreased by $27.5 million, compared to
end-of-year 2008, primarily due to the amortization of previously received
deferred payments under our collaborations with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare.
Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased $12.6
million at December 31, 2009, compared to end-of-year 2008, primarily in
connection with our expanded levels of activities and expenditures, including
higher liabilities for clinical-related expenses, which were partly offset by an
$8.6 million decrease in the cost-sharing payment due to Bayer HealthCare in
connection with our EYLEA® collaboration. 
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing
Activities 
    
Net cash provided by investing activities was $128.5 million in 2011,
compared with net cash used in investing activities of $437.0 million and $2.1
million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales or maturities of marketable
securities exceeded purchases by $186.0 million in 2011 and $95.1 million in
2009. In 2010, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities
by $331.4 million. Capital expenditures of $57.2 million, $99.7 million, and
$97.3 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, included costs in
connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York
facilities and tenant improvements and related costs in connection with our
leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York.
Cash Provided by Financing
Activities 
    
Net cash provided by financing activities was $384.2 million in 2011,
$243.3 million in 2010 and $31.4 million in 2009. As described above, in October
2011, we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes and received
net proceeds of $391.1 million, and entered into convertible note hedge and
warrant transactions, which had a net cost to us of $23.7 million. Also as
described above, in October 2010, we completed an offering of our Common Stock
and received net proceeds of $174.8 million. In addition, net proceeds from
issuances of Common Stock in connection with exercises of stock options were
$18.5 million in 2011, $22.0 million in 2010, and $8.6 million in 2009. In 2010
and 2009, we received $47.5 million and $23.6 million, respectively, of tenant
improvement reimbursements from our landlord in connection with our Tarrytown
facilities, which we are deemed to own in accordance with FASB authoritative
guidance.

     In addition,
at December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $485.4 million and $113.0 million,
respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily held in
money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. 
    
We classify our investments using a three-tier fair value hierarchy,
which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three tiers are
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are
either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable
inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity
to develop its own assumptions. Our methods for valuing our marketable
securities are described in Note 6 to our financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
    
We held one Level 3 marketable security, which had no fair value
at December 31, 2011 and 2010. This Level 3 security was valued using
information provided by our investment advisors and other sources,
including quoted bid prices which took into consideration the securities lack
of liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded
charges for other-than-temporary impairment of this Level 3 marketable security
totaling $0.1 million; therefore, as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of
this security had been written down to zero. There were no purchases, sales, or
maturities of Level 3 marketable securities and no unrealized gains or losses
related to Level 3 marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010. There were no transfers of marketable securities between Levels 1, 2,
or 3 classifications during the years ended December 31, 2011 and
2010.
Collaborations with Sanofi

ZALTRAP®(aflibercept)
    
In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to Sanofi U.S.) to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of ZALTRAP® in all countries other
than Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize
ZALTRAP®. Sanofi made a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0
million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common
Stock for $45.0 million.
66


     In January
2005, we and Sanofi amended the collaboration agreement to exclude, from the
scope of the collaboration, the development and commercialization of
ZALTRAP® for intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with this
amendment, Sanofi made a $25.0 million non-refundable payment to us. 
    
In December 2005, we and Sanofi amended our collaboration agreement to
expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development
of ZALTRAP® to include Japan. In connection with this amendment,
Sanofi agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us,
which was received in January 2006. Under the collaboration agreement, as
amended, we and Sanofi will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if
any, of ZALTRAP® outside of Japan for disease indications included in
our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of approximately 35%
on annual sales of ZALTRAP®. We may also receive up to $400 million
in substantive milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals,
including up to $360 million in milestone payments related to the receipt of
marketing approvals for up to eight ZALTRAP® oncology and other
indications in the United States or the European Union and up to $40 million
related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to five ZALTRAP®
oncology indications in Japan.
    
We have agreed to manufacture clinical supplies of ZALTRAP® at
our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi has agreed to be responsible for
providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for
ZALTRAP®.
     Under
the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed-upon worldwide ZALTRAP® development expenses incurred by both
companies during the term of the agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply, will be funded
by Sanofi. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of these development expenses
in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan
royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. Since inception of the collaboration agreement through December 31, 2011, we and
Sanofi have incurred $763.4 million in agreed-upon development expenses related
to ZALTRAP®. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will also be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of
the $25.0 million payment received in connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement. In addition,
if the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale
of a ZALTRAP® product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin reimbursing Sanofi for up to $7.5 million
of ZALTRAP® development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial ZALTRAP®
sale under the collaboration occurs. As described above under Item 1. Business  Clinical Programs, based upon
the positive findings in the Phase 3 VELOUR study, Sanofi has submitted a regulatory application for marketing approval of ZALTRAP®
for the treatment of previously-treated mCRC patients to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the FDA in February 2012.
In addition, the Phase 3 VENICE study for the first-line treatment for hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer in combination
with docetaxel/prednisone is ongoing. 
    
Sanofi funded $16.9 million, $16.5 million, and $26.6 million,
respectively, of our ZALTRAP® development costs in 2011, 2010, and
2009. In addition, in 2011, we and Sanofi began equally sharing ZALTRAP®
pre-launch commercialization expenses under the collaboration
agreement; as a result, we funded $9.3 million of Sanofis ZALTRAP®
pre-launch commercialization expenses in 2011. At December 31, 2011, there
was a net payable of $3.7 million to Sanofi in connection with the companies
ZALTRAP® collaboration, and at December 31, 2010 and 2009, amounts
receivable from Sanofi in connection with the ZALTRAP® collaboration
were $3.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. In addition, the up-front
payments from Sanofi of $80.0 million in September 2003 and $25.0 million in
January 2006 were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as
contract research and development revenue over the period during which we expect
to perform services. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $9.9 million per
year of revenue, respectively, related to these up-front payments. 
    
Sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at
least twelve months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement for any
reason, any remaining obligation to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of
ZALTRAP® development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
rights to ZALTRAP®. 
Antibodies
      In
November 2007, we and Sanofi entered into a global, strategic  collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully
human monoclonal  antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical  Development Agreement and a
License and Collaboration Agreement. In connection  with the execution of the discovery agreement in 2007, we received a
non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from Sanofi. Pursuant to the
collaboration, Sanofi  is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery  targets and develop fully
human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. In  November 2009, we and Sanofi amended these collaboration agreements to
expand  and extend our antibody collaboration. Under the amended discovery agreement,  Sanofi agreed to fund up to $160
million per year of our antibody discovery  activities in 2010 through 2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to
adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing  in 2014 if over the prior two years certain
specified criteria were not  satisfied. In 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery  activities,
Sanofi funded $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the  amended discovery agreement. The balance between that
amount and $160 million,  or $22.3 million, has been added to the funding otherwise available to us in  2011-2012 under the
amended discovery agreement. The amended discovery agreement  will expire on December 31, 2017; however, Sanofi has an option
to extend the  agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development  and preclinical
activities.
67


     For each drug candidate identified through
discovery research under the discovery agreement, Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement.
If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Under certain defined circumstances,
upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, Sanofi must make a $10 million substantive milestone payment
to us. Under the license agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the
agreement are funded by Sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug
candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs) are shared 80% by
Sanofi and 20% by us. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of development
expenses that were fully funded by Sanofi (or half of $582.3 million as of December
31, 2011) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and
our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. However, we are not required to apply
more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing Sanofi for these
development costs. If Sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license agreement,
we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and Sanofi will receive a royalty on sales, if
any.
    
Sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed
under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products.
The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United
States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding
scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55%
(Sanofi)/45% (us), and losses outside the United States at 55% (Sanofi)/45%
(us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250
million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing only if
and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion
on a rolling 12-month basis.
    
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply
clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until
commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. In connection
with the November 2009 amendment of the collaborations discovery agreement,
Sanofi is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to
expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of
which $28.2 million was received or receivable as of December 31, 2011.

    
In 2011, 2010, and 2009, Sanofi funded $161.9 million, $137.7 million,
and $99.8 million, respectively, of our expenses under the collaborations
discovery agreement and $137.4 million, $138.3 million, and $98.3 million,
respectively, of our development costs under the license agreement. Of these
amounts, $75.6 million, $73.4 million and $57.9 million were included in
accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The
$85.0 million up-front payment received from Sanofi in December 2007 was
recorded to deferred revenue and is being recognized as collaboration revenue
over the period during which we expect to perform services. In addition,
reimbursements by Sanofi of our costs to expand our manufacturing capacity are
recorded to deferred revenue and recognized prospectively as collaboration
revenue over the same period applicable to recognition of the $85.0 million
up-front payment. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $8.2 million, $7.3
million, and $9.9 million of revenue, respectively, related to these deferred
payments.
    
In connection with the antibody collaboration, in August 2008, we entered
into a separate agreement with Sanofi to use our proprietary VelociGene® technology platform to
supply Sanofi with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and
disease. The agreement provides for minimum annual order quantities for the term of the agreement, which extends through December
2012, for which we expect to receive payments totaling a minimum of $21.5
million, of which $12.7 million had been received as of December 31, 2011.

68


     With respect
to each antibody product which enters development under the license agreement,
Sanofi or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development
and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains
exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the
product. We may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product
if we give notice to Sanofi within thirty days of the date that Sanofi elects to
jointly develop such antibody product under the license agreement. Each of the
discovery agreement and the license agreement contains other termination
provisions, including for material breach by the other party. Prior to December
31, 2017, Sanofi has the right to terminate the amended discovery agreement
without cause with at least three months advance written notice; however, except
under defined circumstances, Sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to us
the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the
research agreement through December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the
collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse Sanofi for
development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will
terminate.
     In December
2007, we sold Sanofi 12 million newly issued, unregistered shares of Common
Stock at an aggregate cash price of $312.0 million, or $26.00 per share of
Common Stock. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, Sanofi entered
into an investor agreement with us. This agreement, which was amended in
November 2009, contains certain demand rights, stand-still provisions, and
other restrictions, which are more fully described in Note 13 to our Financial
Statements. In addition, in October 2010, Sanofi purchased 1,017,401 shares of
Common Stock in our underwritten public offering. 
Collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare 
     In
October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare to globally develop, and commercialize
outside the United States, EYLEA®. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a non-refundable up-front
payment to us of $75.0 million. In August 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment (which, for the purpose of revenue
recognition, was not considered substantive) from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the VIEW 1 study of
EYLEA® in wet AMD. In July 2009, we received a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment from Bayer
HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the COPERNICUS study of EYLEA® in CRVO. In both December 2010
and January 2011, we received a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment (for a total of $20.0 million) from Bayer HealthCare
for achieving positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study, respectively.
We are eligible to receive up to $50 million in future substantive milestone payments related to marketing approvals of
EYLEA® in major market countries outside the United States. We are also eligible to receive up to $135
million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of EYLEA® outside the United States achieve certain
specified levels starting at $200 million.
    
We will share equally with Bayer HealthCare in any future profits arising
from the commercialization of EYLEA® outside the United States. If
EYLEA® is granted marketing authorization in a major market country
outside the United States and the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be
obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of our share of the collaboration
profits for 50% of the agreed-upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare
has incurred (or half of $370.9 million at December 31, 2011) in accordance with
a formula based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has
incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our
option. Within the United States, we are responsible for any commercialization
of EYLEA® and retain exclusive rights to any future profits from such
commercialization in the United States. In June 2011, Bayer HealthCare submitted
regulatory applications for marketing approval of EYLEA® in wet AMD
in the European Union, Japan, and other countries. We and Bayer HealthCare
continue to evaluate EYLEA® in certain Phase 3 programs in patients
with wet AMD, and are evaluating EYLEA® in Phase 3 programs in
patients with CRVO, DME, and CNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia.
We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical
and commercial product requirements.
    
The $75.0 million up-front payment and the $20.0 million milestone
payment received in August 2007 from Bayer HealthCare were recorded to deferred
revenue. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $9.4 million, $9.9 million, and
$9.9 million, respectively, of revenue related to these payments. The $10.0
million substantive milestone payments received from Bayer HealthCare in each of
December 2010 and January 2011 were recognized as collaboration revenue in 2010,
and the $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment received from
Bayer HealthCare in July 2009 was recognized as collaboration revenue in
2009.
69


     Under the terms of the agreement, in 2009
and thereafter, all agreed upon EYLEA® development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development
plan will be shared equally. Primarily in connection with sharing development expenses in 2011, 2010, and 2009, net amounts paid
or payable to Bayer HealthCare were $8.3 million, $2.6 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2011, $4.5 million was receivable from Bayer HealthCare, and at December 31, 2010, $2.3 million was payable to Bayer
HealthCare, in connection with cost-sharing of EYLEA® expenses under the collaboration.
     Bayer
HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least
six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined circumstances at
the time of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for any
reason, we retain all rights to EYLEA®. 
License Agreement with
Astellas 
    
Under this non-exclusive license agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million
annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. In
July 2010, the license agreement with Astellas was amended and extended through
June 2023. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Astellas made a $165.0
million up-front payment to us in August 2010. In addition, Astellas will make a
$130.0 million second payment to us in June 2018 unless the license agreement
has been terminated prior to that date. Astellas has the right to terminate the
agreement at any time by providing 90 days advance written notice. Under
certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement,
Astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its
up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after June 2018, a portion of
its second payment, to us under the July 2010 amendment to the agreement. We are
entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
products discovered by Astellas using our VelocImmune® technology.

License Agreement with
AstraZeneca 
    
Under this non-exclusive license agreement, AstraZeneca made a $20.0
million annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and
2007. In November 2010, as permitted by the agreement, MedImmune Limited (as
successor by novation from AstraZeneca) gave written notice of voluntary
termination of the agreement, effective in February 2011. We remain entitled to
receive mid-single digit royalties on any future sales of antibody products
discovered by MedImmune using our VelocImmune® technology.

National Institutes of Health
Grant 
    
Under our five-year grant from the NIH, as amended, we were entitled to
receive a minimum of $25.3 million over the five-year period beginning in
September 2006, subject to compliance with the grants terms and annual funding
approvals, including $1.5 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES cell line
and its proprietary growth medium. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we earned $3.6
million, $4.6 million, and $5.5 million, respectively, of funding under the NIH
Grant, of which $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, was receivable at
the end of 2011 and 2010. Other than the amount receivable at the end of 2011,
no further funding will be received by us in connection with the NIH Grant.

License Agreement with
Cellectis 
    
In July 2008, we and Cellectis S.A. entered into an Amended and Restated
Non-Exclusive License Agreement. The amended license agreement resolved a
dispute between the parties related to the interpretation of a license agreement
entered into by the parties in December 2003 pursuant to which we licensed
certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific
replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous
recombination. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, in July 2008, we made
a non-refundable $12.5 million payment to Cellectis and agreed to pay Cellectis
a low single-digit royalty based on revenue received by us from any future
licenses or sales of our VelociGene® or
VelocImmune® products and services. No royalties are payable to Cellectis with
respect to our VelocImmune® license
agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or our antibody collaboration with
Sanofi. In addition, no royalties are payable to Cellectis on any revenue from
commercial sales of antibodies from our VelocImmune® technology. We
are amortizing our $12.5 million payment to Cellectis in
proportion to past and anticipated future revenues under our license agreements
with AstraZeneca and Astellas and our antibody discovery agreement with Sanofi
(as amended in November 2009).
70


License and Partial Settlement
Agreement with Genentech 
     In December
2011, we and Genentech entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial
Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA® in the
United States. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to
certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth
patents, and other technology patents. The Davis-Smyth patents are the subject
of patent litigation between us and Genentech now pending in the United States
District Court, Southern District of New York. Patent litigation is continuing
with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement (see Item 3.
Legal Proceedings).
     Under the
terms of the agreement with Genentech, we agreed to make payments to Genentech
based on U.S. sales of EYLEA® commencing upon FDA approval of
EYLEA® in November 2011 through May 7, 2016. We will be required to
make a one-time, non-refundable $60 million payment upon cumulative U.S. sales
of EYLEA® reaching $400 million. In addition, we agreed to pay
royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® between $400
million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S sales of EYLEA®
over $3 billion. As we record net product sales of EYLEA®, we are recognizing expense in connection with the Genentech Agreement using
a blended mid-single digit royalty rate that reflects both the $60 million
payment and the royalties payable on cumulative sales and that is based upon our estimate of cumulative EYLEA® sales through May 7,
2016.
Lease  Tarrytown, New York
Facilities 
    
We lease approximately 553,000 square feet of laboratory and office space
at facilities in Tarrytown, New York, under a December 2006 lease agreement, as
amended. These facilities include approximately 230,000 square feet of newly
constructed space in two new buildings (Buildings A and B) that were completed
during the third quarter of 2009 and approximately 131,000 square feet of
additional new space in a third new building (Building C), that was completed in
early 2011. The lease will expire in June 2024 and contains three renewal
options to extend the term of the lease by five years each, as well as early
termination options on approximately 323,000 square feet of space. The lease
provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for
utilities, taxes, and operating expenses. In connection with the lease, we have
issued a $3.4 million letter of credit to our landlord, which is fully
collateralized by cash and marketable securities.
    
Certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operating leases.
However, for Buildings A, B, and C that we are leasing, we are deemed, in
substance, to be the owner of the landlords buildings in accordance with the
application of FASB authoritative guidance. As a result, we capitalized the
landlords costs of constructing these new facilities and recognized a
corresponding facility lease obligation. We also recognized, as additional
facility lease obligation, reimbursements from our landlord for tenant
improvement costs that we incurred since, under FASB authoritative guidance,
such payments that we receive from our landlord are deemed to be a financing
obligation. Monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the
land element of the lease (which is accounted for as an operating lease) and the
facility lease obligation, based on the estimated relative fair values of the
land and buildings. 
    
As of December 31, 2010, we had capitalized the landlords costs of
constructing Buildings A and B, which totaled $58.4 million, and of constructing
Building C, which totaled $27.8 million. Reimbursements from our landlord for
Buildings A and B tenant improvement costs totaled $56.9 million and were
received by us during 2010 and 2009. Reimbursements for Building C tenant
improvement costs totaled $14.2 million and were received by us during 2010.
With respect to Buildings A and B, monthly lease payments commenced in August
2009, the buildings were placed in service by us in September 2009, and the
imputed interest rate applicable to our facility lease obligation is
approximately 11%. With respect to Building C, monthly lease payments commenced
in January 2011, the building was placed in service by us in February 2011, and
the imputed interest rate applicable to our facility lease obligation is
approximately 9%. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Buildings A and B facility
lease obligation balance was $113.0 million and $113.7 million, respectively,
and the Building C facility lease obligation balance was $47.5 million and $46.4
million, respectively. 
71


Capital Expenditures

     Our cash
expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $57.2 million in 2011,
$99.7 million in 2010, and $97.3 million in 2009. We received $47.5 million in
2010 and $23.6 million in 2009 from our landlord in connection with tenant
improvement costs in Buildings A, B, and C in Tarrytown, as described above. In
addition, in connection with the companies antibody collaboration, Sanofi
funded $4.8 million in 2011, $22.9 million in 2010, and $0.5 million in 2009 of
agreed-upon capital expenditures incurred by us to expand our manufacturing
capacity at our Rensselaer facilities, of which $1.7 million was receivable at
December 31, 2011.
    
We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $50 to $70
million in 2012, primarily in connection with tenant improvements at our leased
Tarrytown facilities, capital improvements at our Rensselaer, New York
manufacturing facilities, and purchases of equipment. We expect to be reimbursed
for a small portion of these capital expenditures for our Rensselaer facilities
by Sanofi, with the remaining amount to be funded by our existing capital
resources.
Offering of Convertible Senior
Notes 
    
In October 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of
1.875% convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes were offered
by the initial purchaser only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933. 
    
The notes will pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1,
beginning April 1, 2012, and will mature on October 1, 2016, unless earlier
converted or repurchased. The notes will be convertible, subject to certain
conditions, into cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock, at our option. The initial conversion rate for the notes
will be 11.9021 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is equal to an
initial conversion price of approximately $84.02 per share. A holder of the
notes may surrender their notes at their option any time prior to the close of
business on the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2016, only under the
following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the
calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2011 (and only during such calendar
quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on
each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any
ten consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the
trading price, as defined, of the notes for each trading day of the measurement
period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our
Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we elect
to issue to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock any rights,
options, or warrants (other than pursuant to a rights plan) entitling them for a
period of not more than 60 calendar days after the record date for such
issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our Common Stock, at a price
per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of our Common
Stock for the ten consecutive day period ending on, and including, the trading
day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance; (iv) upon
specified distributions to our shareholders; or (v) upon the occurrence of
specified corporate transactions, such as a fundamental change (i.e., a change
in control), or our Common Stock ceasing to be listed on at least one U.S.
national securities exchange. On or after July 1, 2016, holders may convert their notes at
the conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second
scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date irrespective of
the foregoing conditions. In the event that a fundamental change, as defined in
the indenture under which the notes have been issued, occurs prior to maturity
of the notes, the initial conversion rate may be increased to include additional
shares upon conversion, or holders can require us to purchase from them all or a
portion of their notes for 100% of the principal value plus any accrued and
unpaid interest. 
    
In connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes, we
entered into convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with
multiple counterparties, including an affiliate of the initial purchaser. The
convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution
adjustments, the number of shares of our Common Stock that initially underlie
the notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the
conversion feature of the notes. The convertible note hedge will terminate upon
the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no
longer outstanding. The warrant transactions have an initial strike price of
approximately $103.41 per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of our
Common Stock, at our option. The warrants expire at various dates during 2017.

     The net
proceeds from the convertible senior notes offering were $391.1 million after
deducting the initial purchaser's discount and issuance costs. In addition, the
net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, after taking into account
the proceeds received by us from the warrant transactions, was $23.7 million. We
intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the notes for
general corporate purposes. 
Funding Requirements

    
We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements for our
research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical
testing). As described above, research and development expenses that we incur in
connection with our ZALTRAP® and antibodies collaborations are
generally funded by Sanofi. In addition, as described above, we and Bayer
HealthCare share agreed-upon development expenses that both companies incur in
connection with our EYLEA® collaboration. After taking into account
anticipated reimbursements from our collaborators, we currently estimate that
approximately 40-50% of our funding requirements for 2012 will be directed
toward technology development, basic research and early preclinical activities,
and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. For
2012, we also currently estimate that approximately 20-25% of our funding
requirements will be directed toward the planned commercialization of new
indications for our marketed products and ZALTRAP®; approximately
15-20% of our funding requirements will be applied to capital expenditures (as
described above); and the remainder of our funding requirements will be used for
general corporate purposes. 
    
In connection with our funding requirements, the following table
summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011. These
obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent
expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to
change:

Consists of $400.0
      million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes that
      mature on October 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The
      amounts in the table above assume the payment of interest on our
      convertible senior notes through their maturity date and the payment of
      the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date. Interest on the
      notes is payable semi-annually. The convertible senior notes will be
      convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our
      Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at our
      option.

Excludes future
      contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses.
      In 2011, these costs were $9.3 million. See Note 12(a) to our Financial
      Statements.


(3)

Purchase obligations
      primarily relate to (i) research and development commitments, including
      those related to clinical trials, (ii) capital expenditures for equipment
      acquisitions, and (iii) license payments. Our obligation to pay certain of
      these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events.
      Open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the
      ordinary course of business are excluded from the table
above.


(4)

Represents payments
      with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of
      facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above. See Note 12(a) to
      our Financial Statements.
    
Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, over the next several
years we and Bayer HealthCare will share agreed-upon EYLEA®
development expenses incurred by both companies, under a global development
plan, as described above. In addition, under our collaboration agreements with
Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable,
we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse Sanofi and Bayer
HealthCare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development
expenses incurred by Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, respectively. Profitability
under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net
sales less agreed-upon expenses. These reimbursements would be deducted from our
share of the collaboration profits (and, for our ZALTRAP®
collaboration with Sanofi, royalties on product sales in Japan) otherwise
payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a
faster rate. Given the uncertainties related to drug development (including the
development of ZALTRAP® and co-developed antibody candidates in
collaboration with Sanofi and EYLEA® in collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare), such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop
a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for
commercialization, we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our
collaborations with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare will become profitable.

73


     The amount we
need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from
net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of
our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, and the
timing thereof, the status of competitive products, the success of our research
and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional
and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual
property rights (and pending or future litigation related thereto), the delay or
failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the
continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations with Sanofi and Bayer
HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size
and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial
investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product
candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other
expenses. The amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs
depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and
early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results
of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to
initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as
described above. Our commercialization costs over approximately the next few
years will depend on, among other things, whether or not new indications for our
marketed products or our late-stage product candidates receive regulatory
approval, the market potential for such new indications or product candidates,
and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable
(whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our
collaborators). Currently, we are required to pay royalties on product sales of
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD and ARCALYST® for the
treatment of CAPS. In the future, if we are able to successfully develop,
market, and sell EYLEA® or ARCALYST® for other
indications, or certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay
royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or
collaboration agreements. 
    
We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and
enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be
substantial.
    
We believe that our existing capital resources, together with funds
generated by anticipated EYLEA® net product sales and funding we are
entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet
our projected operating needs. However, this is a forward-looking statement
based on our current operating plan, and there may be a change in projected
revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly
before such time. For example, in connection with preparing to commercialize and
launch potential products that are not licensed to a third party, we could incur
substantial pre-marketing and commercialization expenses that could lead us to
consume our cash at a faster rate. If there is insufficient capital to fund all
of our planned operations and activities, we anticipate that we would (i) seek
sources of additional capital through collaborative arrangements and/or
additional public or private financing, including debt and equity financing
and/or (ii) prioritize available capital to fund selected preclinical and
clinical development programs and/or preparations for the potential
commercialization of our late-stage product candidates, or license selected
products.
    
Other than letters of credits totaling $4.2 million, including the $3.4
million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in
Tarrytown, New York, as described above, we have no off-balance sheet
arrangements. In addition, we do not guarantee the obligations of any other
entity. As of December 31, 2011, we had no other established banking
arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing or a line of
credit. In October 2011, we completed a private placement of convertible senior
notes, as described above. In addition, in October 2010, we filed a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 registering the sale, in one or more
offerings, of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities, together or
separately, and our October 2010 public offering of approximately 6.3 million
shares of Common Stock was completed under this shelf registration statement.
There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete any additional
offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional
financing include our progress in product development and commercialization,
investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of the financial
markets. We may not be able to secure additional funding
through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital
requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our
research and development activities or future operations. This could materially
harm our business.

Future Impact of Recently Issued
Accounting Standards
Fees paid to the federal
government by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
     In December
2010, the FASB provided authoritative guidance on how pharmaceutical
manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income statement annual
fees mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. This guidance became effective
for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010. The adoption of this
guidance did not have an impact on our financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2011, and we do not anticipate that this guidance will have a
material impact on our financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2012, since (i) ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS, has been
approved as an orphan drug and orphan drugs are not subject to this annual fee
and (ii) EYLEA® received regulatory approval from the FDA, and was
launched, in November 2011.
Presentation of comprehensive
income 
    
In June 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on the
presentation of comprehensive income. Under the amendment, an entity will have
the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net
income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single
continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive
statements. This amendment, therefore, eliminates the currently available option
to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement
of changes in stockholders' equity. The amendment does not change the items that
must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other
comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. We will adopt this
amended guidance for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. As this guidance
relates to presentation only, the adoption of this guidance will not have any
other effect on our financial statements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk 
    
Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in
interest rates, principally in connection with our investments in marketable
securities, which consist primarily of direct obligations of the U.S. government
and its agencies, other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, and
money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We do not believe
we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our current
policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure
to interest rate changes. We estimate that a one percent unfavorable change in
interest rates would have resulted in approximately a $1.4 million and $5.9
million decrease in the fair value of our unrestricted investment portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in interest rate risk
year over year is due primarily to lower balances of marketable debt securities
with maturities in excess of one year that we held at December 31, 2011 compared
to 2010. 
Credit Quality Risk 
    
We have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable
investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and
concentration and diversification. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit
quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the
risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security. We
have recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain
marketable securities of $0.1 million in 2010 and 2009. During 2011, we did not
recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges.
    
We are also subject to credit risk in connection with accounts receivable
from our product sales of EYLEA® and ARCALYST®. Our
marketed products are sold in the United States, and related accounts receivable
are due from three distributors and several specialty pharmacies, who are our
customers. We have contractual payment terms with each of
our customers. We monitor our customers financial performance and credit
worthiness so that we can properly assess and respond to any changes in their
credit profile. During 2011, 2010, and 2009 we did not recognize any charges for
write-offs of accounts receivable related to our marketed products.

information required by this Item is included at page F-38 of this
report.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements
with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
     Not applicable. 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 
    
The Companys management, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of such period, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a
timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management,
including the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 
    
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
using the framework in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. The effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
    
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
    
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 
76


    
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met
and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the
company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risks that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders ofRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:
In our opinion, the
accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (the Company), at
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions. 
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

REGENERON
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and
2009(Unless otherwise
noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)
1. Organization and Business
     Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company or Regeneron) was
incorporated in January 1988 in the State of New York. The Company is a fully
integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops,
manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical
conditions. In 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Companys first commercial drug product,
ARCALYST® (rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the
treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). In November 2011,
the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA®
(aflibercept) Injection for the treatment of neovascular wet age-related macular
degeneration (wet AMD). The Company's facilities are primarily located in New
York. The Companys business is subject to certain risks including, but not
limited to, uncertainties relating to conducting pharmaceutical research,
obtaining regulatory approvals, commercializing products, and obtaining and
enforcing patents.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
     For purposes
of the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.
Marketable
Securities
     The Company
has an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment
securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and
diversification. The Company has invested its excess cash primarily in direct
obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities
guaranteed by the U.S. government, and money market funds that invest in U.S.
government securities. The Company considers its marketable securities to be
available-for-sale, as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These assets are carried at fair
value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. If
the decline in the value of a marketable security in the Companys investment
portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the
security to its current fair value and recognizes a loss as a charge against
income. As described under Use of Estimates below, the Company reviews its
portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative
factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary.
Accounts Receivable -
Trade
     The Companys
trade accounts receivable represents amounts due from its distributors and
specialty pharmacies (collectively, the Companys customers), which are all
located in the United States. The Company monitors the financial performance and
credit worthiness of its large customers so that it can properly assess and
respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company provides reserves
against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from a customers
inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against
the reserve. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no reserves against
trade accounts receivable. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, no trade accounts receivable were written-off.
Inventory
     Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. The Company
determines the cost of inventory using the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method.
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Companys products
prior to regulatory approval when, based on managements judgment, future
commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is
expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and
development. The Company periodically analyzes its inventory levels to identify
inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess
of its estimated realizable value, and writes-down such inventories as
appropriate. In addition, the Companys products are subject to strict quality
control and monitoring which the Company performs throughout the manufacturing
process. If certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality
specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, the Company records a
charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its
estimated realizable value.

REGENERON
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)(Unless
otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)
Property, Plant, and
Equipment 
     Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to
expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of
assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or
loss is recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of property, plant,
and equipment are as follows:



Building and improvements
10-40 years

Laboratory and other equipment
3-10
      years

Furniture and fixtures
5 years
     Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the lease term, without assuming renewal features,
if any, are exercised. Costs of construction of certain long-lived assets
include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life
of the related asset.
Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
     The Company
periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property,
plant, and equipment, and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist if estimated future
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount. For all periods
presented, no impairment losses were recorded.
Patents
     As a result
of the Companys research and development efforts, the Company obtains and
applies for patents to protect proprietary technology and inventions. All costs
associated with patents for product candidates under development are expensed as
incurred. Patent costs related to commercial products are capitalized and
amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining
patent term. To date, the Company has no capitalized patent costs.
Operating
Leases 
     On certain of
its operating lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other
incentives. The Company recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line
basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that
defer the commencement date of required payments. In addition, lease incentives
that the Company receives are treated as a reduction of rent expense over the
term of the related agreements.
Revenue
Recognition
a. Collaboration
Revenue
     The Company
earns collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to
develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize the Companys
technology platforms. The terms of these agreements typically include
non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone)
payments, and payments for development activities. Non-refundable up-front
license payments, where continuing involvement is required of the Company, are
deferred and recognized over the related performance period. The Company
estimates its performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement,
and adjusts the performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable
facts and circumstances. Although the Company did not enter into, or materially
modify, any collaboration arrangements with multiple-deliverables during the
year ended December 31, 2011, any future arrangements with multiple deliverables
will be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the
arrangement meet certain criteria, including whether the delivered item or items
has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis. Payments which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone,
involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is
achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
future service obligation associated with that milestone. Substantive
performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the
development life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as completion of
clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and receipt of
approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is deemed to
be a substantive performance milestone, the Company takes into consideration (i)
the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) the
Companys performance and relative level of effort required to achieve the
milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and
(iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of
the deliverables and payment terms. Payments for achieving milestones which are
not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related
performance period.
F-8


REGENERON
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)(Unless
otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)
     The Company enters into collaboration agreements that include varying
arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and
development activities. The Company may share the costs of
research and development activities with a collaborator, such as in the
Companys EYLEA® collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC, or the
Company may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of the
Companys research and development activities, such as in the Companys
ZALTRAP® (aflibercept)
and antibody collaborations with Sanofi. The Company records its internal and
third-party development costs associated with these collaborations as research
and development expenses. When the Company is entitled to reimbursement of all
or a portion of the research and development expenses that it incurs under a
collaboration, the Company records those reimbursable amounts as collaboration
revenue proportionately as the Company recognizes its expenses. If the
collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both the Company and its
collaborator perform development work and share costs, in periods when the
Companys collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the
collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as additional research
and development expense, the portion of the collaborators development expenses
that the Company is obligated to reimburse. In certain cases, the Company may
also share the costs of pre-launch commercialization activities with its
collaborators. The Company records its share of these costs as a reduction of
collaboration revenue.
     In connection
with non-refundable licensing payments, the Companys performance period
estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and
results of its research and development activities. Due to the variability in
the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product,
changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the
ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization,
revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and
could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year
in the future. In addition, estimated performance periods may change if
development programs encounter delays, or the Company and its collaborators
decide to expand or contract the clinical plans for a drug candidate in various
disease indications. Also, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in
accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company would recognize any
unamortized remainder of an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time
of the termination.
b. VelocImmune® Technology Licensing
     The Company
enters into non-exclusive license agreements with third parties that allow the
third party to utilize the Companys VelocImmune® technology in its internal research programs. The terms of these
agreements include up-front payments and entitle the Company to receive
royalties on any future sales of products discovered by the third party using
the Companys VelocImmune®
technology. Up-front payments
under these agreements, where continuing involvement is required of the Company,
are deferred and recognized ratably over their respective license
periods.
c. Product Revenue

     Product sales
consist of U.S. sales of the Companys two marketed products, EYLEA®
and ARCALYST®. Revenue from product sales is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated
risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable,
collection from the customer is reasonably assured, the Company has no further
performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. The Companys
written contracts with its customers stipulate product is shipped freight on
board destination (FOB destination). The Company records revenue from product
sales upon delivery to its customers.
     The Company
sells EYLEA® in the United States to three distributors and several
specialty pharmacies. The Company sells ARCALYST® in the United
States to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the
distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of
product. For EYLEA®, the distributors and specialty
pharmacies generally sell the product directly to
healthcare providers; whereas for ARCALYST®, the specialty pharmacies
sell the product directly to patients.
F-9


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     Revenue from
product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay
discounts, rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs (including
Medicaid), product returns, distribution-related fees, and other sales-related
deductions. Calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. The
Company reviews its estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable
provisions each period and records any necessary adjustments in the current
periods net product sales.
     Prompt
Pay Discounts:  No prompt pay discounts are currently  offered to the
Companys customers on sales of EYLEA®. In connection  with sales of ARCALYST®, the
Company offers discounts to its  customers for prompt payments. The Company estimates these discounts based on  customer
terms and historical experience, and expects that its customers will  always take advantage of this discount. Therefore, the
Company accrues 100% of  the prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each ARCALYST® invoice,
at the time of sale.
    
The Companys accrual for prompt pay discounts was not material at
December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
     Government Rebates and Chargebacks:
The Company estimates reductions to product
sales for Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) programs, and for certain
other qualifying federal and state government programs. Based upon the Companys
contracts with government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to
government-funded programs, historical experience, and, in the case of
EYLEA®, estimated payer mix based on third-party market research
data, the Company estimates and records an allowance for rebates and
chargebacks. The Companys liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates
for claims that a state will make for a current quarter, claims for prior
quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received,
and invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid.
The Companys reserves related to discounted pricing offered to VA, Public
Health Services (PHS), and other institutions (collectively, qualified
healthcare providers) represent the Companys estimated obligations resulting from
contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at
prices lower than the list prices the Company charges to its customers (i.e.,
distributors and specialty pharmacies). The Companys customers charge the
Company for the difference between what they pay for the products and the
ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. The Companys
reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified
healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already
claimed.
    
The Companys government rebate and chargeback accruals were $0.6 million
at December 31, 2011, which was based on a percentage of gross sales. Government
rebate and chargeback accruals were not material at December 31, 2010.

     Product Returns: Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers its
customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from the Company,
which is principally based upon the products expiration date. The Company will
accept returns for three months prior to and up to six months after the product
expiration date. Product returned is generally not resalable given the nature of the Companys products and method of administration. The Company develops estimates for
product returns based upon historical experience, inventory levels in the
distribution channel, and other relevant factors.
    
The Company has developed estimates for EYLEA® product
returns, based on several factors, including (i) the Companys historical
experience to date, and the Companys expectation, that its customers will not
stock significant supplies of EYLEA® due to contractual limitations
and other mitigating circumstances, (ii) historical industry information
regarding product return rates for similar specialty products, and (iii) the
shelf life of the product. Estimates for ARCALYST® product returns
have been developed based primarily on historical returns experience; to date,
actual ARCALYST® product returns have been negligible. The Company
monitors product supply levels in the distribution channel, as well as sales by
its customers of EYLEA® to healthcare providers and
ARCALYST® to patients using product-specific data provided by its
customers. If necessary, the Companys estimates of product returns may be
adjusted in the future based on actual returns experience, known or expected
changes in the marketplace, or other factors.
    
The Companys product returns accruals were not material at December 31,
2011 and 2010. 
     Distribution-Related Fees:
The Company has written contracts with its
customers that include terms for distribution-related fees. The Company
estimates and records distribution and related fees due to its customers based
on a percentage of gross sales. The Companys accrual for distribution-related
fees was $1.5 million at December 31, 2011. The Companys accrual for
distribution-related fees at December 31, 2010 was not material.

insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, and general support services.
All costs associated with research and development are expensed.
    
Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and
development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors.
The Company outsources a substantial portion of its clinical trial activities,
utilizing external entities such as contract research organizations (CROs),
independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to
assist the Company with the execution of its clinical studies. For each clinical
trial that the Company conducts, certain clinical trial costs are expensed
immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total
number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial,
and/or the period over which clinical investigators or CROs are expected to
provide services.
    
Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other
administrative functions to manage the Companys clinical trials are performed
primarily by CROs. CROs typically perform most of the start-up activities for
the Companys trials, including document preparation, site identification,
screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management.
On a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total
contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly
wider, as many of the Companys contracts with CROs are either expanded or
reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the
particular trial may not change materially. These start-up costs usually occur
within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in
nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring
and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the
individual contract or study. In the event of early termination of a clinical
trial, the Company accrues and recognizes expenses in an amount based on its
estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding
down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.
    
For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a
per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, the Company
accrues expense on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject
enrollment and activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense
recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and
progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter,
the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually
enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved
in the study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates
are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large
number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span
multiple years. During the course of a trial, the Company adjusts its rate of
clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from the Companys
estimates. The Companys estimates and assumptions for clinical expense
recognition could differ significantly from its actual results, which could
cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in
future periods when the actual results become known.
Stock-based
Compensation 
    
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for grants of
stock option awards and restricted stock under the Companys Long-Term Incentive
Plan to employees and non-employee members of the Companys board of directors
based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of
an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the awards
requisite service period. In addition, the Company has granted performance-based
stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain
performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements. Potential
compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these performance
options will be recognized only if, and when, the Company estimates that these
options will vest, which is based on whether the Company consider the options
performance conditions to be probable of attainment. The Companys estimates of
the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods. 
F-11



REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     The Company
uses the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option
awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with
respect to (i) expected volatility of the Companys Common Stock price, (ii) the periods
of time over which employees and members of the board of directors are expected
to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected
dividend yield on the Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates.
Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the
time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. This
estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates.
Income Taxes 
    
The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis
of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
(temporary differences) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which
the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established
for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    
Uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with FASB
authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in
which a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its
financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has
taken or expects to take on a tax return. Those positions, for which
management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability of
sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its
technical merits, are subjected to certain measurement criteria.
    
The Companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to
income tax matters in income tax expense. 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)

    
Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net income (loss)
adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on marketable securities,
net of any tax effect. Comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December
31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 have been included in the Statements of Stockholders
Equity. 
Concentration of Credit Risk

    
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities (see Note 6), and accounts receivable.
Per Share
Data 
    
Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on the basis
of the net income (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding during the period. Basic
net income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until vested.
Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares
of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding, and of common stock equivalents
outstanding when dilutive. Common stock equivalents include: (i) outstanding
stock options and restricted stock awards under the Companys Long-Term
Incentive Plans, which are included under the treasury stock method when
dilutive, (ii) Common Stock to be issued upon the assumed conversion of the
Companys convertible senior notes, which are included under the if-converted
method when dilutive, and (iii) Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of
outstanding warrants, which are included under the treasury stock method when
dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 does not include common stock equivalents,
since such inclusion would be antidilutive.

Risks and Uncertainties

     Developing and
commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. Before
revenues from the commercialization of the Companys current or future product
candidates can be realized, the Company (or its collaborators) must overcome a
number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development
and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in
other countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render the
Companys products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. The Company may
be subject to legal claims by third parties seeking to enforce patents to limit
or prohibit the Company from marketing or selling its products. The Company is
also dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants, collaborators,
and certain third-party suppliers, including single-source unaffiliated
third-party suppliers of certain raw materials and equipment. Regeneron, as
licensee, licenses certain technologies that are important to the Companys
business which impose various obligations on the Company. If Regeneron fails to
comply with these requirements, licensors may have the right to terminate the
Companys licenses. 
    
The Company has generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows
from operations since its inception. The Company received regulatory approval
from the FDA for ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS in February 2008
and EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011; however,
the Company has not generated significant sales or profits to date from these
two drug products. Revenues to date have principally been limited to (i)
up-front, license, milestone, and reimbursement payments from the Companys
collaborators and other entities related to the Companys development activities
and technology platforms, (ii) ARCALYST® and EYLEA®
product sales, (iii) payments for past contract manufacturing activities, and
(iv) investment income. Collaboration revenue in 2011 was earned from Sanofi and
Bayer HealthCare under collaboration agreements (see Note 3 for the terms of
these agreements). These collaboration agreements contain early termination
provisions that are exercisable by Sanofi or Bayer HealthCare, as
applicable.
Use of Estimates

    
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
which could have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements
include: 

Product rebates, chargebacks, and returns in connection with the
  recognition of product sales revenue.
Periods over which payments, including
  non-refundable up-front, license, and milestone payments, are recognized as
  revenue in connection with collaboration and other agreements to develop and
  commercialize product candidates and utilize the Companys technology
  platforms.  
Periods over which certain
  clinical trial costs, including costs for clinical activities performed by
  contract research organizations, are recognized as research and development
  expenses. 
In connection with the
  recognition of expense, using a blended royalty rate, related to the Companys
  non-exclusive license with Genentech, Inc. the Companys estimate of cumulative
  EYLEA® sales through May 7, 2016 (see Note 12b). 
In connection with stock
  option awards, (i) the fair value of stock options on their date of grant
  using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on assumptions with
  respect to (a) expected volatility of the Companys Common Stock price, (b)
  the periods of time for which employees and members of the Companys board of
  directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected
  lives), (c) expected dividend yield on the Companys Common Stock, and (d)
  risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
  securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives; (ii) the
  number of stock option awards that are expected to be forfeited; and (iii)
  with respect to performance-based stock option awards, if and when the
  options performance conditions are considered to be probable of
  attainment. 
The Companys
  determination of whether marketable securities are other-than-temporarily
  impaired. The Company conducts a review of its portfolio of marketable
  securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine, for
  securities whose current fair value is less than their cost, whether the
  decline in fair value below cost is other-than-temporary. In making this
  determination, the Company considers factors such as the length of time and
  the extent to which fair value has been less than cost, financial condition
  and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors,
  and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process
  also includes an evaluation of the Companys
  ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or their
  full value can be recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high
  degree of judgment.
Useful lives of property,
  plant, and equipment.
Inventory that may expire
  prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated
  realizable value, which is written-down, as appropriate. In addition,
  capitalization of inventory costs associated with the Companys products prior
  to regulatory approval when, based on managements judgment, future
  commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is
  expected to be realized.
The extent to which
  deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset by a valuation allowance.

     In addition,
the Companys share of EYLEA® development expenses incurred by Bayer
HealthCare, including the Companys share of Bayer HealthCares estimated
EYLEA® development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter, are
included in research and development expenses. The Bayer HealthCare estimate for
the most recent fiscal quarter is adjusted in the subsequent quarter to reflect
actual expenses for the quarter. Also, the Companys share of
ZALTRAP® pre-launch commercialization expenses incurred by Sanofi,
including the Companys share of Sanofis estimated ZALTRAP®
pre-launch commercialization expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter, are
included as a reduction of Sanofi collaboration revenue. The Sanofi estimate for
the most recent fiscal quarter is adjusted in the subsequent quarter to reflect
actual expenses for the quarter. 
Impact of Recently Issued
Accounting Standards 
Multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements 
    
During the first quarter of 2011 the Company adopted amended
authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements. The amended guidance provides greater ability to separate and
allocate consideration to be received in a multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangement by requiring the use of estimated selling prices to allocate the
consideration, thereby eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation.
The amended guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative
disclosures surrounding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The Company
is applying this amended guidance prospectively for new or materially modified
arrangements, of which there were none during the year ended December 31, 2011;
therefore, the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys
financial statements.
Milestone method of revenue
recognition 
    
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company adopted amended
authoritative guidance issued by the FASB codifying the milestone method of
revenue recognition as an acceptable revenue recognition model when a milestone
is deemed to be substantive. The Company earns substantive performance milestone
payments in connection with its collaboration agreements to develop and
commercialize product candidates with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare. Descriptions
of these collaboration agreements, including various financial terms and
conditions, are provided in Note 3. Since the Company has historically accounted
for milestones under the milestone method, the adoption of this guidance did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Fees paid to the federal government
by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
    
In December 2010, the FASB provided authoritative guidance on how
pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income
statement annual fees mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. This guidance
became effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010. The
adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, since (i) ARCALYST®
for the treatment of CAPS, has been approved as an orphan drug and orphan drugs
are not subject to this annual fee and (ii) since EYLEA® received
regulatory approval from the FDA, and was launched, in November 2011.
Presentation of comprehensive income

    
In June 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on the
presentation of comprehensive income. Under the amendment, an entity will have
the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net
income, and the components of other comprehensive
income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
separate but consecutive statements. This amendment, therefore, eliminates the
currently available option to present the components of other comprehensive
income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The
amendment does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive
income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net
income. The Company will adopt this amended guidance for the fiscal year
beginning January 1, 2012. As this guidance relates to presentation only, the
adoption of this guidance will not have any other effect on the Company's
financial statements.

Reclassifications

     Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform with the
current periods presentation.
3. Collaboration and Contract
Research Agreements 
    
The Company has entered into various agreements related to its activities
to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize its technology
platforms. Significant agreements of this kind are described below.
a. Sanofi
    
As described in Note 13, Sanofi has purchased a total of 15,816,953
shares of the Companys Common Stock, principally in connection with the
companies ZALTRAP® and antibody collaborations described below.
Total Company-incurred expenses associated with these Sanofi collaborations,
which include reimbursable and non-reimbursable amounts and an allocable portion
of general and administrative costs, were $318.2 million in 2011, $282.4 million
in 2010, and $209.4 million in 2009. 
    
ZALTRAP®
(aflibercept) 
    
In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement
(the ZALTRAP® Agreement) with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(predecessor to Sanofi U.S.), to jointly develop and commercialize
ZALTRAP®. In connection with this agreement, Sanofi made a
non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly
issued unregistered shares of the Companys Common Stock for $45.0
million.
    
In January 2005, the Company and Sanofi amended the ZALTRAP®
Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of aflibercept to the eye
(Intraocular Delivery) from joint development under the agreement, and product
rights to aflibercept in Intraocular Delivery reverted to Regeneron. In
connection with this amendment, Sanofi made a $25.0 million non-refundable
payment to Regeneron (the Intraocular Termination Payment). 
    
In December 2005, the Company and Sanofi amended the ZALTRAP®
Agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on
the development of ZALTRAP® to include Japan. In connection with this
amendment, Sanofi agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment
to the Company, which was received in January 2006. Under the ZALTRAP® Agreement,
as amended, the Company and Sanofi will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of ZALTRAP® outside of Japan, for disease indications
included in the companies collaboration. The Company is entitled to a royalty
of approximately 35% on annual sales of ZALTRAP® in Japan, subject to
certain potential adjustments. The Company may also receive up to $400 million
in substantive milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals,
including up to $360 million in milestone payments related to the receipt of
marketing approvals for up to eight ZALTRAP® oncology and other
indications in the United States or the European Union and up to $40 million
related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to five ZALTRAP®
oncology indications in Japan.
     Under
the ZALTRAP® Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by Sanofi. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of these development expenses, or half of $763.4 million as of December 31, 2011, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and Regenerons
share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regenerons option. Regeneron has the option
to conduct additional pre-Phase III studies at its own expense. In connection with the January 2005 amendment to the ZALTRAP®
Agreement, the Intraocular Termination Payment of $25.0 million will also be subject to 50% reimbursement by Regeneron
to Sanofi if the collaboration becomes profitable. In addition, if the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product in Intraocular
Delivery predates the first commercial sale of a ZALTRAP®
product under the collaboration by two years, Regeneron will begin reimbursing Sanofi for up to $7.5 million of ZALTRAP® development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial ZALTRAP®
sale under the collaboration occurs.
F-15



REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     Sanofi has the
right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months
advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason, Regenerons
obligation to reimburse Sanofi, for 50% of ZALTRAP® development
expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain all rights to
ZALTRAP®. 
    
In accordance with the Companys revenue recognition policy described in
Note 2, the up-front payments received in September 2003 and January 2006, of
$80.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, and reimbursement of
Regeneron-incurred development expenses, are being recognized as collaboration
revenue over the related performance period. In addition, in 2011, the Company
and Sanofi began equally sharing ZALTRAP®pre-launch
commercialization expenses under the ZALTRAP® Agreement. The
Companys share of these expenses was $9.3 million in 2011, which reduced
collaboration revenue in connection with the ZALTRAP®
Agreement.
    
The Company recognized $17.5 million, $26.4 million, and $36.5 million of
collaboration revenue in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, in connection with
the ZALTRAP® Agreement, as amended. In connection with the ZALTRAP®
Agreement, (i) at December 31, 2011, there was a net payable of $3.7 million to
Sanofi, (ii) at December 31, 2010, amounts receivable from Sanofi were $3.9
million, and (iii) deferred revenue at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $22.9
million and $32.6 million, respectively.
    
Antibodies 
    
In November 2007, the Company entered into a global, strategic
collaboration (the Antibody Collaboration) with Sanofi to discover, develop,
and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. In connection with the
collaboration, in December 2007, Sanofi purchased 12 million newly issued,
unregistered shares of the Companys Common Stock for $312.0 million (see Note
13).
    
The Antibody Collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical
Development Agreement (the Discovery Agreement) and a License and
Collaboration Agreement (the License Agreement). In connection with the
execution of the Discovery Agreement in 2007, the Company received a
non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from Sanofi. In addition, under
the Discovery Agreement, Sanofi is funding the Companys research to identify
and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal
antibodies against these targets. In November 2009, the Company and Sanofi
amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend the Antibody
Collaboration. Pursuant to the Discovery Agreement, as amended, Sanofi agreed to
fund up to $160 million per year of the Companys research activities in 2010
through 2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to adjust the maximum
reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over
the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied. In 2010, as
the Company scaled up its capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities,
Sanofi funded $137.7 million of the Companys preclinical research under the
amended Discovery Agreement. The balance between that amount and $160 million,
or $22.3 million, has been added to the funding otherwise available to the
Company in 2011-2012 under the amended Discovery Agreement. The amended
Discovery Agreement will expire on December 31, 2017; however, Sanofi has an
option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further
antibody development and preclinical activities. 
    
For each drug candidate identified under the Discovery Agreement, Sanofi
has the option to license rights to the candidate under the License Agreement.
If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with the
Company through product approval. Under certain defined circumstances, upon
exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, Sanofi must
make a $10 million substantive milestone payment to the Company. If Sanofi does
not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under
the License Agreement, the Company retains the exclusive right to develop and
commercialize such drug candidate, and Sanofi will receive a royalty on sales,
if any. The Company and Sanofi are currently co-developing seven therapeutic
antibodies under the License Agreement.
     Under
the License Agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement
are funded by Sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate,
subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs) are shared 80% by Sanofi
and 20% by Regeneron. If the Antibody Collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50%
of development expenses that were fully funded by Sanofi (or half of $582.3 million
as of December 31, 2011) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these
expenses and the Companys share of collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. However, the
Company is not required to apply more than 10% of its share of the profits from the antibody collaboration in any calendar quarter
to reimburse Sanofi for these development costs.
F-16



REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued) (Unless otherwise
noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
     Sanofi will
lead commercialization activities for products developed under the License
Agreement, subject to the Companys right to co-promote such products. The
parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United
States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding
scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (Regeneron) and ending at 55%
(Sanofi)/45% (Regeneron), and losses outside the United States at 55%
(Sanofi)/45% (Regeneron). In addition to profit sharing, the Company is entitled
to receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone
payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United
States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.
    
Regeneron is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply
clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the Antibody Collaboration
until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. In
connection with the November 2009 amendment of the collaborations Discovery
Agreement, Sanofi is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by
the Company to expand its manufacturing capacity at the Companys Rensselaer,
New York facilities, of which $28.2 million has been received or is receivable
at December 31, 2011.
    
With respect to each antibody product which enters development under the
License Agreement, Sanofi or the Company may, by giving twelve months notice,
opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which
event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development
and/or commercialization of the product. The Company may also opt-out of the
further development of an antibody product if it gives notice to Sanofi within
thirty days of the date that Sanofi enters joint development of such antibody
product under the License Agreement. Each of the Discovery Agreement and the
License Agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material
breach by the other party. Prior to December 31, 2017, Sanofi has the right to
terminate the amended Discovery Agreement without cause with at least three
months advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances,
Sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to the Company the full amount of
unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement
through December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the collaboration in its
entirety, the Companys obligation to reimburse Sanofi for development costs out
of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate. Upon
expiration of the amended Discovery Agreement, Sanofi has an option to license
the Companys VelocImmune® technology for agreed upon consideration.

    
In connection with the Antibody Collaboration, in August 2008, the
Company entered into a separate agreement with Sanofi to use Regeneron's
proprietary VelociGene® technology platform to supply Sanofi with
genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease (the
VelociGene® Agreement). The VelociGene® Agreement provides for minimum
annual order quantities for the term of the agreement, which extends through
December 2012, for which the Company expects to receive payments totaling a
minimum of $21.5 million.
    
In accordance with the Companys revenue recognition policy described in
Note 2, the (i) $85.0 million up-front payment received in December 2007, (ii)
reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred expenses under the Discovery and License
Agreements, (iii) $21.5 million of aggregate minimum payments under the
VelociGene® Agreement, and (iv)
reimbursement of agreed-upon costs to expand the Companys manufacturing
capacity are being recognized as collaboration revenue over the related
performance period. In connection with the amendments to expand and extend the
Companys antibody collaboration with Sanofi, during the fourth quarter of 2009,
the Company extended its estimated performance period related to the $85.0
million up-front payment received from Sanofi under the Discovery Agreement and
the $21.5 million of aggregate minimum payments under the VelociGene® Agreement. The effect of this
change in estimate resulted in the recognition of $5.3 million less in
collaboration revenue in both 2011 and 2010, compared to 2009.
    
In connection with the Antibody Collaboration, the Company recognized
$309.1 million, $284.9 million, and $210.7 million of collaboration revenue in
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
amounts receivable from Sanofi totaled $78.5 million and $75.7 million and
deferred revenue was $83.1 million and $84.0 million, respectively.

b. Bayer HealthCare
LLC 
     In October
2006, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer
HealthCare for the global development and commercialization outside the United
States of EYLEA®. Under the terms of the agreement,   Bayer
HealthCare made a non-refundable up-front payment to the Company of $75.0
million. In August 2007, the Company received a $20.0 million milestone payment
from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 study
of EYLEA® in the neovascular form of wet AMD. In July 2009, the
Company received a $20.0 million substantive milestone payment from Bayer
HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 study of
EYLEA® in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). In the fourth
quarter of 2010, the Company earned two $10.0 million substantive milestone
payments (for a total of $20.0 million) from Bayer HealthCare for achieving
positive 52-week results in the Phase 3 study of EYLEA® in wet AMD
and positive 6-month results in the Phase 3 study of EYLEA® in CRVO.
One of these $10.0 million payments was received in December 2010 and the other
$10.0 million payment was received in January 2011. The Company is eligible to
receive up to $50 million in future substantive milestone payments related to
marketing approvals of EYLEA® in major market countries outside the
United States. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $135 million in
sales milestone payments when and if total annual sales of EYLEA®
outside the United States achieve certain specified levels starting at $200
million.
    
The Company will share equally with Bayer HealthCare in any future
profits arising from the commercialization of EYLEA® outside the
United States. If EYLEA® is granted marketing authorization in a
major market country outside the United States and the collaboration becomes
profitable, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of
its share of the collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed upon development
expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of $370.9 million as of
December 31, 2011) in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and the Companys share
of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at the Companys option.
Within the United States, the Company is responsible for commercialization of
EYLEA® and retains exclusive rights to any profits from such
commercialization in the United States. 
    
Starting in 2009, all agreed upon EYLEA® development expenses
incurred by the Company and Bayer HealthCare, under a global development plan,
are being shared equally. The Company is also obligated to use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial product requirements.

    
Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the Bayer Agreement without
cause with at least six months or twelve months advance notice depending on
defined circumstances at the time of termination. In the event of termination of
the agreement for any reason, the Company retains all rights to
EYLEA®. 
    
The $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and the $20.0 million
milestone payment received in August 2007 from Bayer HealthCare are being
recognized as collaboration revenue over the related estimated performance
period in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition policy as described
in Note 2. In periods when the Company recognizes EYLEA® development
expenses that the Company incurs under the collaboration, the Company also
recognizes, as collaboration revenue, the portion of those EYLEA®
development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In periods when
Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon EYLEA® development expenses that
benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as
additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCares
EYLEA® development expenses that the Company is obligated to
reimburse.
    
The Company recognized $43.1 million, $75.4 million, and $67.3 million of
collaboration revenue from Bayer HealthCare in 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively. In both 2010 and 2009, collaboration revenue from Bayer HealthCare
included $20.0 million in milestone payments, as described above, which, for the
purpose of revenue recognition, were considered substantive. In addition, in
2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recognized as additional research and
development expense $47.8 million, $48.9 million, and $37.7 million,
respectively, of EYLEA® development expenses that the Company was
obligated to reimburse to Bayer HealthCare.
    
In connection with cost-sharing of EYLEA® expenses under the
collaboration, $4.5 million was receivable from Bayer HealthCare at December 31,
2011 and $2.3 million was payable to Bayer HealthCare at December 31, 2010. In
addition, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, deferred revenue from the Companys collaboration with Bayer HealthCare was $42.4 million and $47.0 million, respectively.

c. National
Institute of Health 
     In September
2006, the Company was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) as part of the NIHs Knockout Mouse Project. As amended, the NIH grant
provided a minimum of $25.3 million in funding over a five-year period,
including $1.5 million in funding to optimize certain existing technology,
subject to compliance with its terms and annual funding approvals, for the
Companys use of its VelociGene® technology to generate a collection of targeting vectors and
targeted mouse embryonic stem cells which can be used to produce knockout mice.
The Company records revenue in connection with the NIH grant using a
proportional performance model as it incurs expenses related to the grant,
subject to the grants terms and annual funding approvals. In 2011, 2010, and
2009, the Company recognized contract research revenue of $3.6 million, $4.6
million, and $5.5 million, respectively, from the NIH Grant. As of the end of
2011, no further revenue will be recognized by the Company in connection with
this NIH Grant. 
4. Technology Licensing Agreements

    
In March 2007, the Company entered into a six-year, non-exclusive license
agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. to allow Astellas to utilize the Companys
VelocImmune® technology in its internal research programs to discover human
monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas made a $20.0
million annual, non-refundable payment to the Company in each of 2010, 2009,
2008, and 2007. In July 2010, the license agreement with Astellas was amended
and extended through June 2023. Under the terms of the amended agreement,
Astellas made a $165.0 million up-front payment to the Company in August 2010,
which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized as revenue ratably over
the seven-year period beginning in mid-2011. In addition, Astellas will make a
$130.0 million second payment to the Company in June 2018 unless the license
agreement has been terminated prior to that date. Astellas has the right to
terminate the agreement at any time by providing 90 days advance written
notice. Under certain limited circumstances, such as a material breach of the
agreement by the Company, Astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a
refund of a portion of its up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after
June 2018, a portion of its second payment, to the Company under the July 2010
amendment to the agreement. The Company is entitled to receive a mid-single
digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas
using the Companys VelocImmune® technology. In
connection with the Astellas license agreement, for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recognized $22.0 million, $20.0
million, and $20.0 million of technology licensing revenue, respectively. In
addition, deferred revenue at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $151.7 million and
$173.7 million, respectively. 
    
In February 2007, the Company entered into a six-year, non-exclusive
license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to allow AstraZeneca to utilize
the Companys VelocImmune® technology in its internal research programs to
discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payment to the Company
in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Each annual payment was deferred and
recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing twelve-month
period. In November 2010, as permitted by the agreement, MedImmune Limited (as
successor by novation from AstraZeneca) gave written notice of voluntary
termination of the agreement, effective in February 2011, thereby canceling its
obligation to make either of the final two annual payments. Regeneron remains
entitled to receive mid-single digit royalties on any future sales of antibody
products discovered by MedImmune/AstraZeneca using the VelocImmune®
technology. In connection with the AstraZeneca license agreement, for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recognized $2.9 million,
$20.0 million, and $20.0 million, respectively, of technology licensing
revenue.
5. Product Revenue 
    
In November 2011, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA
for EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD. In accordance with the
Companys revenue recognition policy described in Note 2, the Company recorded
EYLEA® net product sales of $24.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2011. 
    
In February 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA
for ARCALYST® Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the treatment of
CAPS. ARCALYST® net product sales totaled $19.9 million, $25.3
million, and $18.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company had limited
historical returns experience for ARCALYST® beginning with initial
sales in 2008 through the end of 2009; therefore, ARCALYST® net
product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and
rebates could be reasonably estimated. Effective in the first quarter of 2010,
the Company determined that it had accumulated sufficient historical data to
reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of ARCALYST®. As
a result, ARCALYST® net product sales during 2010 included $20.5
million of net product sales made during this period and $4.8 million of
previously deferred net product sales. The effect of recognizing the previously
deferred ARCALYST® net product sales revenue was to lower the
Companys net loss per share by $0.06 in 2010.

6. Marketable Securities

     Marketable
securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of debt securities, as
detailed below, and equity securities. The aggregate fair value of the equity
securities was $3.0 million and $3.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, and the aggregate cost basis was $4.0 million at both December 31,
2011 and 2010. The Company also held restricted marketable securities at both
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, which consisted of debt securities, as
detailed below, that collateralize letters of credit and lease
obligations.
    
The following tables summarize the amortized cost basis of debt
securities included in marketable securities, the aggregate fair value of those
securities, and gross unrealized gains and losses on those securities at
December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company classifies its debt securities, other
than mortgage-backed securities, based on their contractual maturity dates.
Maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been estimated based primarily on
repayment characteristics and experience of the senior tranches that the Company
holds.

the Company computes the cost of its investments on a specific identification
basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to acquire the security, adjusted for
the amortization of any discount or premium.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     Marketable
securities included in Level 2 were valued using a market approach utilizing
prices and other relevant information, such as interest rates, yield curves,
prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates, generated
by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. The Company
considers market liquidity in determining the fair value for these securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, deterioration in the credit quality of
a marketable security subjected the Company to the risk of not being able to
recover the carrying value of these securities. As a result, the Company
recognized a $0.1 million impairment charge related to its Level 2 marketable
securities in 2010, which the Company considered to be other-than-temporarily
impaired. The Company did not record any charges for other-than-temporary
impairment of its Level 2 marketable securities in 2011 and 2009.
    
The Company held one Level 3 marketable security, which had a fair value
of $0 at December 31, 2011 and 2010. This Level 3 security was valued using
information provided by the Companys investment advisors and other sources,
including quoted bid prices which took into consideration the securities lack
of liquidity. In 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $0.1 million for
other-than-temporary impairment of this Level 3 marketable security; therefore,
as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of this security had been written down
to zero. There were no purchases, sales, or maturities of Level 3 marketable
securities and no unrealized gains or losses related to Level 3 marketable
securities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There were no
transfers of marketable securities between Levels 1, 2, or 3 classifications
during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

estimated useful lives of certain capitalized laboratory and other equipment,
which is a component of property, plant, and equipment,
were extended. The effect of this change in estimate was to lower depreciation
expense by $4.0 million and to lower the Companys net loss per share by $0.05
for the year ended December 31, 2010.

11. Convertible Debt 
     In October
2011, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875%
convertible senior notes (the Notes) in a private placement. The net proceeds
from the Notes offering were $391.1 million after deducting the initial
purchasers discount and issuance costs.
F-25



REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
    
The Notes will pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1,
beginning April 1, 2012, and will mature on October 1, 2016 unless earlier
converted or repurchased. The Notes will be convertible, subject to certain
conditions, into cash, shares of the Companys Common Stock, or a
combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at the Company's option. The
initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 11.9021 shares of Common Stock
(subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) per $1,000 principal amount of
the Notes, or a total of approximately 4,760,840 shares upon conversion, which
is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $84.02 per share. A
holder of the Notes may surrender their Notes at their option any time prior to
the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2016,
only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter
commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2011 (and only
during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Companys
Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the
conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business
day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the measurement
period) in which the trading price, as defined, of the Notes for each trading
day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last
reported sale price of the Companys Common Stock and the conversion rate on
each such trading day; (iii) if the Company elects to issue to all or
substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants
(other than pursuant to a rights plan) entitling them for a period of not more
than 60 calendar days after the record date for such issuance, to subscribe for
or purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock, at a price per share less than
the average of the last reported sales prices of the Companys Common Stock for
the ten consecutive day period ending on, and including, the trading day
immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance; (iv) upon
specified distributions to the Companys shareholders; or (v) upon the
occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a fundamental change
(i.e., a change in control), or the Companys Common Stock ceasing to be listed
on at least one U.S. national securities exchange. On or after July 1, 2016, holders may
convert their Notes at the conversion rate at any time prior to the close of
business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity
date irrespective of the foregoing conditions. In the event that a fundamental
change, as defined in the indenture under which the Notes have been issued,
occurs prior to maturity of the Notes, the initial conversion rate may be
increased to include additional shares upon conversion, or holders can require
the Company to purchase from them all or a portion of their Notes for 100% of
the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
     The Company
has reserved sufficient shares of its Common Stock to satisfy the conversion
requirements related to the Notes. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to
their maturity date.
    
In accordance with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other
options, the Company accounted for the liability and equity components of the
Notes separately. The estimated fair value of the liability component at the
date of issuance was $271.1 million, and was computed based on the fair value of
similar debt instruments that do not include a conversion feature. The equity
component of $120.9 million was recognized as a debt discount and represents the
difference between the $392.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of the
Notes and the $271.1 million estimated fair value of the liability component at
the date of issuance. The debt discount is amortized over the expected life of a
similar liability without the equity component. The Company determined this
expected life to be equal to the term of the Notes, resulting in an amortization
period ending October 1, 2016. The effective interest rate used to amortize the
debt discount is approximately 10.2%, which was based on the Companys estimated
non-convertible borrowing rate as of the date the Notes were issued.
    
Issuance costs of $0.9 million related to the issuance of the Notes were
allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation
of the proceeds and accounted for as capitalized debt issuance costs and equity
issuance costs, respectively.
    
The net carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes as of
December 31, 2011 consists of the following:

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per

     As of December
31, 2011, the "if converted value" did not exceed the principal amount of the
Notes since the closing sales price of the Companys Common Stock was less than
the initial conversion price of the Notes. The fair value of the outstanding
Notes was estimated to be $375.5 million as of December 31, 2011, and was
determined based on quoted market rates.
    
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into
convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with multiple
counterparties, including an affiliate of the initial purchaser. The convertible
note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,
the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that initially underlie the
Notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the
conversion feature of the Notes. The convertible note hedge will terminate upon
the earlier of the maturity date of the Notes or the first day the Notes are no
longer outstanding. The Company paid $117.5 million for the convertible note
hedge, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in
capital.
    
The warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately
$103.41 per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of the Companys Common
Stock, at the Companys option. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive
effect to the extent that the market price per share of the Company's Common
Stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. Proceeds received
from the warrant transactions totaled $93.8 million and were recorded as
additional paid-in capital. The warrants expire at various dates during 2017.

    
The convertible note hedge and warrants are both considered indexed to
the Companys Common Stock and classified as equity; therefore, the convertible
note hedge and warrants are not accounted for as derivative instruments. The
Company has reserved sufficient shares of its Common Stock to satisfy the
potential settlement of the warrants. 
12. Commitments and Contingencies

a. Leases 
    
Descriptions of Lease
Agreements 
    
The Company leases laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New
York, under a December 2006 lease agreement, as amended (the Tarrytown Lease).
The facilities leased by the Company under the Tarrytown Lease include (i) space
in previously existing buildings, (ii) newly constructed space in two new
buildings (Buildings A and B) that was completed in the third quarter of 2009
and, (iii) under a December 2009 amendment to the Tarrytown Lease, additional
newly constructed space in a third new building (Building C) that was
completed in the first quarter of 2011. The Tarrytown Lease will expire in June
2024 and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five
years each, escalations at 2.5% per annum, and early termination options for
various portions of the space exclusive of the newly constructed space in
Buildings A and B. The Tarrytown Lease provides for monthly payments over its
term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.
Certain premises under the Tarrytown Lease are accounted for as operating
leases. However, for Buildings A, B, and C that the Company is leasing, the
Company is deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlords buildings in
accordance with the application of FASB authoritative guidance, and the
landlords costs of constructing these new facilities are required to be
capitalized on the Companys books as a non-cash transaction, offset by a
corresponding lease obligation on the Companys balance sheet.
    
In connection with the Tarrytown Lease, the Company issued a letter of
credit in the amount of $3.4 million and collateralized the letter of credit
with cash and marketable debt securities totaling $3.6 million at both December
31, 2011 and 2010. Such collateral has been classified as restricted cash and
marketable securities. 
    
In October 2008, the Company entered into a sublease with Sanofi U.S. for
office space in Bridgewater, New Jersey. The lease commenced in January 2009 and
expired in July 2011. In July 2011, the Company entered into an operating lease
for office space in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, which expires in January
2017.
    
The Company also leases certain equipment under operating and capital
leases which expire at various times through 2014.

Company paid rental charges for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating
expenses of $9.3 million, $10.3 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
    
Commitments under
Capital Leases 
    
In 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into capital leases in connection
with acquisitions of new equipment. The lease obligations are collateralized
with marketable debt securities totaling $3.3 million and $3.5 at December 31,
2011 and 2010, respectively; such collateral has been classified as restricted
cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

At the end of the lease term, the Company is required to purchase the
leased equipment for a nominal amount defined in the lease agreement. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010, capital lease obligations totaled $2.5 million and
$2.8 million, respectively, and were included in other liabilities.
    
Facility Lease Obligations
    
As described above, in connection with the application of FASB
authoritative guidance to the Companys lease of office and laboratory
facilities in Buildings A, B, and C, the Company capitalized the landlords
costs of constructing the new facilities and recognized a corresponding facility
lease obligation. The Company also recognized, as additional facility lease
obligation, reimbursements from the Companys landlord for tenant improvement
costs that the Company incurred since, under FASB authoritative guidance, such
payments that the Company receives from its landlord are deemed to be a
financing obligation. Monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated
between the land element of the lease (which is accounted for as an operating
lease) and the facility lease obligation, based on the estimated relative fair
values of the land and buildings.
    
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had capitalized the landlords costs
of constructing Buildings A and B, which totaled $58.4 million, and of
constructing Building C, which totaled $27.8 million. Reimbursements from the
Companys landlord for Buildings A and B tenant
improvement costs totaled $56.9 million and were received by the Company during
2010 and 2009. Reimbursements for Building C tenant improvement costs totaled
$14.2 million and were received by the Company during 2010. With respect to
Buildings A and B, monthly lease payments commenced in August 2009, the
buildings were placed in service by the Company in September 2009, and the
imputed interest rate applicable to the Companys facility lease obligation is
approximately 11%. With respect to Building C, monthly lease payments commenced
in January 2011, the building was placed in service by the Company in February
2011, and the imputed interest rate applicable to the Companys facility lease
obligation is approximately 9%.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per

     In 2011, the
Company recognized $15.6 million of interest expense in connection with the
Buildings A and B and the Building C facility lease obligations. In 2010 and
2009, the Company recognized $9.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of
interest expense in connection with the Buildings A and B facility lease
obligation. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Buildings A and B facility lease
obligation balance was $113.0 million and $113.7 million, respectively, and the
Building C facility lease obligation balance was $47.5 million and $46.4
million, respectively.

b. Research Collaboration and
Licensing Agreements 
     As part of the
Company's research and development efforts, the Company enters into research
collaboration and licensing agreements with related and unrelated companies,
scientific collaborators, universities, and consultants. These agreements
contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and milestones to be
paid by the Company, services to be provided, and ownership rights to certain
proprietary technology developed under the agreements. Some of the agreements
contain provisions which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at
rates that range from 0.25% to 16.5%, in the event the Company sells or licenses
any proprietary products developed under the respective agreements.
    
In December 2011, the Company and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche
Group, entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement
(the Genentech Agreement) relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA® in
the United States. Pursuant to the Genentech Agreement, the Company received a
non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins,
known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents. The Davis-Smyth
patents are the subject of patent litigation between the Company and Genentech
now pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York.
Patent litigation is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the
Genentech Agreement (see Note 18).
    
Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, the Company agreed to make
payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA® commencing upon
FDA approval of EYLEA® in November 2011 through May 7, 2016. The
Company will be required to make a one-time, non-refundable $60 million payment
upon cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® reaching $400 million. In
addition, the Company agreed to pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales
of EYLEA® between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any
cumulative U.S sales of EYLEA® over $3 billion. As the Company
records net product sales of EYLEA®, the Company is recognizing
expense in connection with the Genentech Agreement using a blended mid-single
digit royalty rate that reflects both the $60 million payment and the royalties
payable on cumulative sales and that is based upon the Companys estimate of
cumulative EYLEA® sales through May 7, 2016.
    
The Company recognizes royalty expense based on net product sales of
EYLEA® and ARCALYST® under various licensing agreements,
including, for EYLEA®, the Genentech Agreement described above. For
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009,
royalties on net product sales totaled $3.2 million, $1.7 million, and $1.5
million, respectively, and are included in cost of goods sold.
F-29



REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     In July 2008,
the Company and Cellectis S.A. (Cellectis) entered into an Amended and
Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the Cellectis Agreement). The
Cellectis Agreement resolved a dispute between the parties related to the
interpretation of a license agreement entered into by the parties in December
2003 pursuant to which the Company licensed certain patents and patent
applications from Cellectis. Pursuant to the Cellectis Agreement, in July 2008,
the Company made a non-refundable $12.5 million payment to Cellectis (the
Cellectis Payment) and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty
based on revenue received by the Company from any future licenses or sales of
the Companys VelociGene® or VelocImmune® products and
services. No royalties are payable to Cellectis with respect to the Companys
VelocImmune® license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or the Companys
antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Moreover, no royalties are payable to
Cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from the Companys
VelocImmune® technology.
      The
Company began amortizing the Cellectis Payment in the second quarter  of 2008 in proportion to past and future anticipated
revenues under the  Companys license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and the Discovery and  Preclinical
Development Agreement under the Companys antibody collaboration  with Sanofi (as amended in November 2009). In 2011,
2010, and 2009, the Company  recognized $1.0 million, $0.9 million, and $2.3 million, respectively, of  expense in connection
with the Cellectis Payment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010,  the unamortized balance of the Cellectis Payment, which was
included in other  assets, was $5.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The Company estimates  that it will recognize
expense of $1.0 million in each of 2012 and 2013, and  $0.9 million in each of 2014, 2015,
and 2016, in connection with the Cellectis  Payment.
13. Stockholders
Equity 
    
The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for the
issuance of up to 40 million shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, and 160 million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share.
Shares of Class A Stock are convertible, at any time, at the option of the
holder into shares of Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class
A Stock have rights and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except that
each share of Class A is entitled to ten votes per share, while each share of
Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share. Class A Stock may only be
transferred to specified Permitted Transferees, as defined. Under the Companys
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Companys board of directors is
authorized to issue up to 30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined by the board of
directors. 
    
In September 2003, Sanofi purchased 2,799,552 newly issued, unregistered
shares of the Companys Common Stock for $45.0 million. See Note 3. 
    
In December 2007, Sanofi purchased 12 million newly issued, unregistered
shares of the Companys Common Stock for an aggregate cash price of $312.0
million. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, Sanofi entered into
an investor agreement with the Company, which was amended in November 2009.
Under the amended investor agreement, Sanofi has three demand rights to require
the Company to use all reasonable efforts to conduct a registered underwritten
public offering with respect to shares of the Companys Common Stock
beneficially owned by Sanofi immediately after the closing of the transaction.
Until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier
termination of the License and Collaboration Agreement, as amended in 2009,
under the Companys antibody collaboration with Sanofi (see Note 3) and the
Companys collaboration agreement with Sanofi for the development and
commercialization of ZALTRAP® (see Note 3), Sanofi will be bound by
certain standstill provisions. These provisions include an agreement not to
acquire more than a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of the
Companys Class A Stock and Common Stock. The percentage increased from 25% to
30% as of December 20, 2011. Under the amended investor agreement, Sanofi has
also agreed not to dispose of any shares of the Companys Common Stock that were

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data) 
     In October
2010, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6,325,000 shares
of Common Stock and received net proceeds of $174.8 million. Sanofi purchased
1,017,401 shares of Common Stock in this offering. 
    
In October 2011, the Company completed a private placement of $400.0
million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which are convertible into shares
of the Companys Common Stock. In accordance with accounting guidance for debt
with conversion and other options, the Company accounted for the liability and
equity components of the Notes separately. The equity component of the Notes was
$120.6 million, net of issuance costs. In connection with the offering of the
Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.
The Company paid $117.5 million for the convertible note hedge, which was
recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The warrant transactions
have an initial strike price of approximately $103.41 per share, and may be
settled in cash or shares of the Companys Common Stock, at the Companys
option. Proceeds received from the warrant transactions totaled $93.8 million
and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. The warrants expire at various
dates during 2017. See Note 11. 
14. Long-Term Incentive Plans

    
During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan which, as amended and restated (the 2000
Incentive Plan), provides for the issuance of up to 41,307,016 shares of Common
Stock in respect of awards. Employees of the Company, including officers, and
nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members of the Companys
board of directors, (collectively, Participants) may receive awards as
determined by a committee of independent directors (Committee). The awards
that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include: (a) Incentive Stock
Options (ISOs) and Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
(c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and (e) Other Awards.
    
Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase shares of
Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee; however, in the case of an
ISO, the option exercise price will not be less than the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a
period of time determined by the Committee, generally on a pro rata basis over a
three to five year period. The Committee also determines the expiration date of
each Option; however, no ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date
of grant. The maximum term of options that have been awarded under the 2000
Incentive Plan is ten years. 
    
Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted Common
Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a price determined by the
Committee. Such shares are nontransferable for a period determined by the
Committee (vesting period). Should employment terminate, as defined by the
2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the Restricted Stock, which has not
vested, will be transferred to the Company, except under defined circumstances
with Committee approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company requires a
return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the right to require a return of
all dividends paid on such shares. 
    
Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to receive, within
30 days of the date on which the share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares
of the Companys Common Stock as determined by the Committee, equal to the sum
of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date such share of
Phantom Stock vests and the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect
to a share of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the share of
Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests. Stock Bonus awards are
bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock which are granted at the discretion of
the Committee.

     Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on the
Companys Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan,
the terms and provisions of such Other Awards are determined solely on the
authority of the Committee. 
     The 2000 Incentive
Plan contains provisions that allow for the Committee to provide for the
immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the Company, as defined
in the plan. 
     As of December 31,
2011, there were 10,244,318 shares available for future grants under the 2000
Incentive Plan.

     The Company
satisfies stock option exercises with newly issued shares of the Companys
Common Stock. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2011,
2010, and 2009 was $49.2 million, $21.4 million, and $13.2 million,
respectively. The intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market
price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option.

     The Company grants
stock options with exercise prices that are equal to or greater than the average
market price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant (Market
Price). The table below summarizes the weighted-average exercise prices and
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options issued during the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. The fair value of each option granted under

PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)(Unless
otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data) 
     For the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recognized $39.2 million,
$29.4 million, and $27.4 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based
compensation expense related to non-performance based stock option awards. As of
December 31, 2011, there was $93.6 million of stock-based compensation cost
related to outstanding non-performance based stock options, net of estimated
forfeitures, which had not yet been recognized. The Company expects to recognize
this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
     In
addition, there were 2,195,429 performance-based options which were outstanding
and unvested as of December 31, 2011 of which, subject to the optionee
satisfying certain service conditions, 203,429 options that were issued in 2005
would vest upon achieving certain defined sales targets for the Companys
products and 1,992,000 options that were issued in 2011, 2010, and 2009 would
vest upon achieving certain development milestones for the Companys product
candidates. In light of the Companys receipt of marketing approval for
EYLEA® for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011, and the status
of the Companys development programs at December 31, 2011, the Company
estimates that all of the remaining performance-based options issued in 2005,
2009, and 2010 will vest and approximately 50% of the performance-based options
issued in 2011 will vest.
     For the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized $11.7 million and $8.1
million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to
these performance options. As of December 31, 2011 there was $17.4 million of
stock-based compensation cost which had not yet been recognized related to the
performancebased options that the Company currently estimates will vest. The
Company expects to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average
period of 2.5 years. In addition, potential compensation cost of $10.2 million
related to the performance options issued in 2011, whose performance conditions
(based on current facts and circumstances) are not currently considered by the
Company to be probable of attainment, will begin to be recognized only if and
when the Company estimates that it is probable that these options will vest. The
Companys estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest
will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. Changes in these estimates
may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in
future periods related to performance-based options.

exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors
option grants. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid
dividends and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
future. The risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives.

     The Company recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense
from Restricted Stock awards of $5.7 million, $2.4 million, and $2.2 million in
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there were 751,499
unvested shares of Restricted Stock outstanding and $9.8 million of stock-based
compensation cost related to these unvested shares which had not yet been
recognized. The Company expects to recognize this compensation cost over a
weighted-average period of 1.4 years. 
15. Executive Stock Purchase Plan 
     In 1989, the
Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan) under which
1,027,500 shares of Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards. The
Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of directors to award
employees, directors, consultants, and other individuals (Plan participants)
who render service to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a price
set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for the vesting of shares
as determined by the compensation committee and, should the Company's
relationship with a Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to
the original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total
of 983,254 shares were issued, all of which vested as of December 31, 1999. As
of December 31, 2011, there were 44,246 shares available for future grants under
the Plan. 
16. Employee Savings Plan 
     In 1993, the
Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k)
Savings Plan (the Savings Plan). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for
employees who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a percentage of their
compensation to be set aside to pay their future retirement benefits, as
defined. The Savings Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the Company to
make discretionary contributions (Contribution), as defined. The Company
recognized $4.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million of Contribution expense
in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, accrued
Contribution expense totaled $3.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively. During
the first quarter of 2012 and 2011, the Company contributed 63,937 and 91,761
shares, respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings Plan in satisfaction of
these obligations. 
17. Income Taxes
     For the year ended
December 31, 2011, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and
recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred taxes. In 2011, the
Company recognized a $1.1 million income tax benefit, consisting of (i) $0.7
million related to tax legislation that allowed the Company to claim a refund
for a portion of its unused pre-2006 research tax credits and (ii) $0.4 million
in connection with the net tax effect of the change in the Companys unrealized
gain (loss) on available for sale marketable securities, which is included in
other comprehensive income (loss).
     For the year ended
December 31, 2010, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and
recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred taxes. No provision or
benefit for income taxes was recognized by the Company in 2010. 
     For the year ended
December 31, 2009, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and
recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred taxes. In 2009, the
Company recognized a $4.1 million income tax benefit, consisting of (i) $2.7
million resulting from tax legislation that allowed the Company to claim a
refund of U.S. federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) that the Company paid in
connection with its 2007 U.S. federal income tax return, (ii) $0.7 million
resulting from tax legislation that allowed the Company to claim a refund for a
portion of its unused pre-2006 research tax credits on its 2009 U.S. federal
income tax return, and (iii) $0.7 million in connection with the net tax effect
of the Companys unrealized gain on available-for-sale marketable securities,
which is included in other comprehensive income in 2009.

     The Companys valuation allowance increased by $116.2 million in 2011,
due primarily to increases in the Companys net operating loss carry-forward and
tax credit carry-forwards and the full recognition of the $165.0 million
up-front payment received from Astellas in 2010 as taxable income in 2011. The
Companys valuation allowance increased by $63.0 million in 2010, due primarily
to increases in the net operating loss carry-forward and tax credit
carry-forwards.
     The Company is
primarily subject to U.S. federal and New York State income taxes. The
difference between the Companys effective income tax rate and the U.S federal
statutory rate of 35% is primarily attributable to an increase in the deferred
tax valuation allowance. In 2011 and early 2012, U.S. federal tax authorities
concluded examinations of the Companys 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal income tax
returns. The Companys 2010 federal income tax return is currently being
examined by the U.S. federal tax authorities. In addition, tax years subsequent
to 2007 remain open to examination by New York State tax authorities.
     As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the Company had no accruals for interest or penalties related to
income tax matters. 
     As of December 31,
2011, the Company had available for tax purposes unused net operating loss
carry-forwards of $800.2 million which will expire in various years from 2018 to
2031 and included $96.2 million of net operating loss carry-forwards related to
exercises of Nonqualified Stock Options and disqualifying dispositions of
Incentive Stock Options, the tax benefit from which, if realized, will be
credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company's research and experimental
and other tax credit carry-forwards expire in various years from 2012 to 2031.
Under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions, substantial
changes in the Companys ownership have resulted in an annual limitation on the
amount of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards that can be utilized
in future years to offset future taxable income. This annual limitation may
result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards
before utilization. 
     The following

and end of 2011 and 2010:

PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)(Unless
otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data) 
     In 2011, the gross
decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions was
primarily due to the conclusion of examinations of the Companys 2007, 2008, and
2009 federal income tax returns by U.S. federal tax authorities. In 2010, the
gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions
was primarily due to the Companys calculations of certain pre-2010 tax credits.
Due to the amounts of the Companys net operating loss carry-forward and tax
credit carry-forwards, the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related
to these unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, if recognized, would not affect the Companys
effective tax rate since the adjustments to deferred tax assets would be fully
offset by adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, income tax positions that were deemed uncertain under the
recognition thresholds and measurement attributes prescribed in FASB
authoritative guidance were not material.
18. Legal Matters 
     From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings in the
course of the Companys business. The Company does not expect any such current
ordinary course legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the
Companys business or financial condition. Costs associated with the Companys
involvement in legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.
Genentech Patent Litigation
     The Company is
aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by Genentech that
claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. The Company does not believe that
ZALTRAP® or EYLEA® infringe any valid claim in these
patents or patent applications. The Company is involved in five patent
litigations with Genentech, two in the United States and three in Europe. In
November 2010, the Company commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court), seeking a
declaratory judgment that no activities relating to the Companys VEGF Trap
infringe any valid claim of certain Genentech patents referred to as the
Davis-Smyth patents (the First Davis-Smyth Case). Genentech answered the
complaint and asserted counterclaims that the Companys prior or planned
activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will infringe claims of four
of the five Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment against the Company for
damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems
appropriate.
     On December 31,
2011, the Company entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement
Agreement with Genentech that covers making, using, and selling
EYLEA® in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human
eye diseases and disorders in the United States. Under the Genentech Agreement,
the Company received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and
certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Genentech
Agreement does not cover any non-U.S. patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes,
and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and
treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First
Davis-Smyth Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the
Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement provides for the Company to make
payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA® through May 7,
2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents expire. The Company will make a lump-sum
payment of $60 million once cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® reach
$400 million. The Company will also pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S.
sales of EYLEA® between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any
cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA® over $3 billion. As a result of the
Genentech Agreement, on January 17, 2012 Genentech filed a second amended answer
and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended its
counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the five Davis-Smyth patents. On
December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a related case in the Court against
Regeneron and Sanofi alleging infringement of four of the five Davis-Smyth
Patents by activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA®)
(the Second Davis-Smyth Case). As in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new
complaint Genentech requests a judgment against the Company for damages,
including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems
appropriate.
     The Company
believes Genentech's claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the Second Davis
Smyth Case are without merit and intend to continue to defend against all of
Genentechs remaining claims vigorously. As this litigation is at an early
stage, at this time the Company is not able to predict the probability of the
outcome or an estimate of loss, if any, related to these matters. 
     The Company has initiated
patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany, the United Kingdom, and
Italy, and may initiate other actions in other countries outside the United
States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially
harm its business and which, irrespective of the outcomes, may also entail
significant costs and expenses.

19. Net Loss Per Share Data 
     The Companys
basic net loss per share amounts have been computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding. Net loss per
share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and Class A
Stock outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic rights. In
2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company reported net losses; therefore, no common
stock equivalents were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share
since such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and
diluted net loss per share are as follows:
