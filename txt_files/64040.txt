Table of Contents
PART I 
Item 1. Business  Overview  The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the
Company, the Registrant, we, us or our) is a leading global information services provider serving the financial, education, commercial and commodities markets with the information they need
to succeed in the Knowledge Economy. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products, services and distribution channels, including digital data and information, integrated digital platforms, online via Internet Websites
as well as with printed books, magazines and newsletters, and conferences and trade shows.  On September 12, 2011, we announced that our
Board of Directors unanimously approved a comprehensive Growth and Value Plan as the culmination of a portfolio review begun in late 2010. One of the primary features of this plan is the separation of the enterprise into two public companies:
McGraw-Hill Financial, focused on content and analytics for financial markets, and McGraw-Hill Education, focused on education services and digital learning. On December 7, 2011, management provided an update on our Growth and Value Plan,
discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two independent companies. Highlighted actions included:   


 

 
 Reporting results for 2012 in five lines of business for the new McGraw-Hill Financial (S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices,
Commodities Markets, and Commercial Markets).   


 

 
 Reducing the McGraw-Hill Education workforce by 10% to create a flatter and more agile organization. 
 


 

 
 Freezing our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan as of April 1, 2012 and focusing our retirement program on market-competitive offerings.
  


 

 
 Repurchasing additional shares through a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction. 
Further information regarding these actions can be found in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.  We expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a tax-free
spin-off of the education business to the Companys shareholders, subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final Board approval and a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. 
Furthermore, on October 3, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement with The E.W. Scripps Company to sell the Broadcasting Group. The sale was
completed on December 30, 2011, when we received net proceeds of approximately $216 million. The divestiture of our Broadcasting Group, previously included in our Commodities & Commercial segment (previously named the McGraw-Hill
Information & Media segment), was carried out pursuant to our Growth and Value Plan discussed in further detail below. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the
Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010.
 Our Businesses  We have four
operating segments which have historically been named: Standard & Poors (S&P), McGraw-Hill Financial, McGraw-Hill Information & Media and McGraw-Hill Education (MHE). As part of our Growth and
Value Plan we have changed the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses going forward. S&P has changed to S&P Ratings, McGraw-Hill Financial has been changed to S&P Capital IQ /
S&P Indices, McGraw-Hill Information & Media has changed to Commodities & Commercial (C&C) and MHE has remained the same. Going forward, the new McGraw-Hill Financial will include S&P Ratings, S&P
Capital IQ / S&P Indices and C&C.  S&P Ratings  S&P Ratings is the world's foremost provider of credit ratings. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income
investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit
ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.  With offices in over 20 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors
with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions and access to the financial markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors; corporations; governments; municipalities; commercial and
investment banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.

Table of Contents
S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transactional and non-transactional. Transaction revenue
primarily includes fees associated with:   


 

 
 ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments; 
 


 

 
 bank loan ratings; and   


 

 
 corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of
a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.  Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees
for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.  Global
markets have begun to recover and some are expanding rapidly, particularly those in emerging economies such as China and India, and raising capital is essential for growth. Though some uncertainties do remain, individuals, countries, and
corporations will continue to require access to world capital markets, and investors will demand the diversification they offer. The primary risk point in the financial markets has moved to Europe. New financial legislation around the world will
help improve investor confidence and market stability.  S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices 
S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices is a leading global provider of digital and traditional research and analytical tools for investment advisors, wealth
managers and institutional investors. It deploys the latest innovative technology driven strategies to deliver to customers an integrated portfolio of cross-asset analytics, desktop services, valuation and index benchmarks and investment
recommendations in the rapidly growing financial information, data and analytics market. The key constituents S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices serves are asset managers; investment banks; investors; brokers; financial advisors; investment
sponsors; and companies back-office functions, including compliance, operations, risk, clearance, and settlement.  S&P Capital IQ /
S&P Indices differentiates its revenue between subscription and non-subscription. Subscription revenue primarily includes:   


 

 
 products in our Integrated Desktop Solutions Group, which include the following content: Capital IQ  a product suite that provides data and
analytics for global financial professionals, Global Credit Portal  a web-based solution that provides real-time credit research, market information and risk analytics, and TheMarkets.com  a real-time research offering featuring content
from the worlds leading brokers and independent research providers;   


 

 
 products in our Enterprise Solutions group, such as Global Data Solutions, which combines high-quality, multi-asset class and market data to help
investors meet the new analytical, risk management, regulatory and front-to-back office operations requirements;   


 

 
 investment research products in our Research & Analytics group; 
 


 

 
 and other data subscriptions.  Non-subscription revenue is generated primarily from products in our S&P Indices group, specifically through fees based on assets underlying exchange-traded funds; as well as certain advisory, pricing
and analytical services in our Integrated Desktop Solutions group.  The increasing interconnections among the world economies and financial
markets underpin the need for financial information. The retirement of the baby boomers in developed countries as well as the emergence of a vast new middle class in developing countries will also increase the need for financial services.
 Commodities & Commercial  C&C consists of business-to-business companies specializing in the commercial and commodities markets, each an expert in its industry, that deliver their customers access to actionable pricing
benchmarks, data and analytics. C&C includes such brands as Platts, J.D. Power and Associates, McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week. The Broadcasting Group has historically been part of the C&C segment and was sold on
December 30, 2011. In accordance with the presentation of the Broadcasting Group as discontinued operations, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change.  
Key markets served by C&C include professionals and corporate executives in automotive, aerospace and defense, construction, and energy; and global
business and financial professionals, traders, investors, marketers, advertisers, and consumers worldwide.  The global business is driven by
the need for information and transparency in a variety of industries, and to a lesser extent, by advertising revenue. C&C delivers critical information, largely through digital channels, for the energy, construction, aerospace and defense,
automotive, and general business markets. The recent recession has adversely affected the construction and automobile industries. These sectors are beginning to stabilize, but the rate of recovery is still unknown. Information is the main currency
of the new industrial age. Global information coverage and the interconnections in global trade and finance demand faster and more accurate information flows.

Table of Contents
McGraw-Hill Education  MHE is one of the premier global educational publishers and consists of two operating groups: the School Education Group (SEG), serving the elementary and high school (el-hi)
markets, and the Higher Education, Professional and International Group (HPI), serving the college and university, professional, international and adult education markets. As world economies become increasingly centered on the service
sector and technology and as the global population continues to rise, education is more than ever the key to growth.  The el-hi market is
changing with digital capabilities becoming increasingly critical. SEG sells textbooks and supplemental materials (in print, digital, and hybrid versions) and provides online and traditional assessment and reporting services. The key markets are
pre-kindergarten, elementary, secondary, testing, supplemental, vocational, and post-secondary fields in the United States. The market for textbooks consists of adoption states, which are states that provide educational funding to school districts
for specific programs based on adoption calendars, and open territory states, which are states that do not follow adoption calendars. This market is influenced strongly by the size and timing of state adoption opportunities and the availability of
funds in adoption states and in the open territory. Federal support has eased some of the pressure on state and local finances, which has helped to mitigate the cutbacks in K-12 education.  In the college and university market, and the international market, we sell integrated digital e-learning platforms, textbooks and other instructional resources for the broad range of higher education
disciplines. Key markets for higher education products are domestic and international colleges, universities, post-graduate institutions and English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. For the professional market, both in the United States and
internationally, we offer digital and print products in medicine, healthcare, engineering, science, computer technology, business, education and general reference.  The college and university market is affected by enrollments, higher education funding and the number of courses available to students. Enrollments in degree-granting higher education institutions are
projected to rise by 13% to 20.6 million by 2018, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. College enrollments are rising as more high school graduates perceive the need to bridge skills gaps with college-educated workers.
Continuing education is becoming more common, as workers may need to change careers several times over the course of a working lifetime. Reflecting these trends, online enrollments have continued to grow more rapidly than the total higher education
population. Internationally, postsecondary enrollments are also increasing in many regions, notably in India, China and other emerging economies.  Our Strategy  As discussed above, on September 12, 2011 we announced our Growth and
Value Plan which includes the creation of two independent companies: McGraw-Hill Financial, a world leader in content and analytics for financial and commodities markets, and McGraw-Hill Education, a global leader in education services and digital
learning. This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.  Four key trends are increasing the need for content and analytics
in the financial, commercial and commodities markets:   


 

 
 The globalization of the capital markets: the global demand for capital and commodities markets trading and liquidity is expanding rapidly in both
developed and emerging markets   


 

 
 The need for data-driven decision making tools: developments in technology, communications and data processing have increased the demand for
time-critical, multi-asset class data and solutions   


 

 
 Systemic regulatory change: new global legislation (e.g. Dodd-Frank, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Basel III) is creating new and
complex operating and capital models for banks and market participants   


 

 
 Increased volatility and risk: there is amplified uncertainty and market volatility around short-term events are driving the need for new methodologies
to measure risk, return and profitability  McGraw-Hill Financial 
In 2012, we plan to focus on the following strategies for our financial information businesses to capitalize on the above four trends: 
 


 

 
 Integrated Solutions: providing integrated solutions within and across market segments that fill evolving customer needs 
 


 

 
 Distribution: capturing additional revenue by leveraging and expanding our strong channel relationships 
 


 

 
 Geographic Penetration: using our vast global footprint to capitalize on opportunities in mature and growth markets 
 


 

 
 Scalable Capabilities: creating and leveraging efficiency and effectiveness through common platforms, processes and standards
  


 

 
 Continuing to pursue targeted acquisitions and alliances 
 


 

 
 Continuing cost-reduction initiatives 
  5 


Table of Contents
Integrated Solutions: providing integrated solutions within and across market segments that fill
evolving customer needs  We will build economies of scale that allow us to leverage and maximize the value of content and analytics
across all of our different businesses. This will result in the creation of innovative new solutions that help investors face the evolving challenges of todays volatile and changing market landscape. The growing need for investors to be able
to track price movements across all asset classes creates an existing and fast growing opportunity for us to deliver integrated solutions on commodities, fixed income, equity, credit, and funds that inform strategy and trade ideas on cash,
derivatives and volatility indices.  Distribution: capturing additional revenue by leveraging and expanding our strong channel
relationships  We will capture additional revenue by leveraging and expanding on our multi-channel distribution capabilities. We have
varied distribution channels which enable us to reach many different customers in many different ways with essential, high-value content. Our strategy is to own and commercialize high-quality brands and content and then distribute it to clients in
any fashion they wish.  Geographic Penetration: using our vast global footprint to capitalize on opportunities in mature and growth
markets  We will increase our global footprint and revenues by expanding upon and fully exploiting the many operational and strategic
synergies that exist among our brands, including overlapping customer bases, shared technology platforms, optimized access to global capital markets, and an international employee base active in growth markets. Our scale and leadership positions
will also enable us to capitalize on growth trends and extend our position in fast-developing emerging markets.  Scalable Capabilities:
creating and leveraging efficiency and effectiveness through common platforms, processes and standards  We will maximize the
capabilities of our entire portfolio of assets through an operating model that allows us to leverage infrastructure, and more quickly and effectively combine assets to create new solutions. This will allow us to create solutions that offer
high-value, differentiated offerings.  Continuing to pursue targeted acquisitions and alliances 
We will continue to pursue acquisitions and alliances that will expand our business and accelerate growth. 
 


 

 
 In November 2011, we announced an agreement with CME Group to establish a new joint venture in the rapidly growing index business. Under this
agreement, we will contribute our S&P Indices business and the CME Group/Dow Jones joint venture will contribute the Dow Jones Indices business to create S&P/Dow Jones Indices, a global leader in index services. S&P/Dow Jones Indices is
expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2012, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.   


 

 
 In July 2011, we acquired the issued and outstanding shares of Steel Business Briefing Group (the SBB Group), a privately held U.K. company
and leading provider of news, pricing and analytics to the global steel market. The SBB Group provides subscription-based, electronic products to the steel industry and its participants through two principal businesses, Steel Business Briefing and
The Steel Index. The SBB Group is included within Platts, part of our C&C segment.   


 

 
 In January 2011, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of Bentek Energy LLC (Bentek), which is included
as part of our C&C segment. Bentek offers its customers a comprehensive portfolio of data, information and analytics products in the natural gas and liquids sector. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to acquire Benteks knowledge,
skill and expertise in gathering high-quality detailed data and their ability to identify key relationships within the data critical to industry participants.  Continuing cost-reduction initiatives  We have made significant progress in 2011
towards our cost reduction goals to ensure that we will have appropriate cost structures to drive margin expansion and invest selectively in attractive growth opportunities. We reduced C&Cs workforce by approximately 100 positions and
Standard & Poors workforce by approximately 30 positions in 2011. We will continue to look to extend outsourcing efforts to enhance cost synergies and realign administrative support for a leaner overall cost structure. 
McGraw-Hill Education  In 2012,
we plan to focus on the following strategies for our education business:   


 

 
 Continuing to accelerate growth by aligning McGraw-Hill Educations key strengths with market forces 
 


 

 
 Continue to optimize resource allocation for long-term value 
  6 


Table of Contents
Continuing to accelerate growth by aligning McGraw-Hill Educations key strengths with market
forces  We will continue to accelerate growth by capitalizing on digital transformation, maintaining and growing
our leadership position in individualized learning; expanding international presence to meet the rising demand for education in global growth markets; enhancing capabilities to drive expansion in education services, digital delivery and global
growth; and supporting growth through acquisitions or partnerships. We will continue to reinvest resources into the creation of education services and digital products and solutions to better capitalize on growth opportunities in the education
market. In November 2011, we announced an agreement with New Oriental Education & Technology Group to form a joint venture company which will provide critical 21st century skills to students across China. The planned formation highlights McGraw-Hill Educations global
expansion in the English-language skills development and college and career readiness services market, as well as its highly advanced digital capabilities.  Optimize resource allocation for long-term value  We will continue to optimize
resource allocation to create long-term value. This means deploying capital as appropriate to support our growth strategy, developing an integrated and focused organizational structure, and rationalizing the cost structure to enhance efficiency. We
reduced McGraw-Hill Educations workforce by approximately 540 positions in 2011 to create a flatter more agile organization. We will continue to reduce costs and streamline McGraw-Hill Educations operational structure which will enable
it to aggressively pursue a strategy that focuses on high-growth opportunities in digital learning and education services. 
Uncertainties  There can be no
assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies. The following factors could unfavorably impact operating results in 2012:   


 

 
 Prolonged difficulties in the credit markets   


 

 
 A change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses 
 


 

 
 Lower educational funding as a result of state budget concerns 
 


 

 
 A change in educational spending   


 


 These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically. 
 


 

 
 We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which we
operate.   


 

 
 We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service
offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business
could be subject to significant disruption and our operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems. 
 


 

 
 We are in the process of migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. There can be no certainty that
these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to migrate successfully may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate
the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption.  A significant increase in operating costs
and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability   


 

 
 Our major expenses include employee compensation and printing, paper, and distribution costs for product-related manufacturing.
  


 
¡
 
 
 We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses.
Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require. 
 


 
¡
 
 
 We could experience changes in pension costs and funding requirements due to poor investment returns and/or changes in pension assumptions.
  


 
¡
 
 
 Paper prices fluctuate based on the worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for the specific types of paper used by us. Our overall paper
price increase is currently limited due to negotiated price reductions, long-term agreements, and short-term price caps for a portion of paper purchases that are not protected by long-term agreements. 
 


 
¡
 
 
 Our books and magazines are printed by third parties and we typically have multi-year service contracts for the printing of books and magazines in
order to reduce price fluctuations over the contract term.   


 
¡
 
 
 We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives as well as significant investments in the
development of programs for the el-hi market place. Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.
 Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position 
 


 

 
 Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated
results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary
rights in some jurisdictions and markets.  Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position
and results of operations   


 

 
 We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business practices, as discussed under Item 7, Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K and in Note 13  Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and

Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K, and face the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the
resolution of any particular legal proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Risk of doing business abroad   


 

 
 As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest
rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and
legal systems, and other factors. Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and/or expected operating results. 
Risks associated with the proposed spin-off transaction   


 

 
 Our previously announced tax-free spin-off is complex in nature and subject to various regulatory approvals, including a favorable letter ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. These factors could prevent the completion of or otherwise adversely affect or delay the proposed spin-off.
  


 

 
 Completion of the spin-off requires significant time, effort, and expense. Any delays in the anticipated completion of the spin-off may increase the
expenses which we incur to complete the transaction. The separated businesses could also face unanticipated problems in operating independently, and thus may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation. 
 


 

 
 If consummated, the spin-off will result in two separate independent public companies each of which will be a smaller, less diversified company than we
currently are with a narrower business focus than we currently have. In addition, diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows may diminish. As such, it is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing
requirements may be subject to increased volatility.   


 

 
 The spin-off transaction requires us to hire, retain and develop our senior management and a highly skilled workforce for two separate businesses. Any
unplanned turnover or our failure to develop current leadership positions or to hire and retain a skilled workforce could affect our institutional knowledge base and our competitive advantage. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty
about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spin-off transaction. In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees and higher
employee turnover.   


 

 
 In addition, we plan to outsource certain support functions to third-party service providers in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If
the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies,
the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or harm employee morale.  Risk Factors
Specific to S&P Ratings  Changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes
in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets could have a material impact on our results of operations   


 

 
 Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to
issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which S&P Ratings provides credit ratings.   


 

 
 Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic
events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being
offered.   


 

 
 A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 


 

 
 Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be
advocates of increased regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.  Increased competition or regulation could result
in a loss of market share or revenue   


 

 
 The markets for credit ratings are competitive. S&P Ratings competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors,
including the quality of its ratings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.   


 

 
 In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating
agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.

Table of Contents
Increased domestic and foreign regulation of the credit rating industry may adversely impact S&P
Ratings business   


 

 
 The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by
S&P Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
  


 
¡
 
 
 In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the SEC, the European Commission, through regulators including the International Organization of
Securities Commissions and the European Securities and Markets Authority, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the
activities of credit rating agencies.   


 
¡
 
 
 Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies from time to
time.   


 
¡
 
 We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
  


 
¡
 
 
 Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are
likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact
on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to S&P Ratings rating activities.

 Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.  Risk Factors Specific to S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices
 Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue 
 


 

 
 The markets for financial research, investment and advisory services are very competitive. S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices competes domestically
and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation.
  


 

 
 The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by
S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
  


 
¡
 
 
 We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
  


 
¡
 
 
 In the future, other laws, regulations and rules relating to financial information may be considered by local, national, foreign and multinational
bodies.

 Additional information regarding S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices is provided under Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.  Consolidation of customers could impact our
available markets and revenue growth   


 

 
 Our businesses within S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services
industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the
size of our customer base.  Risk Factors Specific to Commodities & Commercial 
Increased domestic or foreign regulation of the oil price reporting industry may adversely impact Platts business 
 


 

 
 In the fall of 2011, the G20 Cannes Final Summit Declaration called upon the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),
International Energy Forum, International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prepare recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of price reporting companies by mid-2012. 
 


 

 
 In a meeting with representatives of IOSCO in January 2012, principals at IOSCO advised Platts management that among the recommendations the regulatory
group is considering is establishment of formal oversight of price reporting organizations and their processes, or a self-regulatory oversight regime.   


 

 
 In addition, new rules that are expected to be adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2012 affecting transactions in oil
derivatives may implicate Platts in relation to its administration of the Platts electronic window (eWindow) as a means of determining price assessments in oil. Similar new rules and regulations in Europe are currently under consideration, albeit on
a slower time frame.

 We do not believe that any new regulatory or self-regulatory oversight regime, or any such new CFTC or other regulations or rules, would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Changes in the global automotive markets
  


 

 
 Declines in the global automotive industry impacts our ability to sustain or grow our revenue streams associated with business intelligence to that
market.  Risk Factors Specific to McGraw-Hill Education Segment 
Changes in educational funding could materially affect our education businesses 
 


 

 
 Our U.S. educational materials and testing businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in
federal or state legislation, changes in the state procurement processes and/or changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S. economy.   


 

 
 Although the elementary and high school education market has benefited over the last several years from programs funded under the No Child Left Behind
Act of 2002 and, more recently, from additional programs funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, future changes in federal funding and/or state or local tax bases could create an unfavorable environment for education
budgets, resulting in a decrease in educational spending.  Our education businesses operate in a cyclical environment
  


 

 
 A significant portion of our sales are to customers in educational markets. Our School Education Group and the industry it serves are influenced
strongly by the magnitude and timing of state adoption opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently conduct a state-level adoption process to review instructional materials, creating approved lists from which local school districts may select.
In the remaining states, known as open territories, instructional materials are selected and purchased independently by local districts or individual schools. There is no guarantee that our materials will be successful in the state new
adoption market or in open territories.  Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments 
None. 
Item 2. Properties  Our corporate headquarters are located in leased premises located at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020. We lease office facilities at 172 locations; 68 are in the United States. In addition,
we own real property at 14 locations, of which 6 are in the United States. The number of overall locations decreased from 2010 primarily due to the divestiture of our Broadcasting Group, which resulted in the loss of owned buildings and leased tower
sites. See Note 2  Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Significant Events under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K for further detail. Our properties consist primarily of
office space used by each of our segments. Our MHE segment also utilizes warehouse space and book distribution centers. We believe that all of our facilities are well maintained and are suitable and adequate for our current needs.

The Bank of New York Mellon's Shareowner Services business was acquired by Computershare on December 31, 2011. Shareholders should continue to contact BNY Mellon
as noted.  Repurchase of Equity Securities  On January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 45 million shares of the Companys common stock (the 2007 Repurchase
Program), which was approximately 13% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the third quarter of 2011, we completed the repurchase of such shares.  On June 29, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares (the 2011 Repurchase Program), which was
approximately 17% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we repurchased 18 million shares and, as of December 30, 2011, 24 million shares remained available under the 2011
Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. The 2011 Repurchase
Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.  On December 7, 2011 we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) with a financial institution to initiate share repurchases, aggregating $500
million. The first ASR Agreement was structured as an uncollared ASR Agreement in which we paid $250 million on December 12, 2011 and received an initial delivery of approximately 5 million shares subject to a 20%, or $50 million,
holdback. The second ASR Agreement was structured as a capped ASR Agreement in which we paid $250 million and received approximately 5 million shares representing the minimum number of common shares to be repurchased based on a calculation
using a specific capped price per share. Further discussion relating to our ASR Agreements can be found in Note 9  Equity to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the fourth quarter of 2011 pursuant to the 2011 Repurchase Program (column c). In addition to these
purchases, the number of shares in column (a) include: 1) shares of common stock that are tendered to us to satisfy our employees tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of restricted shares (we repurchase
such shares based on their fair market value on the vesting date), and 2) our shares deemed surrendered to us to pay the exercise price and to satisfy our employees tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise of employee stock
options. There were no other share repurchases during the quarter outside the repurchases noted below.

cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 2 of this report.  OVERVIEW 
We are a leading global information services provider serving the financial services, education, commercial and commodities markets with the information
they need to succeed in the Knowledge Economy. The commercial markets include automotive, construction, aerospace and defense, and marketing/research information services, while the commodities market includes energy. 
Our operations consist of four operating segments which have historically been named: Standard & Poors (S&P), McGraw-Hill
Financial, McGraw-Hill Information & Media and McGraw-Hill Education (MHE). As part of our Growth and Value Plan we have changed the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses
going forward. S&P has changed to S&P Ratings, McGraw-Hill Financial has been changed to S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices, McGraw-Hill Information & Media has changed to Commodities & Commercial (C&C)
and MHE has remained the same. Going forward, the new McGraw-Hill Financial will include S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices and C&C.   


 

 
 S&P Ratings is the world's foremost provider of credit ratings providing investors with information and independent ratings benchmarks for their
investment and financial decisions.   


 

 
 S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices is a leading global provider of digital and traditional research and analytical tools which integrate cross-asset
analytics, desktop services, and valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.   


 

 
 C&C consists of business-to-business companies specializing in commercial and commodities markets, each an expert in its industry, that deliver
their customers access to actionable data and analytics.   


 

 
 MHE is a leading global provider of educational materials, information and solutions serving the elementary and high school, college and university,
professional, international and adult education markets.  On October 3, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement
with The E.W. Scripps Company to sell the Broadcasting Group. The sale was completed on December 30, 2011, when we received net proceeds of approximately $216 million. The divestiture of our Broadcasting Group, previously included in our
C&C segment, was carried out pursuant to our Growth and Value Plan discussed in further detail below. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the Broadcasting Group as a
discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010. 
On September 12, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors unanimously approved a comprehensive Growth and Value Plan that includes separation
into two public companies: McGraw-Hill Financial, focused on content and analytics for financial markets, and McGraw-Hill Education, focused on education services and digital learning. On December 7, 2011, management provided an update on our
Growth and Value Plan discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two independent companies. Highlighted actions included:   


 

 
 Reporting results for 2012 in five lines of business for the new McGraw-Hill Financial (S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices,
Commodities Markets and Commercial Markets).   


 

 
 Reducing the McGraw-Hill Education workforce by 10% to create a flatter and more agile organization, see Note 11  Restructuring to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

 Freezing our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan as of April 1, 2012 and focusing our retirement program on market-competitive offerings, see Note 7
 Employee Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.   


 

 
 Repurchasing additional shares through a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, see Note 9  Equity to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further detail.  We expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a tax-free spin-off
of the education business to the Companys shareholders, subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final Board approval and a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. Professional fees associated with the Growth and
Value Plan recorded during the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $10 million.  Key results for the years ended December 31 are as

 As the customers of our businesses vary, we manage and assess the performance of our business based on the performance of
our segments and use operating income as a key measure. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results generally focuses around our four business segments and their related operating groups versus distinguishing
between products and services.  2011  Revenue increased at our S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices and C&C segments and declined at our MHE segment. Operating income improved at our S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices
and C&C segments and declined at our S&P Ratings and MHE segments.   


 

 
 S&P Ratings revenue increased 4% and operating income declined 6%. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in non-transaction revenues due to
growth in non-issuance related revenue at corporate ratings and increases at CRISIL, our majority owned Indian credit rating agency, partially offset by declines in structured finance. The decline in operating income was driven by an increase in
expenses resulting from staff increases and incremental compliance and regulatory costs as well as a decline in transaction revenue.   


 

 
 S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices revenue and operating income increased 14% and 28%, respectively. Increases were primarily driven by Integrated
Desktop Solutions due to growth at Capital IQ, revenue from TheMarkets.com acquired in September 2010 and our subscription base for the Global Credit Portal, which includes RatingsDirect; S&P Indices due to growth in our exchange-traded fund
products; and increases at Enterprise Solutions driven by growth at Global Data Solutions, which includes RatingsXpress. Also impacting operating income were higher expenses from personnel costs and additional costs to further develop
infrastructure.   


 

 
 C&C revenue and operating income increased 10% and 18%, primarily driven by strong demand for Platts proprietary content and growth in
our syndicated studies and consulting services in the automotive and non-automotive sectors, partially offset by decreases in our construction business. 
 


 

 
 MHE revenue and operating income declined 6% and 12%, respectively, primarily due to decreases in the adoption states as well as open territory sales
at School Education Group. Also impacting operating income were increased costs due to technology requirements and the continuing investment in digital product development.  2010  Revenue increased at our S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices and
MHE segments and declined at our C&C segment. Operating income improved at all four of our segments.   


 

 
 S&P Ratings revenue and operating income increased 10% and 7%, respectively. Increases were largely due to growth in transaction revenues driven by
high-yield corporate bond issuance. These increases were partially offset by declines in structured finance.   


 

 
 S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices revenue and operating income increased 6% and 4%, respectively. Increases were largely due to growth in S&P
Indices, RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect as compared to the prior year. Additional growth occurred at Capital IQ. These increases were partially offset by declines in investment research products. 
 


 

 
 C&C revenue declined 7% and operating income improved significantly compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the divestiture of
BusinessWeek in the fourth quarter of 2009. Offsetting this revenue decline was continued growth in our global commodities information products related to oil and natural gas, increases in both political and base advertising and growth at
JDPA, primarily due to syndicated research sales. 
  17 


Table of Contents


 

 
 MHE revenue and operating income improved 2% and 32%, respectively, primarily due to increases at Higher Education for both print and digital product
and SEG in the adoption states. The increases were partially offset by declines in SEG related to open territory sales and custom testing revenue due to the discontinuation of several contracts. 
Outlook  As discussed above, on
September 12, 2011, we announced our Growth and Value Plan that includes separation into two public companies: McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2012. 
Four key trends are increasing the need for content and analytics in the financial, commercial and commodities markets: 
 


 

 
 The globalization of the capital markets: the global demand for capital and commodities markets trading and liquidity is expanding rapidly in both
developed and emerging markets   


 

 
 The need for data-driven decision making tools: developments in technology, communications and data processing have increased the demand for
time-critical, multi-asset class data and solutions   


 

 
 Systemic regulatory change: new global legislation (e.g. Dodd-Frank, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Basel III) is creating new and
complex operating and capital models for banks and market participants   


 

 
 Increased volatility and risk: there is amplified uncertainty and market volatility around short-term events are driving the need for new methodologies
to measure risk, return and profitability  McGraw-Hill Financial 
In 2012, we plan to focus on the following strategies for our financial information businesses to capitalize on the above four trends: 
 


 

 
 Integrated Solutions: providing integrated solutions within and across market segments that fill evolving customer needs 
 


 

 
 Distribution: capturing additional revenue by leveraging and expanding our strong channel relationships 
 


 

 
 Geographic Penetration: using our vast global footprint to capitalize on opportunities in mature and growth markets 
 


 

 
 Scalable Capabilities: creating and leveraging efficiency and effectiveness through common platforms, processes and standards
  


 

 
 Continuing to pursue targeted acquisitions and alliances 
 


 

 
 Continuing cost-reduction initiatives  McGraw-Hill Education  In 2012, we plan to focus on the following strategies for our
education business:   


 

 
 Continuing to accelerate growth by aligning McGraw-Hill Educations key strengths with market forces 
 


 

 
 Continue to optimize resource allocation for long-term value  Uncertainties  There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any
one or more of these strategies. The following factors could unfavorably impact operating results in 2012:   


 

 
 Prolonged difficulties in the credit markets   


 

 
 A change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses 
 


 

 
 Lower educational funding as a result of state budget concerns 
 


 

 
 A change in educational spending   


 

 
 Unanticipated problems in executing our Growth and Value Plan  Further projections and discussion on our 2012 outlook for our segments can be found within Results of Operations.

 Product revenue and expenses consist of educational and information products, primarily books, magazine circulations and
syndicated study programs in our MHE and C&C segments. Service revenue and expenses consist of our S&P Ratings and S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices segments, service assessment contracts in our MHE segment and information-related
services and advertising in our C&C segment.  Revenue  2011  Product revenue decreased primarily due to decreases at MHE for both adoption and
open territory state sales, decreases at International education from lower sales in Asia, Europe and the Middle East and Africa and decreases in book sales at Professional, partially offset by growth in Higher Education for both print and digital
products. Service revenue increased primarily due to growth in our global commodities products, growth at Capital IQ, revenue from TheMarkets.com acquired in September 2010, non-transaction revenue growth at CRISIL, an increase in our corporate
industrial ratings and higher sales of our exchange-traded fund products. This was partially offset by a decline in our construction business, public finance, structured finance and investment research products. 
2010  Product revenue increased
primarily due to increases at MHE for both print and digital product in Higher Education and for adoption state sales. This was partially offset by lower open territory sales. Service revenue increased primarily due to growth in transaction revenues
driven by high-yield corporate bond issuance, growth in our global commodities information products, index services, credit-ratings related information products such as RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect, and Capital IQ. This was partially offset by
declines in custom testing revenue at MHE due to the discontinuation of contracts and declines at S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices in investment research services and structured finance. The divestiture of BusinessWeek at C&C impacted
both product and service revenue.  Expenses  2011  Product operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in plant amortization, lower
reserve requirements, tight overall cost controls and lower manufacturing and direct expenses given the reduced revenue opportunities at MHE. This was partially offset by increased costs at MHE as a result of technology requirements and the
continuing investment in digital product development. Service operating expenses increased primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and additional costs to further develop infrastructure. Selling and general expenses increased primarily
due to a fourth quarter restructuring plan we initiated across the Company as part of our Growth and Value Plan; higher costs associated with increased sales; higher compensation; and incremental compliance and regulatory costs, primarily in our
S&P Ratings segment.  Net interest expense decreased primarily due to higher international interest income from our investments.

  19 


Table of Contents
2010  Product operating expenses decreased due to reduced prepublication amortization and lower costs related to inventory at MHE, as well as overall cost-saving initiatives. Service operating expenses
increased slightly primarily due to increased compensation expense, partially offset by the divestiture of BusinessWeek at C&C. Selling and general expenses increased as compared to the prior year due to higher costs associated with
increased sales and higher compensation, partially offset by the benefits of cost-saving initiatives and the divestiture of BusinessWeek. 
Net interest expense increased primarily due to the reversal of interest expense on uncertain tax positions that occurred in 2009, as well as lower
international interest income from our investments in 2010 compared to 2009.  Other Items 
2011  Foreign exchange rates had
favorable impacts of $48 million on revenue and $17 million on operating income. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating
current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a
restructuring plan at MHE to create a flatter and more agile organization and across other parts of the Company as part of our Growth and Value Plan, which includes creating two independent public companies with focused cost structures. We recorded
a pre-tax restructuring charge of $66 million, consisting primarily of facility exit costs and employee severance costs related to a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions. 
2010  Foreign exchange rates had a
favorable impact of $13 million on revenue and an unfavorable impact of $3 million on operating income. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are
estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.  During the fourth quarter of 2010,
we recorded a pre-tax charge of $16 million related to subleasing excess space through January 2020 that is managed by our corporate office. 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we initiated a restructuring plan within our C&C segment as a result of current business conditions as well as
continuing process improvements. We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11 million, consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 230 positions. 
During 2010, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $11 million from dispositions in other (income) loss within the Consolidated Statements of Income, which was
comprised of the following:   


 

 
 In September 2010, we sold certain equity interests in India which were part of our S&P Ratings segment, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $7
million.   


 

 
 In August 2010, we sold our Australian secondary education business which was part of our MHE segment, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $4 million.
 The impact of these divestitures on comparability of results is immaterial. 
Provision for Income Taxes  Our
effective tax rate for continuing operations was 36.3% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Including discontinued operations, the effective tax rate was 36.5% for 2011 and 36.4% for 2010 and 2009.  We do not expect our 2012 effective tax rate for continuing operations to vary significantly from our 2011 effective tax rate from continuing operations absent the impact of numerous factors including
intervening audit settlements, changes in federal, state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of our income.

Segment Review  S&P Ratings  Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making
decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet
its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default. 
S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transactional and non-transactional. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:
  


 

 
 ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments; 
 


 

 
 bank loan ratings; and   


 

 
 corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of
a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.  Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees
for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.

   The following items had an impact on results for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:  2011   


 

 
 Foreign exchange rates had favorable impacts of $25 million on revenue and $12 million on operating profit. 
 


 

 
 Pre-tax restructuring charges of $9 million were recorded in the fourth quarter, consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce
reduction of approximately 30 positions.  2010 
 


 

 
 Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $2 million on revenue and a favorable impact of $3 million on operating income.
  


 

 
 Operating income includes a pre-tax gain of $7 million for the sale in September 2010 of certain equity interests in India.
 Revenue  2011  Revenue increased compared to 2010 as non-transaction revenue growth offset the
slight decline in transaction revenue. Non-transaction revenue includes an intersegment royalty charged to S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by S&P Ratings. Royalty revenue for
the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $63 million and $56 million, respectively.  The decrease in transaction revenue was driven
primarily by declines in public finance and structured finance. These declines were partially offset by increases at corporate ratings due to growth in bank loan ratings and high-yield corporate bond ratings revenue. U.S. municipal bond issuance
decreased as municipal market volume continues to decline driven by the expiration of the Build America 
  21 


Table of Contents

Bond program at the end of 2010. However, fourth quarter U.S. municipal bond par issuance was up 9% from the third quarter of 2011, continuing the trend of quarterly issuance volume increases
this year. Declines in structured finance were driven by lower issuance volumes in the U.S. of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and asset-backed securities
(ABS).  Revenue derived from non-transaction related sources increased compared to 2010, primarily as a result of growth in
non-issuance related revenue at corporate ratings, primarily for entity credit ratings, ratings evaluation services and surveillance fees, and CRISIL, our majority owned Indian credit rating agency, primarily for outsourcing services and the
acquisition of Pipal Research in December 2010. This was partially offset by declines in structured finance related to lower annual fees that were adversely impacted by increased deal maturities and defaults, primarily on CDO deals. Annual fees
include surveillance fees and other customer relationship-based fees. Non-transaction revenue represented a larger percentage of total S&P Ratings revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 as transaction revenue decreased and non-transaction revenue
increased in 2011 due to the factors discussed above.  2010  Both transaction and non-transaction revenue grew compared to 2009. The increase in transaction revenue compared to 2009 was driven by significant global high-yield corporate bond issuance, increased U.S.
bank loan ratings and robust U.S. public finance issuance, partially offset by declines in structured finance. The bulk of the high-yield corporate bond issuance related to refinancing activity as borrowers took advantage of low rates replacing
existing bonds with cheaper debt. Structured finance decreased with a greater decline in Europe resulting primarily from decreased central banks repurchase (repo) activity and lower deal breakage fees. Also contributing to the
decrease was lower issuance in the U.S. ABS and RMBS. These declines in U.S. structured finance were partially offset by an increase in revenue from commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). 
Revenue derived from non-transaction related sources increased compared to 2009, primarily as a result of growth in annual surveillance and non-issuance
related revenue at corporate ratings. This was partially offset by declines in structured finance related to lower surveillance fees that were adversely impacted by increased CDO deal maturities and defaults. Deal breakage fees were lower as well.
Non-transaction related revenue represented a smaller percentage of total S&P Ratings revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 as transaction revenue grew at a faster pace.  Operating Income  2011 
Operating income decreased compared to 2010 due to increased expenses resulting from staff increases, incremental compliance and regulatory costs and a
decline in transaction revenue, partially offset by growth in non-transaction revenue as noted above.  2010 
Operating income increased compared to 2009, primarily due to the growth in transaction revenue, partially offset by declines in structured finance as
noted above, and increases in incentive compensation, incremental compliance and regulatory costs and staff increases, mainly in India. 
Issuance Volumes  We monitor
issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within S&P Ratings. Issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer. Issuance volumes can be reported in two ways: by
domicile which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located, or based on marketplace which is where the bonds are sold. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels
as compared to the prior year, based on Thomson Financial, Harrison Scott Publications and S&P Ratings internal estimates.

Covered bonds for the U.S. have low issuance levels in 2011 and 2010.   


 

 
 RMBS volume is down in the U.S. in 2011 due to lower re-REMIC activity (which is the repackaging of existing mortgage-backed securities), high
unemployment, continued home pricing pressures and historically lower levels of mortgage originations. RMBS volume in Europe was up due to stronger issuance in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. 
 


 

 
 CMBS issuance is up in the U.S. in 2011 as volumes continue to bounce back from a low prior-year base and investors have become more comfortable with
the fundamentals of the underlying commercial property markets. However, activity in the fourth quarter was the lowest of the year, reflective of higher volatility, partially driven by the European sovereign crisis. Europe CMBS issuance declined in
2011 as there were a lower amount CMBS deals as the result of widening credit spreads and economic concerns.   


 

 
 Issuance in the CDO asset class has primarily been attributed to nontraditional securitizations of structured credit. Nontraditional assets that are
pooled to create a structured finance instrument could include assets such as railcar and container leases, or timeshare loans. U.S. issuance is down in 2011 due to no leverage fund ratings or national credit union deals issued in 2011 which were a
large driver of 2010 activity. CDO issuance in Europe is down in 2011 due to lack of investor demand for new structures as the result of an uncertain outlook for spreads. 
 


 

 
 ABS issuance in the U.S. is down slightly in 2011 primarily due to economic concerns and market volatility associated with European instability and a
reduction in student loan volumes. These decreases were partially offset by strong auto loan activity and credit card volumes. European ABS growth in 2011 is primarily the result of strength in auto, consumer loans and credit cards.
  


 

 
 Covered bond issuance (which are debt securities backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector loans) in Europe is up in 2011 as legislation
continues to facilitate issuance and investors still view covered bonds as one of the least risky sectors of the structured finance market because the debt and underlying asset pool remain on the issuer's balance sheet ensuring that the pool
consistently backs the covered bond.  Industry Highlights and Outlook 
We believe the longer term outlook for the corporate bond market continues to be healthy. There is a large amount of maturing global corporate debt which
will eventually need to be refunded over the next several years. Also, in Europe, non-financial issuance should continue to be bolstered by a shift in corporate financing from bank loans to bonds resulting from increased bank capital requirements.
However, in the short-term, issuers may exercise some discretion as to the timing of the refunding transactions depending upon market conditions. During the second half of 2011, the volatility of the capital markets increased dramatically as the
result of sovereign debt and economic concerns. As a result, credit spreads for both investment grade and high yield issuance widened substantially reducing issuance activity. We expect corporate bond issuance to be subdued until the market
volatility stabilizes. Once this occurs, we expect a resurgence in market activity as many issuers are still waiting for more favorable market conditions in which to issue corporate bonds.  Structured finance non-transaction revenue declined in 2011 as surveillance fees have been adversely impacted by the reduction in CDO deals outstanding through maturities and defaults. The outlook for the
CDO market is dependent upon banks willingness to initiate new loans and investors risk appetite to invest in new CDO structures. 
The recovery of the RMBS and CMBS markets are ultimately dependent upon the recovery of both residential and commercial real estate markets. The U.S. CMBS
market has fared better than the European CMBS market as the European market has been more unfavorably affected by the slowdown in economic growth. Increasing CMBS volumes will be somewhat dependent on the refinancing of commercial loans. The U.S.
RMBS market will continue to remain under pressure given continued uncertainty over home prices and unemployment. Although the European RMBS issuance-volumes were strong during the first half of 2011, they did weaken during the second half of 2011
and any potential resurgence is dependent upon sovereign and economic concerns subsiding.  We expect a modest increase in overall issuance
volumes relative to 2011 in the U.S. as both auto and credit card issuance should grow. In the European ABS market, we expect a steady volume of growth and further credit card issuance in the United Kingdom. The market continues to adjust to new and
proposed rules and regulations from the FDIC, Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC, which may increase the cost to issuers of creating these types of structured finance instruments going forward. In addition, we anticipate a positive outlook
on covered bond issuance in Europe due to recent regulatory initiatives that are favorable to covered bonds. They have also proven to be resilient during the European sovereign crisis.

Legal and Regulatory Environment  The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad. The businesses conducted by our S&P Ratings segment are in certain cases regulated under
the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.  Standard & Poors Ratings Services is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO). The SEC first
began designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SECs Net Capital Rule.  The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the Act) created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that volunteer to be recognized as NRSROs. Under the Act, the
SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Act address, among other things,
prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Ratingss Form NRSRO are available on
S&P Ratings Web site.  Outside the U.S., regulators and government officials have been implementing formal oversight of credit rating
agencies. S&P Ratings is subject to regulations in several foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally, including the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the European
Securities and Markets Authority to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. S&P Ratings expects regulators in additional countries to introduce new regulations in the future. 
We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We
do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being
considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies
and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to S&P Ratings rating
activities.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in the S&P Ratings business, see Item 1a, Risk
Factors Specific to our Standard & Poors Ratings Segment, in this Form 10-K.  In the normal course of business both in the
U.S. and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are involved, from time to time, in governmental and self-regulatory agency proceedings which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or
penalties. Also, various governmental and self-regulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  See Note 13  Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices  S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices differentiates
its revenue between subscription and non-subscription. Subscription revenue primarily includes:   


 

 
 products in our Integrated Desktop Solutions Group, which include the following content: Capital IQ  a product suite that provides data and
analytics for global financial professionals, Global Credit Portal  a web-based solution that provides real-time credit research, market information and risk analytics, and TheMarkets.com  a real-time research offering featuring content
from the worlds leading brokers and independent research providers;   


 

 
 products in our Enterprise Solutions group, such as Global Data Solutions, which combines high-quality, multi-asset class and market data to help
investors meet the new analytical, risk management, regulatory and front-to-back office operations requirements;   


 

 
 investment research products in our Research & Analytics group; 
 


 

 
 and other data subscriptions.  Non-subscription revenue is generated primarily from products in S&P Indices, specifically through fees based on assets underlying exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as certain
advisory, pricing and analytical services in our Integrated Desktop Solutions group.

   The following items had an impact on results for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:  2011   


 

 
 Foreign exchange rates had favorable impacts of $6 million on revenue and $1 million on operating income. 
2010   


 

 
 Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of $2 million on revenue and an unfavorable impact of $6 million on operating income.
 Revenue  2011  Subscription and non-subscription revenue grew compared to 2010. Subscription revenue
increased compared to 2010, primarily due to growth at Integrated Desktop Solutions. This was driven by platform enhancements resulting in market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts at Capital IQ; the acquisition of
TheMarkets.com in September 2010; and growth in the subscription base, both in new clients and in further expanding the existing customer base for the Global Credit Portal, which includes RatingsDirect. Enterprise Solutions also contributed to the
increase driven primarily by growth in the subscription base for Global Data Solutions, which includes RatingsXpress, from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts. 
Capital IQ continues to have significant client growth as the number of clients as of December 31, 2011 increased 14% from the prior year.
Traditionally, subscription revenue has been primarily domestic, however, due to the continued enhancements of the Capital IQ international database, strong sales for the Global Credit Portal and RatingsXpress, particularly in Europe, double-digit
international growth occurred in 2011.  Non-subscription revenue increased primarily at S&P Indices as total revenue increased 18%. Revenue
from S&P Indices represents 24% of total S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices revenue in 2011. S&P Indices increased due to a mix of higher average levels of assets under management for ETF products linked to our indices, significant
increases in exchange-traded derivatives from higher trading volumes as a result of recent market volatility, increased mutual fund revenue, higher sales from over-the-counter derivatives, and 73 new ETFs launched during 2011. Assets under
management for ETFs rose 5% to $314 billion in 2011 from $300 billion in 2010. Also contributing to the increase in subscription revenue were higher data and custom index sales.  2010  Subscription and non-subscription revenue grew compared to 2009. Subscription revenue
increased compared to 2009 driven by increases at Ratings Direct and RatingsXpress; growth at Capital IQ and S&P Indices; and the acquisition of TheMarkets.com in September 2010. These factors were partially offset by declines in investment
research products. Revenue from RatingsDirect and RatingsXpress increased as a result of strong growth in our subscription base from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts. The number of Capital IQ clients at
December 31, 2010 increased 16% from 2009. Increased data sales to financial institutions at S&P Indices contributed to the increased subscription revenue. Offsetting these increases were decreases in investment research products, primarily
resulting from the expiration of the Independent Equity Research settlement at the end of July 2009.  Non-subscription revenue at S&P
Indices increased mainly due to growth in ETF products from higher levels of assets under management, in addition to 95 new ETFs launched during 2010. Assets under management for ETFs rose 22% to $300 billion in 2010 from $247 billion in 2009 due to
the recovery in global markets. In addition, S&P Indices benefitted from ETFs changing their benchmarks to our indices in 2010.

Table of Contents
Operating Income  2011  Operating income increased compared to 2010, primarily due to growth in ETF products,
increases in the subscription base for the Global Credit Portal and Global Data Solutions and strong results in our CUSIP business in Enterprise Solutions. In addition, growth at Capital IQ and the acquisition of TheMarkets.com contributed to the
increase. These increases were partially offset by higher personnel costs and staff increases internationally, mainly in India, and additional costs to build out our integrated data feed within Global Data Solutions and costs to further develop our
infrastructure.  2010 
Operating income increased slightly compared to 2009, primarily due to increases at S&P Indices and increases from Ratings Direct and RatingsXpress.
This was partially offset by declines in investment research products as noted above, and increases in incentive compensation and staff increases internationally, mainly in India, and dilution from the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. 
Industry Highlights and Outlook 
The segment is focused on integrating and evolving its assets and capabilities into one scaled business that offers unique, high-value offerings across
all asset classes. As a result of this integration, demand is expected to continue to increase for our Capital IQ and data and information offerings in 2012. Also, products at S&P Indices should continue to benefit as ETF assets grow globally.
While market volatility is expected to continue in 2012, an anticipated recovering economy and a slightly less volatile market may slow growth in our traded S&P Indices products. This group also should see opportunities in products
internationally, primarily in the Middle East and Asia. Further, cross-selling opportunities will continue to present themselves as S&P Indices launched a product in 2011 that has capabilities to integrate with our Capital IQ platform.
 In addition, in November 2011 we announced an agreement with CME Group to establish a new joint venture in the rapidly growing index business.
Under this agreement, we will contribute our S&P Indices business and the CME Group/Dow Jones joint venture will contribute the Dow Jones Indices business to create S&P/Dow Jones Indices, a global leader in index services. S&P/Dow Jones
Indices is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2012, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. 
Legal and Regulatory Environment 
The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Capital
IQ / S&P Indices are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. 
The markets for financial research, investment and advisory services are very competitive. S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices competes domestically and
internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. 
On November 17, 2009, the European Commission, Directorate-General for Competition (EC) sent a Statement of Objections (SO)
to the Company outlining the ECs preliminary view that Standard & Poors CUSIP Service Bureau (an S&P Ratings brand that is part of S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices) was abusing its position as the sole-appointed
National Numbering Agency for U.S. securities by requiring financial institutions and Information Service Providers to pay licensing fees for the use of International Securities Identification Numbers. As set forth in the SO, the ECs
preliminary view was that this behavior amounted to unfair pricing and infringed European competition law. The Company believed these preliminary views were erroneous but in order to resolve the investigation, proposed a set of commitments to the
EC. Following market testing of the commitments, further discussions between the parties and some limited modifications to the commitments, the EC on November 15, 2011 accepted and made those commitments legally binding and ended its
investigation. Pursuant to the commitments, CUSIP Global Services will create and distribute a new data feed of US International Securities Identification Numbers tailored specifically to the institutions for their use within the European Economic
Area within five months.  See Note 13  Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

   The following items had an impact on results for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:  2011   


 

 
 Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of $4 million on revenue. 
 


 

 
 Pre-tax restructuring charges of $6 million were recorded in the fourth quarter, consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a
workforce reduction of approximately 100 positions.  2010 
 


 

 
 Pre-tax restructuring charges of $11 million were recorded in the fourth quarter, consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a
workforce reduction of approximately 230 positions.  Revenue 
2011  Revenue increased primarily by
strong demand for Platts proprietary content and by growth in syndicated studies and consulting services across our automotive and non-automotive sectors.  Platts revenue grew by more than 21% and represents nearly 47% of total C&C revenue for the year. Platts global commodities products, primarily related to petroleum and natural gas, have
shown strong growth as continued volatility in commodity prices drove the need for market information. The spread between the highest and lowest price for crude oil futures during the year was approximately 63% greater than the spread in the prior
year. The growth rate in international revenue across the commodities products was strong across all regions, particularly in Asia and Europe. 
International growth for our automotive revenue was strong in 2011 across all regions. Also contributing to our revenue growth for 2011 was the final
transitioning during 2010 of certain automotive syndicated studies to an online service platform. This resulted in revenue that was deferred last year to be recognized this year. The majority of this revenue has now been recognized so this will not
continue to favorably impact revenue comparisons in 2012.  Partially offsetting these increases at C&C were decreases in our construction
business as market declines have continued to slow new business growth.  2010  Revenue declined compared to 2009, primarily driven by the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December 2009. Offsetting this decline was continued revenue growth in our global commodities information
products, primarily related to oil. Continued volatility in crude oil and other commodity prices drove the need for market information, particularly in Europe and Asia.  Operating Income  2011 
The key drivers for operating income growth in the segment for 2011 were the revenue growth mentioned above along with lower compensation costs as a
result of restructuring actions. Additional costs from our acquisition of Bentek Energy LLC and Steel Business Briefing Group partially offset the growth in the segment. Also impacting operating income were a number of nonrecurring items consisting
of a write-off of deferred costs recorded in prior periods, offset by a gain on the sale of our interest in LinkedIn Corporation as discussed in more detail in Note 2  Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Significant Events to our
Consolidated Financial Statements, and insurance recoveries on costs incurred in prior periods.

2010  Key drivers for operating profit growth in the segment compared to 2009 were the positive impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek and growth in our global commodities information products.
 See Note 13  Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters affecting the segment.
 Industry Highlights and Outlook  In 2012, C&C expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable the businesses to become more integrated, creating a foundation for the development of new products and revenue
streams. The segment will further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth.  The continuing growth in oil
demand and the uncertainty of supply causes volatility in energy prices, which will drive market participant demand for Platts proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics to enable trading decisions. The International
Energy Agency projects that world oil consumption will grow by 1.3 million barrels per day to 90.3 million barrels per day in 2012. The most dynamic emerging market growth has come from China, where oil demand is expected to grow 5.3% this
year, which is the fastest rate of any country in the world.  Demand for our automotive studies is driven by the performance of the automotive
industry. In 2011, global and U.S. light vehicle sales increased 4% and 10%, respectively, compared to 2010, largely as a result of continued strength in emerging markets, recovery in Western Europe and U.S. demand. For 2012, JDPA projects growth
for global and U.S. light vehicle sales of approximately 8% and 9% year on year. Growth in 2012 is expected to be driven primarily by the continued recovery in the mature automotive markets and growth in the emerging automotive markets leading to
increased demand for JDPA automotive consulting, retail and quality tracking and other proprietary services. Likewise, improved economic conditions are expected to facilitate growth in JDPAs traditional non-automotive businesses globally.
 Demand for our construction offerings is primarily dependent on the non-residential construction industry. In 2011, the value of new
construction starts declined 2% from a year ago. In 2011, non-residential building construction declined 4% from a year ago, while residential building climbed 2%, compared to 2010, helped by the strengthening multifamily housing sector.
Non-building construction in 2011 was down 3% from a year ago, as decreased activity for public works was partially offset by a sharp gain for electric utilities. In 2012, total construction starts are forecast to rise 2%, reflecting renewed
strengthening for the housing sector and modest growth for commercial building from extremely low levels. Commercial building in 2012 is estimated to rise 10%. At the same time, tight federal and state budget conditions will have a dampening impact
in 2012 on institutional building (down 2%) and public works construction (down 5%).  McGraw-Hill Education 
MHE consists of two operating groups: the School Education Group (SEG), serving the elementary and high school (el-hi) markets,
and the Higher Education, Professional and International Group (HPI), serving the college and university, professional, international and adult education markets.

Revenue  School Education Group  2011 
Revenue at SEG decreased compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the adoption states that was largely driven by Texas. Last year SEG
received significant revenue related to the states reading/literature adoption, but this years adoption for other curriculum areas offered less revenue potential for SEG. Florida sales declined for the year as opportunities in this
years science adoption could not match our results in last years math adoption. Also impacting the revenue decline was our decision to participate in fewer adoption subject categories in several states owing to funding uncertainties.
These decreases were offset by higher sales in California, where the states largest district, Los Angeles Unified, adopted McGraw-Hills California Treasures as its new K-5 reading program. Sales were also higher in Louisiana,
where our science programs were successful.  Sales in the open territory decreased from the prior year due to lower sales in Pennsylvania, New
York, Ohio, Minnesota and Alaska. A significant factor in the decline is the success SEG had last year in capturing federal stimulus funds, which were largely spent by 2011 and thus fewer opportunities were available. Partially offsetting these
declines were higher sales in Maryland for elementary reading products.  Custom testing revenue increased slightly primarily due to increases
in the scope of work for a contract in the Middle East, partially offset by the timing of revenue in Missouri. Formative assessment declined slightly, as did non-custom or shelf revenue. A factor affecting this years testing market
was lower-than-anticipated spending of Race to the Top funds by the award-winning states and assessment consortia. However, all grants made in 2010 must be spent within a four-year period, which should improve opportunities in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
 2010  Revenue was
essentially flat compared to 2009, as higher sales in the state new adoption market were offset by declines in open territory sales and in custom testing revenue that did not repeat due to the discontinuation of contracts in Florida, Arizona and
California. SEGs sales in the adoption states increased from 2009. The largest growth occurred in Texas, which did not adopt new materials in 2009, but conducted a K-12 reading and literature adoption in 2010. Also contributing to the increase
were higher sales in Florida, where purchasing was driven by the K-12 math adoption. Offsetting this growth were reductions in sales in Tennessee, where 2010 adoption offered less potential than the 2009 adoption, and South Carolina, where a
scheduled high-school math adoption was not funded. Residual sales in the adoption states decreased as compared to 2009 because more schools bought new materials this year for implementation in the fall and as a result they reordered fewer
previously adopted materials. In the K-12 market, new basal programs are implemented at the beginning of the fall term, and therefore the majority of the purchasing is done in the second and third quarters. In a number of adoption states, pressures
on educational budgets caused many school districts to limit or postpone purchases of educational materials during the year.  SEGs sales
in the open territory decreased from 2009, due to lower sales in Ohio, New Jersey, Missouri and Michigan as a result of state and district budget constraints. Illinois also contributed to the decrease by suspending its textbook loan program, which
normally provides purchasing assistance to local districts, during 2010.  In addition to the declines in custom testing, non-custom or
shelf testing also decreased compared to 2009 across all product lines. These decreases in testing were partially offset by an increase in formative assessment due to the continued growth of SEGs Acuity program resulting
from new business and renewals of existing business.  Higher Education, Professional and International 
2011  In the HPI group, Higher Education
increased from the prior year due to strong growth in several disciplines, notably business and economics, as well as significant growth in digital revenue driven by the Homework Management product line, primarily McGraw-Hill Connect. Our
agreement with Blackboard contributed to Higher Educations revenue as instructors and students began to activate Connect through the Blackboard platform. Sales generated by McGraw-Hill Create and other custom learning solutions
also increased as more and more instructors chose to build their own curriculums.

 Key titles contributing to performance in 2011 included McConnell, Economics, 19/e; Ober, Gregg College Keyboarding, 11/e; Saladin,
Anatomy and Physiology, 6/e; Sanderson, Computers in the Medical Office, 7/e; and Wild, Fundamental Accounting Principles, 20/e.  Professional increased slightly over the prior year due to continued growth in digital subscription revenue and in e-book sales, which were driven by the proliferation of e-reading devices during 2011.
These gains were partially offset by a decline in print book sales that was driven principally by conditions in the retail market.

Table of Contents
International decreased slightly from the prior year as lower sales in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, where regional conditions affected some markets, were offset by growth in Latin America, India and Canada.  2010 
Higher Education increased for both print and digital products, driven by higher enrollments in the academic year and by strong publication lists and
attractive new digital offerings in all major subject areas.


 
 Digital growth was driven by the continued success of the Homework Management product line, which included new releases on the improved and enhanced
Connect platform. E-book revenue also increased over the prior year.  Professional increased over 2009 due to
increases in net book publishing sales (including both print books and e-books) as returns were significantly lower than the prior year. Growth in other digital revenue, primarily from digital subscription products, also contributed to the increase.
 International increased slightly over 2009, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Higher sales in the Middle East, Africa
and Asia were partially offset by declines in Canada and in other international markets.  Operating Income 
2011  Operating income for MHE declined
compared to 2010, primarily due to declines in revenue at SEG as noted above, as well as increased costs, primarily due to technology requirements and the continuing investment in digital product development. This decrease was partially offset by a
reduction in plant amortization, lower reserve requirements, tight overall cost controls and lower selling and marketing expenses given the reduced revenue opportunities.  2010  Operating income for MHE improved compared to 2009, primarily due to the increases in
Higher Education sales combined with lower costs and expenses, notably reduced prepublication amortization, lower costs related to inventory, cost-saving initiatives and savings from the realignment of several business operations within the segment
that occurred during the second quarter of 2009.  Industry Highlights and Outlook 
According to statistics compiled by AAP, total net sales of elementary and secondary instructional materials decreased by 9.4% through December 2011. Net
sales for the industry in the adoption states decreased by 12.7% compared to 2010, and net sales in the open territory states decreased by 5.7% compared to 2010.  Total U.S. PreK-12 enrollment for 2011-2012 is estimated at nearly 56 million students, up 0.3% from 2010-2011, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). We
project that the 2012 el-hi market could decrease by approximately 9% versus the 2011 market. This decline reflects lower opportunities in the adoption states, where the most significant reduction is anticipated in Texas. Although there will be some
carry-over purchasing from the 2011 adoption, Texas will not be adopting new materials in 2012. Key adoption opportunities will be offered by K-12 social studies in Florida, K-12 reading and literature in Mississippi, K-12 math in Alabama and
continued purchasing of reading and literature in California. As in 2011, the size of the new adoption market in 2012 will depend to a considerable extent on the level of funding provided in each state. In recent years, several adoption states have
begun operating more like open territory states in that fewer local districts within these states are purchasing newly state-listed materials in the early years of adoption. In the open territory itself, however, sales are projected to increase
slightly in 2012 after declining in 2011.  Revenue at HPI is affected by enrollments, higher education funding and the number of courses
available to students. The median projected increase in U.S. college enrollments is a rise of 13% to 20.6 million between 2007 and 2018, according to NCES. The U.S. college new textbook market is $4.5 billion and is expected to grow
about 0%-3% in 2012. As technology continues to be the key trend in higher education for course management and content delivery, HPI will continue its digital transformation by aggressively pursuing a variety of e-initiatives, including e-books,
homework support for students and online faculty support.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have
been strong cash generators. Income and, consequently, cash provided from operations during the year are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our businesses, particularly educational publishing. The first quarter is the smallest, accounting
for 21% of revenue and 14% of income from continuing operations in 2011. The third quarter is the largest, accounting for 31% of revenue and generating 44% of 2011 income from continuing operations. This seasonality also impacts cash flow and
related borrowing patterns as investments for MHE are typically made in the first half of the year to support the strong selling period that occurs in the third quarter. As a result, our cash flow is typically lower in the first half of the year and
higher in the second half. 
  30 


Table of Contents
In 2012, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are
expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including among others: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share
repurchases, dividends, investment in publishing programs, capital expenditures and investment in our digital initiatives and infrastructure. 
Cash Flow Overview  Cash and cash
equivalents were $944 million as of December 31, 2011, a decrease of $582 million as compared to December 31, 2010, and consisted of domestic cash of $296 million and cash held abroad of $648 million. Typically, cash held outside the U.S.
is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the U.S., as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years are expected to be abroad. In the event funds from international
operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds.

 In 2011, we generated free cash flow of $807 million versus $881 million in 2010, a decrease of $74 million. The decline
is due primarily to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. In 2011,
free cash flow was adjusted for the taxes paid on the sale of our Broadcasting Group. Capital expenditures include investments in pre-publication costs, purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information on page 33 for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. 
Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include amounts related to discontinued operations. In 2011, cash flows from investing activities include
proceeds of $216 million from the sale of our Broadcasting Group. Discontinued operations did not have a significant impact on cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in 2010 and 2009. 
Operating activities  Cash
provided by operating activities decreased $114 million to $1.3 billion in 2011, mainly due to increased payments to vendors, higher payments for incentives and higher legal and third-party consulting payments, partially offset by an increase in
other assets and liabilities primarily due to higher pension plan contributions in 2010.  Higher incentive compensation payments in 2011
reflect greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 as compared to achievement against targets in 2009.  Investing activities
 Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions, investment in pre-publication costs and capital
expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily from dispositions.  Cash used for investing activities decreased $351 million to $246 million in
2011, primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our Broadcasting Group in December 2011 and a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2010. In 2011, we acquired Steel Business Briefing Group and Bentek Energy LLC, both included as
part of C&C, and assets of Bookette Software Company were integrated with MHE. In 2010, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Pipal Research Corporation and TheMarkets.com LLC, which were included as part of
S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices; substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Tegrity Ltd, which were included as part of MHE; and a minority interest in Ambow Education Holding Ltd. Refer to Note 2  Acquisitions,
Divestitures and Other Significant Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Financing activities
 Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases and dividends, while cash inflows are primarily
proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
  31 


Table of Contents
Cash used for financing activities increased $1.1 billion to $1.7 billion in 2011. The increase is
primarily attributable to cash used to repurchase shares. During 2011, we utilized cash to repurchase approximately 35 million shares for $1.5 billion, including commissions. The average price per share, excluding commissions, was $40.48
(average price per share excludes the accelerated share repurchase transaction, discussed in more detail below). We repurchased 9 million shares for $256 million, including commissions, during 2010. The average price per share, excluding
commissions, was $29.37. The repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. 
In 2011, 8 million shares have been repurchased to complete the stock repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in 2007 (the
2007 Repurchase Program). As of December 31, 2011, no shares remained available under the 2007 Repurchase Program.  On
June 29, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares (the 2011 Repurchase Program), which was approximately 17% of the total shares of our outstanding
common stock at that time. The 2011 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. As of December 31,
2011, 24 million shares remained available under the 2011 Repurchase Program.  On December 7, 2011 we entered into two separate
accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. The first ASR Agreement was structured as an uncollared ASR Agreement in which we paid $250 million on December 12,
2011 and received an initial delivery of approximately 5 million shares subject to a 20%, or $50 million, holdback. The second ASR Agreement was structured as a capped ASR Agreement in which we paid $250 million and received approximately
5 million shares representing the minimum number of common shares to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specific capped price per share. Further discussion relating to our ASR Agreements can be found in Note 9  Equity to
our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Additional Financing  Currently, we have the ability to borrow $1.2 billion in additional funds through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $1.2 billion three-year credit agreement (our credit
facility) that will terminate on July 30, 2013. We pay a commitment fee of 15 to 35 basis points for our credit facility, depending on our credit rating, whether or not amounts have been borrowed, and currently pay a commitment fee of 20
basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent
or the Federal funds rate. For certain borrowings under our credit facility there is also a spread based on our credit rating added to the applicable rate. As of December 31, 2011, we have not utilized our credit facility for additional funds.
 Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in
our credit facility, is not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant has never been exceeded.  Historically, we have also had the ability to
borrow additional funds through Extendible Commercial Notes and a promissory note with one of our providers of banking services, however, effective April of 2011, we have canceled these notes since there is no current market for them. 
Dividends  On January 18,
2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.255 per share. 
Contractual Obligations  We
typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed
herein. For example, we are contractually committed to acquire paper and other printing services and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. 
We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be
adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2012.

 Amounts represent the carrying
value of our debt and do not include interest we pay on our long-term debt, which is described in Note 6  Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 


2 
 Amounts shown include taxes and
escalation payments, see Note 13  Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations. 
 


3 
 We have contracts to purchase paper
and printing services that have target volume commitments, however there are no contractual terms that require us to purchase a specified amount of goods or services and if significant volume shortfalls were to occur during a contract period, then
revised terms may be renegotiated with the supplier. These obligations are not recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements until contract payment terms take effect. 
 


4 
 Other consists primarily of
commitments for unconditional purchase obligations for contracts for data, voice and optical network transport services and certain enterprise-wide IT software licensing and maintenance. 
As of December 31, 2011, we had $57 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.  We make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status
of our plans. During 2011, we contributed $29 million and $10 million to our domestic and international retirement and post-retirement plans, respectively. Expected employer contributions in 2012 are $44 million and $10 million for our domestic and
international retirement and post-retirement plans, respectively. In 2012, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7  Employee Benefits to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as specific purpose
or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such we are not exposed to any
financial liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL
INFORMATION  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital
expenditures, investment in prepublication costs and dividends. In 2011, free cash flow was adjusted for the taxes paid on the sale of our Broadcasting Group. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to
technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow.  We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow
to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for
management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs. 
  33 


Table of Contents
The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our
cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and sales
returns, valuation of inventories, prepublication costs, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that
cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and
changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.  We believe the following critical accounting policies
require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:  Revenue recognition
 Revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered. We consider amounts to be earned once
evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the
relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component
as each component is earned. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered.
The allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received
for instances when the service components are sold separately. In such cases, we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance
periods. Advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. Subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period. 
Product revenue consists of educational and information products, primarily books, magazine circulations and syndicated study products in our MHE and
C&C segments. Service revenue consists of our S&P Ratings and S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices segments, the service assessment contracts of our MHE segment and information-related services and advertising of our C&C segment.
 For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to
estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012.

Table of Contents
Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In
determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating
profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $13 million. A significant estimate in our MHE segment, and particularly within HPI, is the allowance for sales returns, which is based on the
historical rate of return and current market conditions. Should the estimate of the allowance for sales returns in HPI vary by one percentage point the impact on operating profit would be approximately $12 million. 
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance
for doubtful accounts and sales returns. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012. 
Inventories  Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. A significant estimate in our MHE segment is the reserve for inventory obsolescence. In determining this reserve, we consider managements current assessment of the marketplace, industry trends
and projected product demand as compared to the number of units currently on hand. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the estimate for inventory obsolescence is approximately $3 million. 
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the valuation of
inventories and reserve for inventory obsolescence. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012.  Prepublication costs  Prepublication costs, principally external preparation costs, are
amortized from the year of publication over their estimated useful lives, one to six years, using either an accelerated or straight-line method. The majority of the programs are amortized using an accelerated methodology. We periodically evaluate
the amortization methods, rates, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs, which are sometimes dependent upon program acceptance by state adoption authorities. In evaluating recoverability, we consider our current assessment of the
marketplace, industry trends and the projected success of programs.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, prepublication amortization
expense was $198 million, representing 8% of consolidated operating-related expenses and 10% of our MHE segments total expenses. The impact on consolidated amortization expense for a one percentage point change in the annual prepublication
amortization is approximately $2 million.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, no significant changes have been made to
the amortization rates applied to prepublication costs, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of amortization or the methodology applied. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012.
 Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets) 
We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets
are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or managements estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. There were no material impairments
of long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
Goodwill  As part of our annual
impairment test of our 5 reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units

  35

is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value
of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our
reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Under the accounting rules in effect in 2010 and 2009, we were automatically required to perform a quantitative impairment test for each
of our reporting units.  For 2011, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting
units fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts, with the exception of our SEG reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price.  For our SEG reporting unit in 2011 and for all of
our reporting units in 2010 and 2009, in the first step of our quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using
the income approach, which incorporates the use of discounted free cash flow (DCF) analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF
analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit,
adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors
including control premiums.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares
the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of
the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.  Based on our quantitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2011 at SEG, the fair value of SEG exceeded its carrying value by more than 25%. Goodwill associated with SEG as of
December 31, 2011 is $467 million. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include estimating the amount of and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Given the
current market conditions and continued uncertainty with state budgets there could be changes to our SEG estimates and assumptions that could materially affect the determination of their fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which
could be material to our financial position and results of operations. Increasing our discount rate by 1% would not have resulted in the carrying value exceeding the applicable fair value of SEG. We will continue to monitor the recoverability of
goodwill at all our reporting units in 2012.  Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value.
Our only indefinite-lived intangible asset is JDPAs trade name and the fair value is estimated using the income approach. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment is estimated using the
income approach. The fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates,
royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could
be material to our financial position and results of operations.  We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.  Retirement plans
and postretirement healthcare and other benefits  Our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent
on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, healthcare cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we
consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future
working life of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and
other postretirement benefits.  The following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations
for pension and other postretirement benefits:

 Stock-based compensation  Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based
compensation is classified as both operating expense and selling and general expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Stock-based
compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $96 million, $67 million and $22 million, respectively. 
Included in stock-based compensation expense is restricted stock and unit awards expense of $72 million in 2011, $45 million in 2010 and $2 million in
2009.  We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in
valuing the options granted:

 Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These
assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward
rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the
output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Income taxes
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense
and operating expense, respectively.  Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent
information.  Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 36.3% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Including discontinued operations, the
effective tax rate was 36.5% for 2011 and 36.4% for 2010 and 2009.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and
we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2012. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur
within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to
the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. On the basis of present information, it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 For our foreign subsidiaries, we have determined that the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries are permanently reinvested
within its foreign operations. Accordingly, we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability, which may
be material to our future reported results, financial position and cash flows.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we
made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes. Changes in current
tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, thereby impacting our income tax provision.  Contingencies  We are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial
statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a
liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of
liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter.  RECENTLY ISSUED
OR ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  There were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or
are expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1  Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on applicable accounting pronouncements that were adopted in
2011 or will be effective for 2012.  Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  There have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended December 31, 2011. Our exposure to
market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent
company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, we have entered into an
immaterial amount of foreign exchange forwards to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and
2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2012 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP  New York, New York  February 7, 2012

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.  We have audited The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on its Responsibility for the Companys Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2011 of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and our report dated February 7, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP  New York, New York

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts or as noted) 
1. Accounting Policies 
Nature of operations  The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, we, us or our) is a leading global information services provider
serving the financial services, education, commercial and commodities markets with the information they need to succeed in the Knowledge Economy. The commercial markets include automotive, construction, aerospace and defense, and
marketing/research information services, while the commodities market includes energy.  Our operations consist of four operating segments which
have historically been named: Standard & Poors (S&P), McGraw-Hill Financial, McGraw-Hill Information & Media and McGraw-Hill Education (MHE). As part of our Growth and Value Plan we have changed
the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses going forward. S&P has changed to S&P Ratings, McGraw-Hill Financial has been changed to S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices, McGraw-Hill
Information & Media has changed to Commodities & Commercial (C&C) and MHE has remained the same. Going forward, the new McGraw-Hill Financial will include S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices and
C&C.   


 

 
 S&P Ratings provides independent global credit ratings, credit risk evaluations, and ratings-related information research to investors,
corporations, governments, financial institutions, investment managers and advisors globally.   


 

 
 S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices provides comprehensive value-added financial data, information, indices and research services to investors,
corporations, governments, financial institutions, investment managers and advisors globally.   


 

 
 C&C includes business and professional media, offering information, insight and analysis; and consists of business to business companies (including
such brands as Platts, J.D. Power and Associates (JDPA), McGraw-Hill Construction and Aviation Week).   


 

 
 MHE is one of the premier global educational publishers. This segment consists of two operating groups: the School Education Group (SEG),
serving the elementary and high school (el-hi) markets, and the Higher Education, Professional and International Group (HPI), serving the college, professional, international and adult education markets.
 See Note 12  Segment and Geographic Information, for further discussion on our operating segments, which are
also our reportable segments.  We have reported our Broadcasting Group, previously included in our C&C segment, as a discontinued
operation. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been reclassified as held for sale for the
periods presented. See Note 2  Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Significant Events for further discussion.  On
September 12, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors unanimously approved a comprehensive Growth and Value Plan that includes separation into two public companies: McGraw-Hill Financial, focused on content and analytics for financial
markets, and McGraw-Hill Education, focused on education services and digital learning. On December 7, 2011, management provided an update on our Growth and Value Plan discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two
independent companies. Highlighted actions included:   


 

 
 Reporting results for 2012 in five lines of business for the new McGraw-Hill Financial (S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices,
Commodities Markets and Commercial Markets)   


 

 
 Reducing the MHE workforce by 10%, see Note 11  Restructuring for further detail 
 


 

 
 Freezing our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan as of April 1, 2012, see Note 7  Employee Benefits for further detail
  


 

 
 Repurchasing additional shares through a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, see Note 9  Equity for further detail
 We expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a tax-free spin-off of the education business to the
Companys shareholders, subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final Board approval and a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. Professional fees associated with the Growth and Value Plan recorded during the
fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $10 million. 
Principles of consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Table of Contents
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily
liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value and were $944 million and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These investments are not subject
to significant market risk. 
Short-term investments  Short-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting
of certificates of deposit, are classified as held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. Interest and dividends are recorded into income when earned. 
Accounts receivable  Credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition. Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. 
Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In
determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. A significant estimate in
our MHE segment, and particularly within HPI, is the allowance for sales returns, which is based on the historical rate of return and current market conditions. 
Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and the majority of our inventories relate to finished goods. A significant estimate in our MHE segment is the reserve for
inventory obsolescence. In determining this reserve, we consider managements current assessment of the marketplace, industry trends and projected product demand as compared to the number of units currently on hand. 
Prepublication costs  Prepublication costs, principally external preparation costs, are amortized from the year of publication over their estimated useful lives, one to six years, using either an accelerated or straight-line
method. The majority of the programs are amortized using an accelerated methodology. We periodically evaluate the amortization methods, rates, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs, which are sometimes dependent upon program acceptance by
state adoption authorities. In evaluating recoverability, we consider managements current assessment of the marketplace, industry trends and the projected success of programs. 
Deferred technology costs  We capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the
preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of
an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use
over its estimated useful life, three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation
costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Gross deferred technology costs were $193 million and $164 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
deferred technology costs was $122 million and $105 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other
intangible assets)  We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived
assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or managements estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. There
were no material impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
  47 


Table of Contents
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. We have 5 reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.  Consistent with recently issued
accounting rules, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its
carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the
results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Under the accounting
rules in effect in 2010 and 2009, we were automatically required to perform a quantitative impairment test for each of our reporting units. 
When conducting the first step of our two step impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of a discounted free cash flow (DCF) analyses and are
corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting
unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the
fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the
goodwill. The fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the
goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.  Significant judgments inherent in this
analysis include estimating the amount of and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of
fair value for each reporting unit and for some of the reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.  We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. Our only indefinite-lived intangible asset is
JDPAs trade name and the fair value is estimated using the income approach. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant
judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could
materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations. 
We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. 
Foreign currency translation 
We have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international
operations that are determined to be extensions of the Parent Company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue
and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity. 
Revenue recognition  Revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are
performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each
deliverable is provided. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. If the fair value to the customer
for each service is not objectively determinable, management makes its best estimate of the services stand-alone selling price and records revenue as it is earned over the service period. For arrangements that include multiple services,

  48 


Table of Contents

fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately.
Advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. Subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period.  Product
revenue consists of educational and information products, primarily books, magazine circulations and syndicated study products in our MHE and C&C segments. Service revenue consists of our S&P Ratings and S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices
segments, the service assessment contracts of our MHE segment and information-related services and advertising of our C&C segment. 
Shipping and handling costs  All amounts billed to customers in a sales transaction for shipping and handling are classified as revenue. 
Depreciation  The costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from 15 to 40 years and equipment and
furniture from 2 to 10 years. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases. 
Advertising expense  The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. We incurred $52 million, $50 million and $52 million in advertising costs in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Stock-based compensation  Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based
compensation is classified as both operating expense and selling and general expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Income taxes  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize
liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively. 
Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the
need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. 
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different
tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and
assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2012. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any
necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax
benefits is not practicable. On the basis of present information, our opinion is that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Contingencies  We accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the
financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated
possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred. 
Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards 
Recently issued  In May 2011, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance for fair value measurements intended to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The
amended guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amended guidance changes certain

  49 


Table of Contents

fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. The amended guidance will be effective for us beginning
January 1, 2012. We do not anticipate that these changes will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that modified how comprehensive income is presented in an entitys financial statements. The guidance issued requires an entity to present the total of
comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present
the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. The revised financial statement presentation for comprehensive income will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. 
Recently adopted  In December
2010, the FASB revised its guidance for disclosure requirements of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. The objective of the revised guidance is to address diversity in practice regarding proforma disclosures for revenue
and earnings of an acquired entity and specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the
current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro
forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amendments, which went into effect on January 1, 2011, will be applied to any future material business
combinations.  On January 1, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance, when vendor
specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price for a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to allocate arrangement consideration using the
relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing of when revenue is recognized. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material
impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that simplified how an
entity tests goodwill for impairment. The revised guidance provides an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Under the revised guidance, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether goodwill impairment exists prior to performing analyses comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The guidance is effective beginning
January 1, 2012; however, early adoption is permitted. We adopted the FASBs guidance during our fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011. 
Reclassification  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability purposes. 
2. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Significant Events 
Acquisitions 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed acquisitions totaling $200 million. None of our acquisitions were material either individually or
in the aggregate, including the pro forma impact on earnings. All acquisitions were funded with cash flows from operations. Acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2011 included: 
 


 

 
 In July, we acquired the issued and outstanding shares of Steel Business Briefing Group (the SBB Group), a privately held U.K. company and
leading provider of news, pricing and analytics to the global steel market. The SBB Group provides subscription-based, electronic products to the steel industry and its participants through two principal businesses, Steel Business Briefing and The
Steel Index. The SBB Group is included within Platts, part of our C&C segment. In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation, estimates of the fair values of long-lived and intangible assets have been determined utilizing
currently available information and are subject to finalization.   


 

 
 In March, we acquired the assets of Bookette Software Company (Bookette). Bookette engages in the development of software and algorithms
that are used to score and report educational tests for schools, districts, and states and other various educational systems and entities worldwide. Bookette is included within McGraw-Hill Educations California Testing Boards assessment
business.   


 

 
 In January, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of Bentek Energy LLC (Bentek), which is included as
part of our C&C segment. Bentek offers its customers a comprehensive portfolio of data, information and analytics products in the natural gas and liquids sector. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to acquire Benteks knowledge,
skill and expertise in gathering high-quality detailed data and their ability to identify key relationships within the data critical to industry participants. 
  50 


Table of Contents
Our acquisitions of the SBB Group, Bookette, and Bentek were accounted for using the purchase method. Under
the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. We have not completed the final fair value assignments of SBB Group and continue to analyze certain
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily related to tax matters. Intangible assets recorded for all transactions are amortized using the straight-line method for periods not exceeding 12 years. The goodwill acquired from the acquisitions
of Bookette, and Bentek will be deductible for tax purposes; the goodwill acquired from the acquisition of the SBB Group will not be deductible for tax purposes.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, our acquisition and investment activities totaled $364 million. None of our acquisitions or investments was material either individually or in the aggregate,
including the pro forma impact on earnings. Included in these investment activities was the acquisition of a minority interest in a provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. All acquisitions were funded with cash flows from
operations. Acquisitions and investment activities completed during the year ended December 31, 2010 included:   


 

 
 In December, our majority owned subsidiary, Crisil Ltd., acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Pipal Research Corporation
(Pipal), an Indian-based knowledge process outsourcing company focused on providing information to enable management teams to make more informed strategic, operational, and marketing decisions across a broad range of industries. The
acquisition of Pipal will enable Crisil, which is part of our S&P Ratings segment, to expand its service offerings that can be offered to its traditional customer base. 
 


 

 
 In October, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Tegrity Ltd (Tegrity), a software company that focuses
on developing lecture capture software used in the higher education market. The acquisition of Tegrity will strengthen McGraw-Hill Higher Educations portfolio of digital products that integrate traditional learning approaches with web-based
and electronic applications.   


 

 
 In September, we acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of TheMarkets.com LLC, a company focused on providing real-time
investment information to brokers and institutional investors. This acquisition is consistent with S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices focus on creating strategic value through providing access to investment research, data, and analytics to
customers that facilitates informed investment decisions.   


 

 
 In August, we acquired a minority interest in Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (Ambow), an education company headquartered and publicly traded
in China that provides e-learning technologies and education services. Our investment in Ambow is part of our effort to expand our presence into emerging markets by strategically partnering with local businesses. This investment is accounted for as
an available-for-sale security.   


 

 
 In April, we made a $5 million contingent payment related to an asset acquisition in 2008, which is part of our S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices
segment.  In 2009, we did not make any acquisitions.  Non-cash investing activities  Liabilities assumed in conjunction with the
acquisition of businesses are as follows:

Divestitures 
During year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $13 million within other (income) loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income,
which related to the sale of our interest in LinkedIn Corporation in their initial public offering. This investment was held within our C&C segment.  On October 3, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement with The E.W. Scripps Company to sell the Broadcasting Group. The sale was completed on December 30, 2011, when we received net
proceeds of approximately $216 million. As a result of the sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $123 million, which was included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations.  The results of operations of the Broadcasting Group for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the
business have been removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $11 million from dispositions in other (income) loss within
the Consolidated Statements of Income, which was primarily comprised of the following:   


 

 
 In September, we sold certain equity interests which were a part of our S&P Ratings segment, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $7 million. The gain
was primarily from the sale of an equity interest in an Indian commodity exchange that was made to comply with local regulations discouraging foreign-based entities from owning an interest in local Indian exchanges in excess of 5%.
  


 

 
 In August, we sold our Australian secondary education business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $4 million. The divestiture was part of MHEs
strategic initiative to divest from slow growth or retracting markets.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, we
recorded a pre-tax loss of $3 million from dispositions in other (income) loss within the Consolidated Statements of Income, which was primarily comprised of the following: 
 


 

 
 In December, we sold BusinessWeek which was part of our C&C segment. This business was selected for divestiture as it no longer fit within
our strategic plans. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $11 million.   


 

 
 In May, we sold our Vista Research, Inc. business which was part of our S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices segment. This business was selected for
divestiture as it no longer fit within our strategic plans. This divestiture enabled the segment to focus on its core business of providing independent research, ratings, data indices and portfolio services. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $14
million.  Other Significant Events  On November 4, 2011, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with CME Group Inc. (the CME Group) and CME Group Index Services LLC
(CGIS), a joint venture between the CME Group and Dow Jones & Company, Inc. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, we agreed to contribute our S&P index business into a newly formed joint venture entity (the Joint
Venture), and CGIS agreed to contribute its Dow Jones index business into the Joint Venture. In addition, we agreed to purchase Credit Market Analysis Ltd. from the CME Group who in turn contributed the consideration therefore into the Joint
Venture. Following the respective contributions to the Joint Venture, we will own a 73% interest in the Joint Venture and CGIS/CME Group will together own a 27% interest in the Joint Venture. The transaction is subject to various regulatory
approvals and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2012.  This transaction includes a provision under which the CME Group
can require us to purchase up to 100%, but no less than 20%, of their minority interest in the Joint Venture at its fair market value multiplied by the percentage interest specified by the CME Group at the earlier of December 31, 2017 or upon a
change of control of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 
  52 


Table of Contents
The results of operations for the Joint Venture will be consolidated with our results of operations, as we
will control the Joint Venture. When the transaction is completed, the Dow Jones index business will be recorded at its fair value and our S&P index business we contribute will be recorded at its historical or carry-over basis. CGIS/CME
Groups interest will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. 
3. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for our segments:

Goodwill additions/dispositions in the table above relate to acquisitions/dispositions discussed in Note 2  Acquisitions,
Divestitures and Other Significant Events.  Other Intangible Assets  Other intangible assets include both indefinite-lived assets not subject to amortization and definite-lived assets subject to amortization. Our only indefinite-lived asset is JDPAs tradename within
our C&C segment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value for the tradename is $164 million. The following table summarizes our definite-lived assets:

Definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 40 years. The weighted-average life
of the intangible assets at December 31, 2011 is approximately 11 years. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and the projected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for
the years ended December 31, assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions, is as follows:

4. Fair Value Measurements 
In accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at
fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 
 


 

 
 Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 


 

 
 Level 2  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are
not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 


 

 
 Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.  We have investments in equity securities classified as available-for-sale and an immaterial amount of forward
exchange contracts that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values of our investments in available-for-sale securities were determined using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets and are classified within
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair values of our available-for-sale securities are $13.6 million and $22.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other financial instruments, including cash and equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at
cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of our total borrowings is $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and was estimated based on quoted market prices.

We record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not based upon all the
available evidence that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses. 
We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. Undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to $760 million at December 31, 2011. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is
not practicable.  We made net income tax payments totaling $452 million in 2011, $410 million in 2010, and $416 million in 2009. At
December 31, 2011, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $7 million which will expire between 2017 and 2029, and the utilization of these losses will be subject to limitations.

The net increase of $4 million in 2011 is the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that unfavorably impacted tax expense. The unfavorable
impact to the tax provision was partially offset by the favorable outcome of the completed federal, state, local and foreign tax audits.  The
total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $57 million and $53 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expense, respectively. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $13 million and $14 million, respectively, of accrued interest
and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.  During 2011, we effectively completed the U.S. federal tax audit for 2010 and we also
completed various state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2004. The impact to tax expense in 2011 was not
material.  During 2010, we effectively completed the U.S. federal tax audit for 2009 and we also completed various state and foreign tax
audits. The impact to tax expense in 2010 was not material.  During 2009, we effectively completed the U.S. federal tax audit for 2008 and we
also completed various state and foreign tax audits, resulting in a favorable impact to tax expense of $9 million.  However, even though we
have effectively completed the U.S. federal tax audit for the years 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, those years remain open pending the appeal of a certain unresolved issue, which we do not believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under
audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on
estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2012. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we
would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on
unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. On the basis of present information, it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We do not expect our 2012 effective tax rate on continuing operations to vary significantly from our 2011 effective tax rate absent the impact of numerous
factors including intervening audit settlements, changes in federal, state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of our income. 
Although the timing of income tax audit resolution and negotiations with taxing authorities are highly uncertain, we do not anticipate a significant
change to the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits within the next twelve months.

 Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of December 31, 2011, the unamortized debt discount is $0.1
million. These Notes will mature on November 15, 2012.

 Interest payments are due
semiannually on April 15 and October 15, and as of December 31, 2011, the unamortized debt discount is $0.6 million.   


3 
 Interest payments are due
semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of December 31, 2011, the unamortized debt discount is $1.4 million. 
Annual long-term debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of December 31, 2011: approximately $400 million
due in 2012, no amounts due from 2013-2015, and approximately $798 million due thereafter.  Currently, we have the ability to borrow $1.2
billion in additional funds through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $1.2 billion three-year credit agreement (our credit facility) that will terminate on July 30, 2013. We pay a commitment fee of 15 to 35
basis points for our credit facility, depending on our credit rating, whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option,
calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal funds rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a
spread based on our credit rating added to the applicable rate. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we have not utilized our credit facility for additional funds.  Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than 4 to 1, and this
covenant has never been exceeded.  Historically, we have also had the ability to borrow additional funds through Extendible Commercial Notes
and a promissory note with one of our providers of banking services, however, effective April of 2011, we have canceled these notes since there is no current market for them. 
7. Employee Benefits 
We have a number of defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. Our primary
pension plan is a noncontributory plan under which benefits are based on employee career employment compensation. We also have unfunded non-U.S. and supplemental benefit plans. The supplemental benefit plans provide senior management with
supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor voluntary 401(k) plans under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels
of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees compensation to the employees accounts.  We also provide certain post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits for retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans are contributory while the life insurance
plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.  We recognize the funded status of our retirement and post-retirement
plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized
prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.

 In December 2011, our Board of
Directors approved a plan amendment that will freeze our U.S. Employee Retirement Plan (U.S. ERP) effective on April 1, 2012. Our U.S. ERP is a defined benefit plan. Under the amendment, no new employees will be permitted to enter
the U.S. ERP and no additional benefits for current participants for future services will be accrued. This amendment decreased our pension benefit liabilities by $129 million, and resulted in an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
loss of $82 million. We also recorded an immaterial amount of pension plan curtailment expense in 2011 as a result of the plan amendment. 
The actuarial loss and prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our retirement plans and expected to be
recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ending December 31, 2012 are $32 million and $1 million, respectively.  The prior
service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our post-retirement plans and expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2012 is $1 million. There is no actuarial loss in
accumulated other comprehensive loss for our post-retirement plans expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2012.

 Effective January 1, 2012, we
changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to 5.1% from 5.4% in 2011 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. retirement plan (UK plan) to 5.1% from 5.5% in 2011. 
 


3 
 The expected return on assets
assumption is calculated based on the plans asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1, 2012, we changed our return on assets assumption to 7.75% from 8.0% in 2011.

Cash Flows  In
December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as Medicare Part D, and a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and,
accordingly, we are entitled to a subsidy.  Expected employer contributions in 2012 are $44 million for our retirement plans and $10 million
for our post-retirement plans. In 2012, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. Information about the expected cash flows for our retirement and post-retirement
plans and the impact of the Medicare subsidy is as follows:

For securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities prices
obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own
pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g. discounted cash
flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&P 500 commingled index fund. 
The trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3. The
following tables details further information our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

Pension Trusts Asset Allocations  There are two pension trusts, one in the U.S. and another in the U.K.   


 

 
 The U.S. pension trust had assets of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the target allocations in 2012
include 49% domestic equities, 26% international equity securities, and 25% debt securities and short-term investments.   


 

 
 The U.K. pension trust had assets of $258 million and $243 million at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the target allocations in 2012
include 78% equities, 12% U.K. fixed income, and 10% U.K. real estate.  The pension assets are invested with the goal of
producing a combination of capital growth and income. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns,
preserve capital, and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions, and economic sectors.
The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration, U.S. non-agency mortgage backed securities, and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and
government-agency securities, un-invested cash, receivables, and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.

Table of Contents
U.S. Defined Contribution Plans  Assets of the defined contribution plans in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, McGraw-Hill common
stock, stable value, and money market strategies. They also have a self-directed investment option. The plans purchased 695,632 and sold 796,934 shares of McGraw-Hill common stock in 2011 and purchased 650,225 and sold 645,433 shares of McGraw-Hill
common stock in 2010. The plans held approximately 4 million shares of McGraw-Hill common stock at December 31, 2011 and 2010, with market values of $178 million and $149 million, respectively. The plans received dividends on McGraw-Hill
common stock of $4 million during 2010 and 2009. 
8. Stock-Based Compensation 
We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees and Directors under two employee stock ownership plans (the 1993 and
2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plans) and a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.   


 

 
 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan  This plan provided for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock awards, or other stock-based awards. No further awards may be granted under this plan; although awards granted prior to the adoption of the 2002 Plan, as amended, remain outstanding under this
plan in accordance with their terms.   


 

 
 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2002 Plan)  The 2002 Plan permits the granting of nonqualified stock options, SARs,
performance stock, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.   


 

 
 Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan  Under this plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible
Directors. In general, the plan requires that 50% of eligible Directors annual compensation plus dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation
and have an equivalent number of shares credited to the deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the date a recipient ceases to be
a member of the Board of Directors or within five years thereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan. 
The number of common shares reserved for issuance are as follows:

 During 2009, we
reduced the projected payout percentage of our outstanding restricted performance stock awards. Accordingly, we recorded an adjustment to reflect the current projected payout percentages for the awards. 
Stock Options 
Stock options, which may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a two year service
period in equal annual installments and have a maximum term of 10 years. Therefore, stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a two-year graded vesting method. Under this method, fifty percent of the costs are
ratably recognized over the first twelve months with the remaining costs ratably recognized over a twenty-four month period starting from the date of grant.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following
assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:

Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based
on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S.
Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model
and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Stock option activity is as follows:

The total fair value of our stock options that vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $18 million, $20 million and $25 million,
respectively.  We receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises during the period in which the options are exercised, generally
for the excess of the quoted market value of the stock at the time of the exercise of the options over the exercise price of the options (intrinsic value). For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $20 million, $2
million and less than $1 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised are reported in our cash flows used for financing activities.

Restricted Stock and Unit Awards  Restricted stock and unit awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan. Restricted stock and unit performance awards will vest only if we achieve certain financial goals
over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally three years), with vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the awards. Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required
to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.  The stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and unit awards is
determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For restricted stock and unit performance awards, adjustments are made to expense dependent
upon financial goals achieved.  Restricted stock and unit activity for performance and non-performance awards is as follows:

Stock Repurchases  In 2007 the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 45 million shares (the 2007 Repurchase Program). On June 29, 2011, the Board of
Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares (the 2011 Repurchase Program), which was approximately 17% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.

 In June of 2011, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares under our 2007 Repurchase Program from the holdings of the Harold W. McGraw, Jr.
Trust (the Trust) and the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Family Foundation, Inc., a Connecticut non-stock corporation (the Foundation). The shares were purchased at a discount of 1.375% from the June 23, 2011 New York Stock
Exchange closing price through a private transaction with the trustees of the Trust and the Board of Directors of the Foundation. We repurchased these shares with cash for $97 million. Without this discounted repurchase, the average price paid per
share for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been $40.58. The transaction was approved by the Nomination and Corporate Governance and Financial Policy Committees of our Board of Directors and we received independent financial and legal
advice for this transaction.   


2 
 Average price per share information does not include the accelerated share repurchase transaction as discussed in more detail below.

Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to
offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 8 million shares under the 2007 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2011, there were no remaining shares
available under the 2007 Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 26 million shares under the 2011 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2011, 24 million shares remained available under the
2011 Repurchase Program. The 2011 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. 
Accelerated Share Repurchase Program  On December 7, 2011 we entered into two separate Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements (ASR Agreements) with a financial institution to initiate share repurchases, aggregating $500
million.   


 

 
 The first ASR Agreement was structured as an uncollared ASR Agreement for the repurchase of $250 million of shares at a per share price equal to the
volume weighted average price (VWAP) of our common stock between December 7, 2011 and February 22, 2012.   


 

 
 The second ASR Agreement was structured as a capped ASR Agreement for the repurchase of $250 million of shares at a per share price that was capped
based on 110% of the VWAP of our common stock during the period from December 7, 2011 through December 21, 2011. This capped price set the minimum number of shares that will be repurchased. 
Uncollared ASR Agreement  We paid $250
million on December 12, 2011 and received an initial delivery of approximately 5 million shares from the financial institution subject to a 20%, or $50 million, holdback. At the conclusion of the uncollared ASR Agreement, which will occur
on or before February 22, 2012, we may receive additional shares or be required to pay additional cash or deliver shares (at our option) based on the VWAP of our common stock (subject to a discount agreed upon with the financial institution)
during the term of the uncollared ASR Agreement. If necessary, it is our intention to deliver additional shares rather than pay additional cash. The financial institution will deliver any remaining shares to us shortly after the end of the term.
 Capped ASR Agreement  We
paid $250 million and received approximately 5 million shares representing the minimum number of common shares to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specific capped price per share. The capped ASR Agreement commenced on
December 7, 2011 and will end on or before April 23, 2012. The actual number of shares that will be received by us at the termination date of the capped ASR Agreement will be determined based on the VWAP of our common stock during the term
of the capped ASR, subject to the capped price for the purchased shares.  The ASR Agreements were accounted for as two transactions; a stock
purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating
basic and diluted net earnings per share. The forward stock purchase contract is classified as an equity instrument. Increases in the VWAP of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements would decrease the number of shares the financial
institution would be required to deliver, or increase the amount of cash or number of shares we would be required to deliver to the financial institution. Decreases in the VWAP of our common stock during the term of our ASR Agreements would increase
the number of shares the financial institution would be required to deliver to us. As of December 31, 2011, the holdback under the uncollared ASR Agreement and the excess amount paid on a per share basis for the minimum shares purchased under
the capped ASR Agreement were recorded as reductions to additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have evaluated the ASR Agreements for their potential dilution and as a result, these additional shares were not included in our
weighted average diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be antidilutive.

10. Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the
Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential
common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as
follows:

There were 2 million, 1 million and 2 million restricted performance shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the necessary vesting conditions have not yet been met.  The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of
the related option during the period because the effect would have been antidilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the number of stock options excluded from the computation was 10 million, 23 million and
28 million, respectively. 
11. Restructuring 
In order to contain costs and mitigate the impact of current and expected future economic conditions, as well as continuing process
improvements, we have initiated various restructuring plans over the last several years. The plans that are currently active with a remaining liability are further described below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling
and general expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  66 


Table of Contents
In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or
because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through
the Consolidated Statements of Income when it is determined they are no longer needed.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a
restructuring plan at MHE to create a flatter and more agile organization and across other parts of the Company as part of our Growth and Value Plan, which includes creating two independent public companies with focused cost structures. We recorded
a pre-tax restructuring charge of $66 million, consisting primarily of facility exit costs and employee severance costs related to a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions. The remaining reserve at December 31, 2011 is
$62 million and is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Activity of our restructuring liability for our
2011 restructuring actions by segment as of December 31, 2011 is summarized as follows:

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we initiated a restructuring plan within our C&C segment as a result of business conditions at
that time, as well as continuing process improvements. We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11 million, consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 230 positions. For years ended
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we have reduced the reserve related to the 2010 restructuring by $8 million and $2 million, respectively, primarily relating to cash payments for employee severance costs. The remaining reserve as
of December 31, 2011 is $1 million and is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  As of
December 31, 2011, our 2008 and 2006 restructuring initiatives still have remaining reserves relating to facilities costs of less than $1 million and $4 million, respectively. 
12. Segment and Geographic Information 
As discussed in Note 1  Accounting Policies, we have four reportable segments: S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ /
S&P Indices, C&C and MHE.  The Executive Committee, consisting of our principal corporate executives, is our chief operating
decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Segment operating income does not include general corporate expenses or interest expense, which are centrally managed costs. We use
the same accounting policies for our segments as those described in Note 1  Accounting Policies.  Segment information for the
years ended December 31 is as follows:

 Corporate assets consist
principally of cash and equivalents, assets for pension benefits, deferred income taxes and leasehold improvements related to subleased areas. 
We have operations with foreign revenue and long-lived assets in approximately 65 countries. We do not have operations in any foreign
country that represent more than 7% of our consolidated revenue. Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at agreed upon prices and intercompany revenue and profit are eliminated. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our
consolidated revenue.  The following is a schedule of revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region:

13. Commitments and Contingencies 
Rental Expense and Lease Obligations  We are committed under lease arrangements covering property, computer systems and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their economic lives
or their lease term. Certain lease arrangements contain escalation clauses covering increased costs for various defined real estate taxes and operating services and the associated fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
period.

In December 2003, we sold our 45% equity investment in Rock-McGraw, Inc., which owns our headquarters building in New York City, and
remained an anchor tenant of what continues to be known as The McGraw-Hill Companies building by concurrently leasing back space through 2020. As of December 31, 2011, we leased approximately 17% of the building space. Proceeds from the
disposition were $382 million and the sale resulted in a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $131 million ($58 million after-tax) upon disposition. As a result of the amount of building space we retained through our leaseback, a pre-tax gain
of $212 million ($126 million after-tax) was deferred upon the disposition in 2003. This gain is being amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction in rent expense, reducing the deferred gain to $136 million as of December 31, 2011.
 Cash amounts for future minimum rental commitments, including rent payments on the sale-leaseback, under existing non-cancelable leases with a
remaining term of more than one year, along with minimum sublease rental income to be received under non-cancelable subleases are shown in the following table.

Legal Matters 
In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and
are involved, from time to time, in governmental and self-regulatory agency proceedings which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties. Also, various governmental and self-regulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct
investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and
on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) (collectively, Standard & Poors) on September 29, 2005 and October 7, 2005, respectively, in an action brought in the Tribunal of
Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (Bondi), the Extraordinary Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively, Parmalat). Bondi had brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United States
against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this suit, Parmalat claims that Standard & Poors, which had issued investment grade ratings on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalats collapse in December
2003, breached its duty to issue an independent and professional rating and negligently and knowingly assigned inflated ratings in order to retain Parmalats business. Alleging joint and several liability, Parmalat claims damages of euros
4,073,984,120 (representing the value of bonds issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with interest, plus damages to be ascertained for Standard & Poors alleged complicity in aggravating Parmalats financial
difficulties and/or for having contributed in bringing about Parmalats indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. On June 29, 2011, the Court issued its final decision dismissing in its entirety Parmalats main damages
claim which was based on the value of the bonds issued. The Court ordered Standard & Poors to pay Parmalat the sum of approximately euros 784,000 (approximately $1.1 million), representing the amount of rating fees paid to
Standard & Poors by Parmalat, plus interest from the date of service of the Writ of Summons. The Court also ordered Standard & Poors to reimburse Parmalat for euros 47,390 (less than $0.1 million) in trial costs and for
its share of fees paid to Court-appointed experts, amounting to euros 67,797 (also less than $0.1 million). The deadline for any party to file an appeal is the earlier of one year and 45 days from the date the judgment was issued or 30 days after
any party serves a copy of the judgment on another party.  In a separate proceeding, the prosecutors office in Parma, Italy is conducting
an investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June 2006, the prosecutors office issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation (Note of Completion) concerning allegations, based on Standard & Poors investment
grade ratings of Parmalat, that individual Standard & Poors rating analysts conspired with 
  69 


Table of Contents

Parmalat insiders and rating advisors to fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The Note of Completion was served on eight Standard & Poors rating analysts.
While not a formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the prosecutors intention that the named rating analysts should appear before a judge in Parma for a preliminary hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine whether there is
sufficient evidence against the rating analysts to proceed to trial. No date has been set for the preliminary hearing. On July 7, 2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma prosecutors office on behalf of the rating analysts.
 On October 8, 2009, an action was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled Reed Construction Data, Inc.
v. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. in which Reed Construction Data asserted eleven claims under various state and federal laws against the Company relating to alleged misappropriation and unfair competition by McGraw-Hill Construction and seeking an
unspecified amount of damages, plus attorneys fees and costs. In response to the Companys motion to dismiss five of the eleven claims in the Reed action, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on December 10, 2009, among other things
adding an allegation that McGraw-Hill Construction misappropriated Plaintiffs confidential and trade secret information regarding specific construction projects. The Company filed a renewed motion to dismiss five of the eleven claims in the
Amended Complaint on January 22, 2010. On September 14, 2010, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss three of the five claims, including claims that alleged violations by the Company of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) and conspiracy to violate RICO. On May 31, 2011, the Court granted Plaintiffs motion to file a Second Amended Complaint that, among other things, added a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act, including a
demand for treble damages and attorneys fees. The Second Amended Complaint also contains allegations purporting to further support Reeds existing tort and antitrust claims. On June 3, 2011, the Court granted the Companys
motion to file a counterclaim against Reed alleging, among other things, that Reed misappropriated the Companys trade secrets and engaged in unfair competition as a result of Reeds recruitment of former employees of the Company and use
of information about the Companys customers obtained from the former employees to solicit those customers. The parties are currently engaged in fact discovery.  The Company and Standard & Poors Ratings Services, together with other credit rating agencies, have been named in numerous lawsuits in U.S. State and Federal Courts, as well as in foreign
jurisdictions, relating to the ratings activity of Standard & Poors Ratings Services brought by alleged purchasers and issuers of rated securities. The Company and Standard & Poors Ratings Services have also received
numerous subpoenas and other government inquiries concerning the rating activity of Standard & Poors Ratings Services in these areas and continue to respond to all such requests. Additional actions, investigations or proceedings
may be initiated from time to time in the future.  In addition, the Company and certain of its officers and directors have been named in a
putative class action brought under the federal securities laws by its shareholders and two putative class actions by participants in the Companys ERISA plans relating to alleged misrepresentations and omissions concerning the Companys
ratings business:  On August 28, 2007, a putative shareholder class action titled Reese v. Bahash was filed in the District Court for the
District of Columbia, and was subsequently transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Company and its CEO and former CFO are currently named as defendants in the suit, which alleges claims under the federal securities laws in connection
with alleged misrepresentations and omissions made by the defendants relating to the Companys earnings and S&Ps business practices. On November 3, 2008, the District Court denied Lead Plaintiffs motion to lift the
discovery stay imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act in order to obtain documents S&P submitted to the SEC during the SECs examination. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint which was fully
briefed and submitted as of May 2009. The Court granted a motion by plaintiffs permitting the plaintiffs to amend the complaint on June 29, 2010 and the Third Amended Complaint was filed on July 1, 2010. Defendants motion to dismiss
the Third Amended Complaint has been fully briefed before the Court.  On September 10, 2008, a putative shareholder class action titled
Patrick Gearren, et al. v. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., et al. was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Board of Directors, its Pension Investment Committee and the administrator of its
pension plans. The Complaint alleged that the defendants breached fiduciary duties to participants in the Companys ERISA plans by allowing participants to continue to invest in Company stock as an investment option under the plans during a
period when plaintiffs allege the Companys stock price to have been artificially inflated. The Complaint also asserted that defendants breached fiduciary duties under ERISA by making certain material misrepresentations and non-disclosures
concerning the ratings business in plan communications and the Companys SEC filings. A virtually identical complaint was filed on June 12, 2009 in an action titled Sullivan v. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. et al., Case
No. 09-CV-5450 in the Southern District of New York. On February 10, 2010 both actions were dismissed in their entirety for failure to state a claim under applicable law. Both plaintiffs appealed and on October 19, 2011, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissals in their entirety. Both plaintiffs have petitioned the Court of Appeals for reconsideration en banc.  On September 22, 2011 the Company received a Wells Notice from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) stating that the staff is considering
recommending that the Commission institute a civil injunctive action against Standard & Poors Ratings Services alleging violations of federal securities laws with respect to S&Ps ratings for a particular 2007 offering of
collateralized debt obligations, known as Delphinus CDO 2007-1. The Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation nor a 
  70

finding of wrongdoing. It allows its recipients the opportunity to provide their perspective and to address the issues raised by the staff before any decision is made by the Commission on whether
to authorize the commencement of an enforcement proceeding against its recipients. S&P has responded to the staff presenting its position on the issues raised and why the Commission should not commence enforcement proceedings. 
The Company believes that the claims in the proceedings described above have no basis and they will be vigorously defended by the Company and/or the
subsidiaries involved.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, we cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be,
what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be. We believe, based on our current knowledge, that the outcome of the legal actions,
proceedings and investigations currently pending should not have a material, adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition.

 Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter and full year presented. The number of
weighted-average shares outstanding changes as common shares are issued pursuant to employee stock plans, as shares are repurchased by us, and other activity occurs throughout the year. Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share data
may not agree with the calculated full year earnings per share.  The results of operations of the Broadcasting Group for all periods presented
have been reclassified to reflect the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation. Refer to Note 2  Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Significant Events for further discussion.

Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 incorporated herein by reference from Exhibit (32) to this Form 10-K.  This
Item 9a. includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in the required certifications.  Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of December 31, 2011, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December 31, 2011.  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
management is required to provide the following report on our internal control over financial reporting:   


 
1.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
 


 
2.
Management has evaluated the system of internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework.
Management has selected the COSO framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurement of our internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. 
 


 
3.
Based on managements evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of
December 31, 2011. There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by management.   


 
4.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2011, and has issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 40 and 41 of this Form 10-K. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  Item 9b. Other Information 
Not applicable.
