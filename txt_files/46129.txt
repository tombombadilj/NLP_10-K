    Item 1.    Business.     
        Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (Allied Motion or the Company) was organized under the laws of Colorado in 1962 and operates in
the United States, Europe and Asia. Allied Motion utilizes its underlying core "electro-magnetic, mechanical and electronic motion technology/know how" to provide compact, high performance products as
solutions in a wide range of motion applications. The Company designs, manufactures and sells motors, electronic motion controls, gearing and optical encoders to a broad spectrum of customers
throughout the world. The Company sells components individually and also provides integrated motion control solutions to customers. The Company sells its products through its own direct sales force
and manufacturer's reps and distributors. System solutions are provided out of our North American and European Solution Centers. The products are manufactured at the Company's own facilities and at
contract manufacturing facilities in China and Eastern Europe, where the Company owns all the capital equipment and tooling and has designed and set-up the manufacturing processes in each
facility. 
        Examples
of the end products using Allied Motion's technology in the medical and health care industries include surgical robots, prosthetics, electric powered surgical hand pieces,
programmable
pumps to meter and administer infusions associated with chemotherapy, pain control and antibiotics; nuclear imaging systems, automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, kidney dialysis equipment,
respiratory ventilators and heart pumps, wheel chairs, scooters, stair lifts, patient lifts, patient handling tables and beds. In electronics, our products are used in the handling, inspection, and
testing of components and in the automation and verification of final products such as PC's, game equipment and cell phones. Our motors are used in the HVAC systems of trucks, buses, RV's, boats and
off-road construction/farming equipment. These motors operate a variety of actuation systems (e.g., lifts, slide-outs, covers etc.), they provide improved fuel
efficiency while the vehicles are idling and are used in drive-by-wire applications to electrically replace or power-assist a variety of mechanical linkages. Our products are
also utilized in high performance vehicles, vehicles using alternative fuel systems such as LPG, fuel cell and hybrid vehicles. Our geared motor products are utilized in automated material
handling vehicles/robots, commercial grade floor cleaners, commercial building equipment such as welders, cable pullers and assembly tool. Several products are used in a variety of military/defense
applications including inertial guided missiles, mid range munitions systems, weapons systems on armed personnel carriers, unmanned vehicles and in security and access control in camera systems, door
access control and in airport screening and scanning devices. Other end products utilizing our technology include high definition printers; tunable lasers and spectrum analyzers for the fiber optic
industry; processing equipment for the semiconductor industry, as well as ticket and cash dispensing machines (ATM's). 
        Allied
Motion has Solution Centers in North America and Europe that provide more integrated motion control solutions to our customers. Providing this service using our
Technology/Know-How provides our customers with more complete system solution, as opposed to just providing customers with individual components. Many of the system solutions provided to
customers include components from our various Technology Units (TUs). Allied Motion is organized into seven Technology Units ("TUs"): Emoteq Corporation (Allied Motion TulsaTulsa, OK),
Motor Products Corporation (Allied Motion OwossoOwosso, MI), Stature Electric, Inc. (Allied Motion WatertownWatertown, NY), Allied Motion Controls (Allied Motion
AmherstAmherst, New York and Allied Motion CanadaWaterloo, Ontario, Canada), Precision Motor Technology B.V. (Allied Motion DordrechtDordrecht, The
Netherlands), Östergrens Elmotor AB (Allied Motion StockholmStockholm, Sweden), and Ostergrens Changzhou (Allied MotionChangzhou). Allied Motion also has
contract production capabilities in Slovakia and China. The Company is currently in the process of setting up a Solution Center in Asia.

known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results of the Company to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties include those associated
with the present economic circumstances in the United States and throughout Europe, general business and economic conditions in the Company's motion markets, introduction of new technologies, products
and competitors, the ability to protect the Company's intellectual property, the ability of the Company to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and product acceptance, success of new corporation
strategies and implementation of defined critical issues designed for growth and improvement in profits, the continued success of the Company's customers to allow the Company to realize revenues from
its order backlog and to support the Company's expected delivery schedules, the continued viability of the Company's customers and their ability to adapt to changing technology and product demand, the
loss of significant customers or enforceability of the Company's contracts in connection with a merger, acquisition, disposition, bankruptcy, or otherwise, the ability of the Company to meet the
technical specifications of its customers, the continued availability of parts and components, increased competition and changes in competitor responses to the Company's products and services, changes

forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
        New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk
factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The
Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis; however, the Company makes no assurance that expectations, beliefs or
projections will be achieved.
 Product Distribution  
        The Company maintains a direct sales force. In addition to its own marketing and sales force, the Company has independent sales
representatives, agents and distributors to sell its various product lines in certain markets. 
 Competition

control
market. Competition involves primarily product performance and price, although service and warranty are also important. 
 Availability of Raw Materials  
        All parts and materials used by the Company are in adequate supply. No significant parts or materials are acquired from a single source
or for which an alternate source is not also available. 
 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions  
        The Company holds several patents and trademarks regarding components used by the various subsidiaries and has several patents pending
on new products recently developed, which are considered to be of major significance. 
 Working Capital Items  
        The Company currently maintains inventory levels adequate for its short-term needs based upon present levels of production.
The Company considers the component parts of its different product lines to be readily available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. 
 Sales to Large Customers  
        During years 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. 
 Sales Backlog  
        The Company's backlog at December 31, 2011 consisted of sales orders totaling approximately $44,005,000 while backlog at
December 31, 2010 was $37,856,000. In our commercial motors markets, the Company continues to serve customers requesting shipments on a "pull system" whereby the Company agrees to maintain
available inventory that the customer "pulls" or takes delivery as they need the products. At the time the customer pulls the product, the Company records the sale. There can be no assurance that the
Company's backlog will be converted into revenue. 
 Engineering and Development Activities  
        The Company's expenditures on engineering and development for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $5,983,000 and
$4,044,000, respectively. Of these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers, although the Company does charge some customers non-recurring engineering (NRE)
charges for custom engineering that is required to develop products that meet the customer's specification. 
 Environmental Issues  
        No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company's operations and it is not anticipated that the
Company's operations will be materially affected by Federal, State or local provisions concerning environmental controls. The Company's costs of complying with environmental, health and safety
requirements have not been material. 
        The
Company does not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the
foreseeable future on the Company's business or markets that it serves, nor on the Company's results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. The Company will continue to monitor
emerging developments in this area.

    Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
 Overview of 2011  
        For the year 2011, we achieved record sales, record orders, record profits, record cash-flow and we ended the year with a
record backlog. 
        Sales
to our medical, vehicle, industrial and electronics markets were up in 2011 while aerospace and defense was flat. In 2011, orders were $117 million, up from
$92 million in 2010. Year ended Backlog was $44 million compared to $38 million at the end of 2010. 
        Net
income and earnings per share for 2011 were record highs, as we continued to place a lot of emphasis on providing more value added motion control solutions to our customers and we
continued to market our electronic motion control capabilities. 
        From
a Cash Flow perspective, we improved our cash net of debt position by $6.3 million. We began 2011 with cash net of debt of $2.7 million and ended the year with
$9 million in cash net of debt. We also instituted a quarterly dividend program in the third quarter of 2011, and in 2012 we announced a 25% increase in our dividends per share to $.025 per
share in a recent press release. 
 Our Strategy  
        As this record year was coming to a close, we felt it was important to capitalize on our positive momentum and to update the long term
strategy for Allied Motion. In December 2011, we brought our global team together and focused on a "One CompanyOne Team" approach to update
and create the Strategic Plan for the next three to five years. Reviewing the aggressive Goals and Objectives established by our team, we believe it clearly indicates that our team is ready and
willing to take Allied Motion to higher levels in the future. Our global team updated our long term strategy and established new long term goals and objectives and developed the Critical Issue Plan to
achieve these goals. The execution of this plan will further establish Allied Motion as a leader in its selected target market segments. 
        Our
strong financial condition, combined with Allied Systematic Tools (AST) to continuously improve Quality, Delivery, Cost and focus on the creation of Innovative
"Motion Solutions That Change the Game" and create value for our customers, allow us to have a positive outlook for the continued long term growth of
our Company. 
 Outlook for 2012  
        For 2012, we've built our plans with the expectation that Europe would exhibit minimal growth, North America modest growth and Asia
would have the highest levels of growth. We also feel that China will continue to lead world-wide growth although we expect their costs will continue to rise relatively quickly. Therefore,
these factors lead us to a strategy that builds upon our proven technical expertise and treats the region as an important growth market and not just a low cost labor source in the future.

Table of Contents 
        We expect that internal Cash Flow from our operations will continue to fund our growth opportunities, both internal and external, and our dividend program will
continue. We are confident that our cash flows can support our growth initiatives and also reward our shareholders at the same time. 
        We
will emphasize Gross Margin improvement. Gross Margin improvement requires cost reduction, new products emphasizing more complete Motion Control systems and a support structure
trained to sell, apply and service our products and customers. We made good progress in 2011 and these initiatives will continue in 2012. 
        Electronic
Motion Control brought new growth opportunities and added value in several new applications in 2011 and we expect more of the same in 2012. We made two acquisitions in 2010
that brought more Electronic Motion Control capabilities and we will continue to invest aggressively in this area. 
        Our
One Team Sales Force developed nicely in North America and Europe, and we will begin establishing the same capability in Asia. Our Solution Centers differentiate us from our
competition and will become functional in North America and Europe and the foundation will be established in Asia in 2012. Together with our One Team Sales Force, the Solution Center is the glue that
allows us to function and act as One Company, a common request from our customers. 
        Our
platform based Product Line approach whereby we preplan what products are required by our served market segments, provides us the capability to quickly deliver prototypes, be first
in with application solutions and secure new design-in wins. While it is relatively simple to achieve this on an independent component level basis, a coordinated effort to tie all of our
technologies together as systems is where the real opportunity lies and that will be our emphasis. 
        Further
development and promotion of our parent brand, Allied Motion, will continue in 2012. A Global structure has been defined and we will use that to our advantage in the marketplace. 
        We
also plan to take our commitment to AST to a new level in 2012 as we invest in additional resources as part of our Operational Excellence Team to continuously build and utilize AST to
improve efficiencies and eliminate waste throughout our Company.

believe the strategy we have developed for the Company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation
necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability.

        NET
INCOME:    The Company achieved record net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $6,967,000 or $.81 per diluted share compared to a previous record of
$3,585,000 or $0.45 per diluted share for 2010. The 2011 results include a $1.1 million adjustment to the earnout that was part of the Östergrens acquisition in 2010. Excluding
the earnout adjustment of $1.1 million, the Company achieved a 64% increase in net income, or $0.68 per diluted share. This year's results include the results from Östergrens,
which was acquired in December 2010 and AM Canada which was acquired on June 3, 2010. 
        EBITDA
and ADJUSTED EBITDA:    EBITDA was $11,774,000 and $6,984,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $11,376,000 for 2011 compared to $7,776,000 for 2010.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are non-GAAP measurements. EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is
before stock compensation expense, as well as other nonrecurring items, such as adjustments to the earnout related to the Östergrens acquisition, acquisition transaction costs,
inefficiencies from the relocation of the encoder operations, and net insurance recoveries. See information included in "Non-GAAP Measures" below for a reconciliation of net income to
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. 
        REVENUES:    Revenues
were $110,941,000 in 2011 compared to $80,591,000 in 2010. Of this 38% increase, revenues from existing businesses increased 11% and incremental revenues
achieved by the two companies acquired in 2010 contributed 27% of the increase. The 38% increase in sales from last year was the result of an increase in sales in virtually all of our major industry
sectors except Aerospace and Defense which was flat for the year. 54% of our sales for the year were to US customers with the balance of our sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Sales to our US customers 
11



 
Table of Contents
increased
25% and sales to customers outside of the US were up 57% for the year. Of the 38% increase in revenues, 36% was due to an increase in sales volume for the year and 2% was due to a favorable
currency change. 
        BACKLOG:    The
Company's backlog at December 31, 2011 consisted of sales orders totaling approximately $44,005,000 while backlog at December 31, 2010 was
$37,856,000 reflecting a 16% increase from the end of 2010. 
        Backlog
may fluctuate up or down throughout the year for various reasons, not limited to the following: customer order patterns, annual versus intermittent orders, and long-term
recurring product versus new product orders. 
        GROSS
MARGIN:    Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 30% and 28% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. This 2% improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the
Company's continuous efforts in reducing costs and selling more value added systems solutions and custom engineered products that typically have higher margins. 
        SELLING
EXPENSES:    Selling expenses were $5,626,000 and $3,872,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 45% increase is primarily due to an increase in the Company's sales
force as a result of the acquisition of Östergrens, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
        GENERAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:    General and administrative expenses were $12,639,000 in 2011 and $9,938,000 for 2010. The 27% increase is primarily a result of
additional general and administrative costs as a result of the acquisitions of AM Canada and Östergrens, which were made in the second and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively, as well
as increased compensation expense, which includes incentive bonuses, partially offset by reduced acquisition related expenses. 
        ENGINEERING
AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES:    Engineering and development expenses were $5,983,000 and $4,044,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 48% increase is primarily a
result of the increased engineering staff from the acquisitions of AM Canada and Östergrens, which were made in the second and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. 
        AMORTIZATION
OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS:    Amortization of intangible assets expense was $732,000 and $551,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 33% increase is the result of the
additional intangible amortization from the Östergrens acquisition, partially offset, by certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in 2010. 
        NET
INSURANCE RECOVERIES:    Net insurance recoveries were $685,000 for 2010. The recoveries in 2010 represent the final settlement for the business interruption insurance
claim which resulted from the fire at the Company's COPI facility in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
        INCOME
TAXES:    Provision for income taxes was $2,552,000 and $1,581,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        The
effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 27% and 31% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 is lower than the
statutory rate primarily due to differences in state and foreign tax rates, as well as permanent differences, which were primarily the result of the adjustment to contingent consideration. 
 Non-GAAP Measures  
        EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under generally
accepted accounting principles. 
        The
Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Company's operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Company's management to measure the operating
performance of the Company's business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest

expense
that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Company's industry. 
        The
Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well
as certain non-recurring items. Nonrecurring items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. The Company considers these
items to be of significance in nature and/or size, and accordingly, has excluded these items from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in 2011 excludes the earnout adjustment related to the acquisition of
Östergrens, while Adjusted EBITDA in 2010 excludes transaction costs of $447,000 that were incurred in conjunction with the acquisitions of Östergrens and Agile Systems
(now known as Allied Motion Canada), insurance recoveries of $685,000, and $232,000 of expenses due to inefficiencies from the relocation of the Company's encoder operation. 
        EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure
for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
        The
Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for 2011 and 2010 is as follows (in thousands):

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
        The Company's liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased $5,602,000 during 2011 to a balance of $9,155,000
at December 31, 2011. The increase in cash in 2011 compares to a decrease of $917,000 in 2010. The 2010 decrease is primarily a result of the two acquisitions completed by the Company in 2010,
which were accomplished primarily with cash on hand. 
        During
2011, operations provided $8,881,000 in cash compared to $7,168,000 provided for 2010. The increase in cash provided from operations of $1,713,000 is primarily due to higher net
income. In addition, net working capital has increased as a result of the Company's growth and higher order intake in 2011 compared to 2010. Also, the increase in the accrual for employee incentive
bonus programs were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the increased growth and profitability of the Company. 
        Net
cash used in investing activities was $2,181,000 and $8,317,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Purchases of property and equipment were $1,849,000 and $1,213,000 in 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Cash
paid in 2010 for the acquisitions of Agile Systems Inc., now known as Allied Motion Canada, and Östergrens, net of cash acquired, was $7,104,000. 
        Net
cash used in financing activities of $838,000, as opposed to cash provided in financing activities of $513,000 for 2010. Cash used in 2011 was the result of $667,000 in payments
against existing lines of
credit, dividends paid to shareholders of $333,000, and $162,000 of cash proceeds primarily due to the exercise of stock options. 
        At
December 31, 2011, the Company had $157,000 in debt obligations. 
        The
average outstanding borrowings for 2011 were $465,000. As of December 31, 2011, the amount available to borrow under the Company's various
lines-of-credit was approximately $8.4 million. 
        The
Company's Credit Agreement, as amended, is used for borrowing needs that may occur in the United States and Europe. The Credit Agreement provides revolving credit up to
$4 million and €3 million. Borrowings under the revolver incur interest of LIBOR plus 1.5%. Overnight borrowings incur interest at PRIME plus 0.50%. The unused portion of
the revolver is charged a commitment fee of .375% per annum. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to maximum leverage, minimum fixed charge coverage and minimum tangible
net worth of the Company. The Credit Agreement expires on October 26, 2013. 
        Effective
July 1, 2011, the Company obtained a Credit Line Facility in China providing credit of approximately $700,000 (RMB 4,500,000) to provide financing availability for
working capital needs for the Company's subsidiaries in China. There is approximately $550,000 (RMB 3,500,000) available under the facility at December 31, 2011. 
        The
Company has bank overdraft facilities with foreign banks in Europe. The facilities had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2011. The amount available under the overdraft
facilities was approximately $700,000 (€ 300,000 and 2,100,000 SEK). 
        As
part of the Company's quarterly cash dividend program, the Board of Directors declared a dividend and increased the amount from $0.02 to $0.025 per share payable on March 12,
2012 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2012. 
        The
measurement period for the earnout related to the Östergrens acquisition ended December 31, 2011 and the amount owed to the sellers of Östergrens
has been finalized. The Company will pay the remaining contingent consideration related to the Östergrens acquisition of approximately 9,052,000 SEK ($1,313,000 measured in U.S. dollars
as of December 31, 2011) in the first quarter of 2012 from cash on hand. 
        The
Company's working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Company's credit
facilities. 
 Price Levels and the Impact of Inflation  
        The effect of inflation on the Company's costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies, lower costs of
materials and surcharges passed on to customers. The Company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the
industries in which it operates. As the Company's manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi-skilled labor, which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the Company's
production facilities, the Company does not anticipate substantial inflation-related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 Pronouncements Implemented  
        In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-06, "Improving Disclosures About Fair Value
Measurements." ASU 2010-06 requires the separate disclosure of significant transfers into and out of the Level 1 and Level 2 categories; requires fair value measurement
disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities; and requires disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used in Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. These disclosure
requirements became effective at the beginning of 2010. In addition, effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, ASU 2010-06 also requires Level 3
disclosures of activity on a gross rather than a net basis. The Company's adoption of ASU No. 2010-06 had no material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. 
        In
December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, "When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts." ASU
2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is
required if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, after considering whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU
2010-28 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company's adoption of ASU No. 2010-28 had no impact
on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
        In
September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, "IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which specifies
that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis
for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity
determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company's adoption of ASU No. 2011-08 had no impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
 Pronouncements not yet implemented  
        In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Presentation of Comprehensive
Income," which specifies that an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single
continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This amendment also requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification
adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 to defer the requirement to present on
the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. ASU No. 2011-05 and
2011-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 and 2011-12 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of
operations.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Allied Motion Technologies Inc.
Denver, Colorado 
        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Allied Motion Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' investment and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years then ended. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Audits include
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Allied Motion Technologies Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

    ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC.         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 Business  
        Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (Allied Motion or the Company) is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and
selling motion control solutions, which include integrated system solutions as well as individual motion control products, to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the
commercial motor, industrial motion control, medical, and aerospace and defense markets. 
 Principles of Consolidation  
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents  
        Cash and cash equivalents include instruments which are readily convertible into cash (original maturities of three months or less) and
which are not subject to significant risk of changes in interest rates. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions are translated using an average rate. 
 Accounts Receivable  
        Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable; however, changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a
requirement for additional allowances in the future. 
        Activity
in the allowance for doubtful accounts for 2011 and 2010 was as follows (in thousands):

        Depreciation
expense is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of building improvements is provided using the
straight-line method over the life of the lease term or the life of the assets, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Major additions
and improvements are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of retired or sold property are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in
earnings. 
        Depreciation
expense was approximately $1,439,000 and $1,264,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 Intangible Assets  
        Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method.

 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
        The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows
from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest. If projected cash flows are less than their carrying value, the long-lived
assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value. Considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and, if required, estimate the fair value of the impaired long-lived
asset. 
 Goodwill  
        Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in
a business combination. 
        The
Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08, "IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment" in
2011, which specifies that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under this new guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors at
least annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
        Based
on the qualitative assessment, if the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company will
calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of the goodwill based on a discounted cash flow model using business plans and projections as the basis for
expected future cash flows. The fair value estimate is based upon level three inputs from ASC Topic "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", as unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
market data, which required the Company to develop its own assumptions. 
 Warranty  
        The Company offers warranty coverage for its products for periods ranging from 12 to 18 months after shipment, with the majority
of its products for 12 months. The Company estimates the costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical average cost of the repairs. The assumptions used to estimate
warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals are adjusted. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related
product, and are considered a cost of sale. Accrued warranty costs were $372,000 and $341,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 Foreign Currency Translation  
        The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates.
Changes in reported amounts of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that occur as a result of changes in exchange rates between foreign subsidiaries' functional currencies and the U.S.
dollar are included in foreign currency translation adjustment. Foreign currency translation adjustment is included in other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' investment in the
accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders' investment and comprehensive income. Revenue and expense transactions use an average rate prevailing during the month of the related transaction.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of each Technology Unit ("TU") are included in the
results of operations as incurred. 
 Engineering and Development Costs  
        Engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Revenue Recognition  
        The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped or delivered (shipping terms may be either FOB shipping point or destination)
and title has passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 Basic and Diluted Income per Share from Continuing Operations  
        Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted income per share is determined by dividing the net income by the sum of (1) the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and (2) if not anti-dilutive, the
effect of stock awards determined utilizing the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards was 139,000 and 147,000 for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Stock awards to
purchase 0 and 589,000 shares of common stock, were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share for years 2011 and 2010, respectively, since the results would have been
anti-dilutive. 
 Comprehensive Income  
        Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders. 
 Fair Value Accounting  
        Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
        The
guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value which utilizes observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources,
while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following three-level fair value hierarchy: 











 
 
 


 Level 1:
 
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.


 Level 2:
 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.


 Level 3:
 
 Significant inputs to the valuation model that are unobservable.




        The
Company's financial assets and liabilities, other than the pension plan assets, include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt obligations, accounts payable, and
accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these assets approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these
financial instruments. 
        The
following table presents the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011and
December 31, 2010, respectively, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in '000s):

and equipment acquired are valued at replacement cost. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer lists and unpatented technology. Customer lists are valued on the income
approach valuation technique using certain key assumptions for customer attrition and average contribution margin. Unpatented technology is valued on an income valuation approach using the relief from
royalty income method, which includes assumptions of how much revenue will be derived from unpatented technology. The Company estimates the fair value of the goodwill based on a discounted cash flow
model based upon Level 3 inputs, using business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows, which required the Company to develop its own assumptions. 
 Income Taxes  
        The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic "Income Taxes." Consistent with guidance in "Income Taxes", the
current provision for income taxes
represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax return filings each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The change in
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period. Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are
reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment. A valuation allowance may be provided to the extent management deems it is more likely than not that deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, during the periods
in which temporary differences, net operating losses and tax credits become realizable. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these
temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of valuation allowances. 
        The
guidance in "Income Taxes" requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must have a "more likely than not" probability of being sustained based on technical merits
before it can be recognized in the financial statements, assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant

and applying current conventions. The Company does not have significant unrecognized tax benefits and does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits
within the next twelve months. Income tax related interest and penalties recognized in 2011 and 2010 are immaterial. 
 Pension and Postretirement Welfare Plans  
        The Company reports gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but not recognized as components
of net periodic benefit cost, as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, in accordance with ASC Topic "CompensationRetirement Benefits". Amounts recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to the recognition and amortization provisions of those Statements. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk  
        Trade receivables subject the Company to the potential for credit risk. To reduce this risk, the Company performs evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and creditworthiness at the time of sale, and updates those evaluations when necessary. No single customer makes up more than 10% of trade receivables. 
 Use of Estimates  
        The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

        The
Company's amended Credit Agreement, which matures October 26, 2013, provides revolving credit up to $4 million and €3 million. 
        The
amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to maximum leverage, minimum fixed charge coverage and minimum tangible net worth of the Company. The Company
was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. 
        No
principal payments are required on the revolving credit facility prior to maturity. The interest rates on the agreement are variable rates based on one or more interest rate indices,
primarily LIBOR plus 1.5%. All borrowings are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. 
        At
December 31, 2011, approximately $8,400,000 ($4 million and € 3.0 million) was available under the amended Credit Agreement and
approximately $700,000 (€ 300,000 and 2,100,000 Swedish Krona ("SEK")) was available under bank overdraft facilities in Europe. 
        Effective
July 1, 2011, the Company obtained a Credit Line Facility in China providing credit of approximately $700,000 (Chinese Renminbi ("RMB") 4,500,000). This facility will be
used for working capital needs at the Company's China operations, and will mature in October 2012. At December 31, 2011, there was approximately $550,000 (RMB 3,500,000) available under the
facility.

        The
Company has a domestic net operating loss carryforward of $2,081,000 expiring in 2025 through 2030. 
        During
2010, the Company acquired foreign operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in relation to its acquisition of Agile Systems Inc. in Canada. At the time of the
acquisition, the Company could not conclude, on a more likely than not basis, that it would ultimately realize tax benefits from the losses and credits, and therefore valued the deferred benefit at
zero. During 2011 and 2010, the Company utilized a portion of the foreign tax loss carryforward which reduced the consolidated tax provision for income taxes by $244,000 and $195,000, respectively;
however, the Company has not concluded that it
will ultimately realize the foreign tax carryforward on a more likely than not basis. . The Company will continue to assess its ability to utilize any portion of the tax carryforward balance and
whether it should record a deferred tax asset related to this loss carryforward. Realization of the Company's recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable
income in the appropriate tax jurisdictions in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from utilization of domestic net operating losses and tax
credit carryforwards. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at December 31, 2011. The amount
of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable

2011. 
        The
Company files income tax returns in various U.S. and foreign taxing jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations in
its major tax jurisdictions for periods before 2007. The Company is no longer subject to tax examinations in The Netherlands or Sweden for periods before 2006. 
 6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

 Restricted Stock  
        During 2011 and 2010, 130,466 and 293,235 shares of restricted stock were awarded with a weighted average value of $7.08 and $3.38 per
share, respectively. Of the restricted shares granted in 2011, 40,000 shares have performance based vesting requirements. The value at the date of award is amortized to compensation expense over the
related service period, which is generally three years, or over the performance period. Shares of non-vested restricted stock are forfeited if a recipient leaves the Company before the
vesting date. Shares that are forfeited become available for future awards.

 6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued) 
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan  
        The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that covers all non-union U.S. employees who work over
1,000 hours per year. The terms of the ESOP require the Company to make an annual contribution equal to the greater of i) the Board established percentage of pretax income before the
contribution (5% in 2011 and 2010) or ii) the annual interest payable on any loan outstanding to the Company. Company contributions to the Plan accrued for 2011 and 2010, respectively, were
$437,000 and $270,000. These amounts are included in General and Administrative costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Dividends  
        The Board of Directors began a quarterly dividend program in the third quarter of 2011, declaring a $0.02 per share dividend on all
outstanding common shares. For the year ended December 31, 2011, a total of $0.04 per share on all outstanding shares was paid. Based on the terms of the Company's Credit Agreement, as amended,
dividends paid to shareholders are acceptable, subject to the Company's compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
        For
the first quarter of 2012, the Board increased the dividend to $0.025 per share on all outstanding common shares. 
 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
 Operating Leases  
        At December 31, 2011, the Company maintains leases for certain facilities and equipment. The Company has entered into facility
agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases. The total amount of rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line
method over the term of the lease. The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to "Deferred rent obligation," which is included in "Accrued liabilities and
other" in the accompanying Balance Sheet.

 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  
 Severance Benefit Agreements  
        The Company has entered into annually renewable severance benefit agreements with four key employees which, among other things, provide
inducement to the employees to continue to work for the Company during and after any period of a potential change in control of the Company. The agreements provide the employees with specified
benefits upon the subsequent severance of employment in the event of change in control of the Company and are effective for 24 months thereafter. The amount of severance payments that could be
required to be paid under these contracts, if such events occur, totaled approximately $5,028,000 and $2,955,000, respectively as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. In addition, severance benefits
include, for some employees, a gross-up payment for excise taxes, if any. 
 Litigation  
        The Company is involved in certain actions that have arisen out of the ordinary course of business. Management believes that resolution
of the actions will not have a significant adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 8. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS  

        The Company has deferred compensation arrangements with certain key members of management. These arrangements provide the Board with the ability to make contributions based on the
Company's performance and discretionary contributions based on other factors as determined by the Board. It also allows for the participants to make certain deferrals into the plan. The liability
balance is composed of liabilities from previous contributions as well as the performance contribution for the year ended
December 31, 2011. The amount accrued was $1,736,000 and $642,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        In
addition, the Company would contribute certain amounts to a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan in the event of death, disability, or termination without cause, for certain key
executives. As of December 31, 2011 this amount would be approximately $923,000. 
 9. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT WELFARE PLANS  
 Pension Plan  
        Motor Products has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its hourly union employees hired prior to
April 10, 2002. The benefits are based on years of service, the employee's compensation during the last three years of employment, and accumulated employee contributions.

        The
expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long-term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio. Management uses
historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return. The performance of the financial markets and changes in interest rates
impact the funding obligations under our pension plan. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely
impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2012 has been reduced to 7%. 
        The
Company expects to contribute approximately $439,000 to the pension plan during 2012. 
        All
plan assets are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair values are determined using level one inputs, or quoted prices for identical assets in active markets on the
measurement date, as discussed in Note 1. 
        The
pension plan assets allocation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:

pension assets are managed by an outside investment manager. The Company's investment policy with respect to pension assets is to make investments solely in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of the plans and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits accrued and defraying the reasonable expenses of administration. The Company strives to maintain
investment diversification to assist in minimizing the risk of large losses. The pension assets are subject to the following ranges for asset allocation percentages based on the Plan's Investment

 Postretirement Welfare Plan  
        Motor Products provides postretirement medical insurance and life insurance benefits to current and former employees hired before
January 1, 1994 who retire from Motor Products. Employees who retire after January 1, 2005 must have twenty or more years of continuous service in order to be eligible for retiree
medical benefits. Partial contributions from retirees are required for the medical insurance benefits. The Company's portion of the medical insurance premiums are funded from the general assets of the
Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing such post-retirement benefits during employees' active service periods.

        The
amount of accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as income to the plan in 2012 is $68,000, of which $56,000 relates to the actuarial gain and $12,000 to the
prior service credit. 
        Postretirement
medical liabilities can be extremely sensitive to changes in the assumed rate of future medical increases, and, therefore the healthcare cost trend rate assumption can
have a significant effect on the amounts reported. However, the Company's current contractual obligation requires a per capita fixed Company contribution amount through December 2015.

 10. SEGMENT INFORMATION  

        ASC Topic "Segment Reporting" requires disclosure of operating segments, which as defined, are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
        The
Company operates in one segment for the manufacture and marketing of motion control products for original equipment manufacturers and end user applications. In accordance with the
"Segment Reporting" Topic of the ASC, the Company's chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions
about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report
selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material
assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under "Segment Reporting" due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of
products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by "Segment Reporting" can be found in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and within this note. 
        The
Company's wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, Premotec (Dordrecht, The Netherlands), Östergrens (Solna, Sweden), and Allied Motion Canada (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada),
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company acquired Östergrens on

        During
years 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. 
 11. FIRE LOSS AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES  

        In 2008, the Company's former manufacturing facility in Chatsworth, California, sustained heavy damage from a fire. The damaged facility was being leased by the Company. The Company was
fully insured for the replacement of the assets damaged in the fire and for loss of profits consequent to the business interruption due to the fire. In 2010, the Company received the final settlement
of $685,000
for the business interruption losses caused by the fire. As a result of the settlement, no additional losses or recoveries are expected. 
 12. ACQUISITION OF ÖSTERGRENS  

        On December 30, 2010, Allied Motion Technologies B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allied Motion Technologies Inc., acquired 100% of the shares of
Östergrens Elmotor AB, headquartered in Solna, Sweden. Östergrens has manufacturing facilities in Sweden and China. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the operating results of Östergrens for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
        The
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 does not include any results from Östergrens, based on the timing of the acquisition. 
 Pro-forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Statement of Operations (Unaudited)  
        The following presents the Company's unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2010 after
certain pro forma adjustments, such as additional depreciation and amortization as a result of valuation of amortizable tangible and intangible assets, interest on borrowings made by the Company to
accomplish the acquisition giving effect to the acquisition of Östergrens as if it had occurred at January 1, 2010. The pro forma financial information is for information
purposes only and does not purport to present what the Company's results would actually

        The
acquisition of Östergrens was recorded in accordance with Business Combinations and Fair Value guidance. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect adjustments for
anticipated operating efficiencies that the Company expects to achieve as a result of this acquisition. The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to
present what the Company's results would actually have been had these transactions actually occurred on the dates presented or to project the combined company's results of operations or financial
position for any future period. 
 13. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION  

        In conjunction with the acquisition of Östergrens, the Company recorded contingent cash consideration based on the seller meeting certain performance criteria. The Company
paid $332,000 of the contingent consideration in the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The remaining portion of contingent consideration was based on a multiple of the incremental profit achieved
in 2011 over 2010 for certain customer projects. Based on accounting guidance management estimated this amount at the date of the acquisition. Any adjustment to this estimate is recorded in the 2011
operating results as profit or loss, depending on whether the estimate turns out to be more or less than the actual liability. 
        Due
to customer delays and reduced shipments during 2011 for certain of the customer projects, the actual liability was less than the original estimate recorded as of the closing date of
the acquisition. The adjustment to contingent consideration was $1,101,000 and is recorded as profit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Because the adjustment is an adjustment to the
purchase price, no income tax expense is provided on the adjustment. 
        The
following table displays the changes to the contingent consideration liability that relates to Customer Projects:

    Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures.     
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
        The Company's controls and procedures include those designed to ensure that material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, the Company's chief executive officer and
chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely
manner as required by Exchange Act reports such as this Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that they are
effective as of December 31, 2011. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
        Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
        Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
        Management
has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. 
        There
has not been any change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
