General
 
This
Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements which are statements that are not historical or current facts. When used in this
filing and in future filings by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in Atlantic Coast
Financial Corporation’s press releases or other public or shareholder communications, or in oral statements made with the
approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases, “anticipate,” “would be,” “will
allow,” “intends to,” “will likely result,” “are expected to,” will continue,”
“is anticipated,” “estimated,” “projected,” or similar expressions are intended to identify,
“forward looking statements.” Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to
changes in economic conditions in Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s market area, changes in policies by regulatory agencies,
fluctuations in interest rates, demand for loans in Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s market area, the availability
of liquidity from deposits or borrowings to execute on loan and investment opportunities, changes in the position of banking regulators
on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, and competition, all or some of which could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.
 
Atlantic
Coast Financial Corporation wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made, and advise readers that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, substantial
changes in levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks of lending and investing activities, and competitive and regulatory
factors, could affect Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s financial performance and could cause Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.
 
Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect
occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
 
Atlantic Coast
Financial Corporation. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation. On
February 3, 2011, the Company completed a conversion from the mutual holding company structure and a related public offering.  As
a result of the conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC (the “MHC”) and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the former
holding companies of Atlantic Coast Bank (the “Bank”), were merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation.  Atlantic
Coast Bank is 100% owned by the Company and the Company is 100% owned by public stockholders.  The Company sold a total
of 1,710,857 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in the subscription and community offerings, including 68,434 shares
to Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”).  All shares were
sold at a price of $10.00 per share, raising $17.1 million in gross proceeds.  Conversion related expenses of $2.7 million
were offset against the gross proceeds, resulting in $14.4 million of net proceeds, which included $684,000 loaned by the Company
to a trust for the ESOP.  Concurrent with the completion of the offering, shares of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation
common stock owned by public stockholders were exchanged for 0.1960 of a share of the Company’s common stock.

In its prospectus,
dated November 12, 2010, distributed to investors in connection with the Company's second step conversion and stock offering that
was completed in February 2011, the Company disclosed its intent to raise additional capital through a rights offering at such
time as permitted by regulators in order to meet an individual minimum capital requirement for the Bank, which was subsequently
set at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.0%. As previously disclosed, the Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.22% as of September 30,
2011 and 5.83% as of December 31, 2011, and, therefore, the Bank did not meet this requirement at the end of the third or fourth
quarters of 2011. In light of current economic and market conditions, as well as recent operating results, the Company's Board
of Directors has begun a review of its strategic alternatives and has authorized Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel
Nicolaus Weisel”) to explore such alternatives, including a potential business combination in addition to the previously
disclosed rights offering.
 
The regulatory approval
letter issued in connection with the Company's second step conversion prohibited the Company for a period of three years from taking
certain actions, such as discussions relating to a potential business combination that would require stockholder approval, without
the prior written consent of regulators. As part of its review of strategic alternatives, the Company has requested and received
approval from its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve Board (the "Federal Reserve"), to pursue strategic alternatives
that may lead to a transaction that requires stockholder approval. With the Federal Reserve's consent, the Company may now take
the necessary actions to explore its strategic alternatives.
 
Federal regulations
require prior regulatory approval before a converted savings institution or its holding company may take any action that would
result in any person or entity holding more than a 10% ownership interest in a converted savings institution or its holding company
for three years following completion of a mutual to stock conversion.
 
There can be no assurances
that the Company will pursue or complete a business combination or a capital-raising transaction. The Board of Directors will review
all possible strategic alternatives and weigh the relative benefits of such alternatives to stockholders. The Company does not
intend to disclose developments with respect to the progress of its strategic alternatives review process until such time as the
Board of Directors approves or completes a transaction or otherwise determines that further disclosure is appropriate.
 
In the future Atlantic
Coast Financial Corporation may pursue other business activities, including investment alternatives and diversification of operations.
There are, however, no current agreements in place for these activities. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation does not maintain
offices separate from those of Atlantic Coast Bank or utilize persons other than certain of Atlantic Coast Bank’s officers.
Any officer that serves as a director of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is not separately compensated for his service as
a director.
 
Atlantic
Coast Bank. Atlantic Coast Bank was established in 1939 as a credit union to serve the employees of the Atlantic Coast
Line Railroad. On November 1, 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit
Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank (and subsequently a stock savings bank) known as Atlantic Coast Bank. The conversion
has allowed Atlantic Coast Bank to diversify its customer base by marketing products
and services to individuals and businesses in its market area. Unlike a credit union, Atlantic Coast
Bank may make loans to customers who do not have a deposit relationship with Atlantic Coast Bank.
Following the conversion, management of Atlantic Coast Bank continued its emphasis
on residential mortgage lending and commercial real estate lending. See “―Lending
Activities.”

The Bank’s principal
business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in permanent loans
secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one-to-four family residences, home equity loans, and, to a lesser extent, automobile
and other consumer loans. We also have originated multi-family residential loans and commercial construction and residential construction
loans, but will no longer emphasize the origination of such loans. Instead, our new strategy is to increase our small business
lending through our Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lending programs, warehouse lending and to originate commercial
business and owner occupied commercial real estate loans to small businesses. Loans are obtained principally through retail staff,
brokers and wholesale purchases. The Bank intends to sell loans purchased through warehouse lending and originated through small
business lending, rather than hold the loans in portfolio. We also invest in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S.
government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.
 
Revenues are derived
principally from interest on loans and other interest earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue
is generated from service charges and other income.
 
The
Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include savings accounts,
money market accounts, demand deposit accounts and time deposit accounts with varied terms ranging from 90 days to five years.
Deposits are primarily solicited in the Bank’s market area of southeastern Georgia and the Jacksonville metropolitan area
when necessary to fund loan demand. 
 
The
Bank’s address is 12724 Gran Bay Parkway, Jacksonville, Florida, 32258 and its telephone number is (800) 342-2824. Its internet
website is www.atlanticcoastank.net. The Bank’s website is not a part of this
Annual Report.
 
Market
Area
 
The Bank conducts business
from our headquarters and 11 full service branch offices in northeastern Florida and southeastern Georgia. The Bank has branches
located in Jacksonville Beach, Orange Park, Neptune Beach, Westside, Southside and Julington Creek in the Jacksonville metropolitan
area as well as in Waycross, Douglas and Garden City (Savannah area), Georgia. The Bank’s primary lending area is in the
Jacksonville metropolitan area with our deposit customers residing in both the Jacksonville metropolitan and southeastern Georgia
markets.
 
Florida Market
Area. The city of Jacksonville ranks as the 11th largest city in the United States in terms of population with
more than 820,000 residents. When including the three beach cities of Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach and Jacksonville Beach and
Clay, Baker, Nassau and St. Johns counties, the Jacksonville metropolitan area has more than 1.3 million residents. Over the past
10 years, the Jacksonville metropolitan area population has grown at a rate of 10% and is estimated to continue that trend and
exceed state and national population growth trends according to estimates from SNL Financial, a financial services data firm. The
Jacksonville area has one of the lowest costs of living in the United States and residents have a median age of 36.3 years according
to 2008 data from the American Community Survey. The economy in the Jacksonville metropolitan market area is diverse with aviation
and aerospace, supply chain logistics, finance and insurance, information technology, life sciences and manufacturing firms being
the most prominent. Jacksonville has four modern seaport facilities including the Jacksonville Port which is the third largest
in Florida and is being deepened to accommodate substantial planned growth. In addition, Jacksonville is regularly a host city
for major sporting events such as The Players Championship (TPC), the Super Bowl in 2005, and a NCAA basketball tournament site
in 2006 and 2010. Major employers in the Jacksonville metropolitan area include two United States Naval Air Stations, the Duval
County Public School System and the City of Jacksonville.

Over the past 10 years
and in view of the current economic downturn, Jacksonville’s economy has not become as dependent on real estate and real
estate business activities compared to other communities in Florida. However, the downturn in the real estate industry has significantly
affected the Northeastern Florida economy as unemployment was 9.2% as of December 31, 2011, which was slightly lower than the state
average of 10.0% but higher than the national average of 8.5%. In addition, as of December 2011, median sales prices of homes in
the Jacksonville market area have declined 2.7% from December 2010, and 35.1% from December 2007, which is generally recognized
as the beginning of the recession. The decline in home and real estate values has impacted the level of new housing starts, which
remain at historically low levels, and has also resulted in increased levels of foreclosure activity.
 
Despite the economic
downturn, median household income levels in our Jacksonville market area have been generally in line to above state and national
averages since 2000 and are estimated to grow at rates above the state and national averages according to SNL Financial. Based
on the latest FDIC deposit share data, our approximate deposit market share in our Florida market area was less than 1.0%.
 
Georgia Market
Area. The market area of southeastern Georgia is marked by limited growth trends and has a largely agricultural-based economy.
While our Georgia market area has experienced population and household income declines since 2000, it has remained a stable banking
market. Median household income trends are estimated to be above state and generally in line with national averages according to
SNL Financial. Waycross is located in Ware County, Georgia and the dominant employer is the Satilla Regional Medical Center which
employs 1,200 people. Other major employers include Flash Foods, Baptist Village, Ware County State Prison and Wal-Mart. Based
on the latest FDIC deposit share data, our approximate deposit market share in our Georgia market area of Douglas was 2.9%, Waycross
was 24.0% and Savannah was less than 1.0%.
 
Competition
 
The
Bank faces strong competition in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans. Historically, most of
our direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks and thrift institutions
within our primary market areas. In recent years, competition also has come from institutions that largely deliver their services
over the internet. Electronic banking such as this has the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs. Particularly during
times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, we have faced significant competition for investors’ funds from
short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. During periods of increasing volatility in interest
rates, competition for interest-bearing deposits increases as customers, particularly time-deposit customers, tend to move their
accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market. The Bank
competes for these deposits by offering superior service, competitive rates and an arrangement that gives our customers’
access to over 900 ATMs at no charge and the opportunity to earn nationwide ATM refunds. As of December 31, 2011, management believes
that the Bank held approximately 1.0% of the deposits in its primary market areas of southeast Georgia and northeast Florida.
 

4
 

 
Competition within
our geographic markets also affects our ability to obtain loans through origination or purchase as well as originating them at
rates that provide an attractive yield. Competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers, commercial banks, other
thrift institutions, nationally based homebuilders and credit unions. Internet based lenders also have become a greater competitive
factor in recent years. Such competition for the origination and purchase of loans may limit future growth and earnings prospects.

 
Atlantic
Coast Bank completed an update of its website in late 2008 and now enables customers to open accounts online. This new feature,
coupled with the implementation of online advertising, should increase the Bank’s competitiveness in the electronic banking
arena.
 
Lending
Activities
 
General. 
Historically, the Bank has originated for portfolio one-to-four family residential first and second mortgage loans, home-equity
loans and commercial real estate loans, and to a lesser extent commercial and residential construction loans, multi-family real
estate loans, commercial business loans, automobile and other consumer loans. We have not originated any land loans since 2008.
We have not and currently do not originate or purchase sub-prime loans, Alt-A, or offer teaser rate (low, temporary introductory
rate) loans. Our new strategy is to increase our warehouse lending, small business lending, primarily through the SBA, and to emphasize
originating commercial business and owner occupied commercial real estate loans to small businesses.
 
The Company also originates
commercial loans through the 7(a) Program and the 504 Program of the SBA. The 7(a) loans are guaranteed up to 75% of the loan amount
up to a maximum guaranty cap of $3,750,000. The Company typically sells the guaranteed portion of the 7(a) loan into the secondary
market at a premium. The Company earns a 1% servicing fee on the 75% of the loan amount sold. These loans are non-recourse, other
than an allegation of fraud on the part of the lender. At December 31, 2011, SBA 7(a) loans totaled $5.6 million, or 1.1%, of the
gross loan portfolio.
 
In the 504 program
the Company and the SBA are in different lien positions. The typical structure of a 504 loan is that the Bank is in a first lien
position at a 50% loan-to-value (“LTV”), and the SBA is in a second lien position at a 40% LTV. The remaining 10% is
an equity investment from the borrower. At December 31, 2011, SBA 504 loans totaled $4.6 million, or 0.9%, of the gross loan portfolio.
The Company had not sold any 504 loans as of December 31, 2011.
 
The Bank also purchases
both fixed rate and adjustable rate one-to-four family mortgage loans from third parties, to be held-for-sale to investors on the
secondary market within its warehouse lending program. The Bank earns interest until the loan is sold and typically earns fee income
as well. Held-for-sale loans purchased from third parties generally have commitments to purchase from investors. Loans held-for-sale
are sold with limited recourse, and loans are sold servicing released to the investor. Held-for-sale loans were sold on average
within 20 days during 2011.
 

5
 

 
Consistent with the
last two years, and continuing into the near term, the Bank plans to limit the origination of loans retained in its portfolio.
Originated mortgage loans, residential loans purchased through the warehouse lending program and SBA loans are sold to investors
through the secondary market. The Bank generally retains the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans.
 
At December 31, 2011,
the net loan portfolio totaled $505.7 million, which constituted 64.1% of total assets. The Bank underwrites all loans on a fully
indexed, fully amortizing basis. Loans carry either a fixed or adjustable rate of interest. Mortgage loans generally have a longer-term
amortization, with maturities generally up to 30 years, with principal and interest due each month. Consumer loans are generally
shorter in term and amortize monthly or have interest payable monthly. Warehouse loans are underwritten and funded on an individual
loan basis. A percentage of loans are randomly selected for advanced quality control or a third-party fraud-risk analysis report
in addition to the standard underwriting process. SBA loans are underwritten in accordance with SBA guidelines. Commercial real
estate, commercial business, multi-family and nonresidential construction loans have generally larger loan balances and involve
a greater degree of credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. For a description of the primary risks associated
with our non-residential loan portfolio, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors―The Loan Portfolio Possesses Increased Risk
Due To Our Growing Number of Commercial Real Estate, Commercial Business, Construction and Multi-family loans and Consumer Loans
Which Could Increase Our Level of Provision for Loan Losses.”
 
At December 31, 2011,
the maximum amount we could have loaned to any one borrower and related entities under applicable regulations was approximately
$8.5 million. At December 31, 2011, there were no loans or group of loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in
excess of this amount. The Bank’s largest lending relationship was $7.1 million which was comprised of two loans secured
by owner occupied commercial real estate and a line of credit secured by business assets and personal residences of the guarantors.
This loan relationship was performing as of December 31, 2011. The second largest relationship was comprised of loans totaling
$7.0 million secured by owner occupied commercial real estate and business assets. The borrower filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
December 2010, but was paying the adequate protection payments under the plan of bankruptcy and the loans were considered to be
non-performing as of December 31, 2011. The third largest relationship was a $6.1 million loan and is secured by land for development
of residential real estate and a marina. This loan was performing as of December 31, 2011. The fourth largest relationship was
$3.8 million in loans comprised of occupied commercial real estate, equipment financings and residential real estate owned by the
guarantors. These loans were performing as of December 31, 2011. The fifth largest lending relationship was $3.7 million in loans,
which is comprised of two loans, one secured by income producing commercial real estate and one secured by undeveloped land. These
loans were non-performing as of December 31, 2011. These two loans had been restructured and previously classified as performing,
but began to demonstrate some weaknesses, prompting management to classify them as non-performing.

(1)Land and multi-family loans.
 
One-to-Four Family
Real Estate Portfolio Lending. At December 31, 2011, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled $241.5 million,
or 46.9%, of the gross loan portfolio. Generally, one-to-four family loans are underwritten based on the applicant’s employment,
income, credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. The Bank will generally lend up to 80% of the lesser of
the appraised value or purchase price for one-to-four family residential loans. Should a loan be granted with a loan-to-value ratio
in excess of 80%, private mortgage insurance would be required to reduce overall exposure to below 80%. Historically, such collateral
requirements protected the Bank from loss in the event of foreclosure. However given the rapid deterioration in the market value
of residential real estate over the last three years there is now a greater risk of loss if actions such as foreclosure or short
sale become necessary to collect the loan and private mortgage insurance was not purchased.
 
The Bank has de-emphasized
the retention in portfolio of one-to-four family residential home loans over the last two years, in part due to the increased risk.
The Bank added $39.7 million and $63.1 million of one-to-four family residential home loans to its portfolio during 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
 
Properties securing
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally appraised by independent fee appraisers approved by the board of directors.
Borrowers are required to obtain title and hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary, in an amount not less than the
value of the property improvements. Historically, the Bank originated one-to- four family mortgage loans on both a fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate basis, however, more recently the majority of originated loans were fixed rate due to the low interest rate environment.
Management’s pricing strategy for one-to-four family mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive
with other local financial institutions and consistent with the Bank’s internal needs. Adjustable-rate loans are tied to
a variety of indices including rates based on U.S. Treasury securities. The majority of adjustable-rate loans carry an initial
fixed rate of interest for either three or five years which then converts to an interest rate that is adjusted based upon the applicable
index and in accordance with the note. As of December 31, 2011, the total amount of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans
allowing for interest only payments totaled $83.4 million, or 16.2% of the total loan portfolio, and 34.6% of the total one-to-four
family mortgage loan portfolio. We do not currently originate or purchase interest-only one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans and discontinued such activity in December 2007.
 

9
 

 
The Bank’s home
mortgages are structured with a five to 35 year maturity, with amortizations up to 35 years. Substantially all of the one-to-four
family mortgage loans originated are secured by properties located in southeastern Georgia and the metropolitan Jacksonville area.
During 2008 and continuing into 2011, the Bank implemented stricter underwriting guidelines that limited the origination of one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans secured by investment property due to the continued decline in both real estate values and credit
quality in our market area.
 
All of the residential
real estate loans contain a “due on sale” clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and
payable upon the sale of the security property, subject to certain laws. Loans originated or purchased are generally underwritten
and documented pursuant to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae guidelines.
 
Prior to 2008, we originated
investor loans for one-to-four family properties on a limited basis, but since that time the majority of our lending activity has
focused on owner-occupied property. We have not in the past, nor currently, originate sub-prime loans, option-arms or low or no
documentation loans (Alt-A) or similar loans.
 
Commercial Real
Estate Lending. The Bank offers commercial real estate loans for both permanent financing and construction. In the future,
we will focus primarily on permanent financing to owner occupied businesses. These loans are typically secured by small retail
establishments, rental properties, storage facilities, and office buildings located in the Bank’s primary market area. At
December 31, 2011, permanent commercial real estate loans totaled $72.7 million, or 14.1%, of the gross loan portfolio.
 
The Bank originates
both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. The interest rate on adjustable-rate loans is tied to a variety
of indices, including rates based on the prime rate and U.S. Treasury securities. The majority of the Bank’s adjustable-rate
loans carry an initial fixed-rate of interest, for either three or five years, and then convert to an interest rate that is adjusted
annually based upon the index. Loan-to-value ratios on commercial real estate loans generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised
value of the property securing the loan. These loans require monthly payments, amortize up to 25 years, and generally have maturities
of up to 10 years and may carry pre-payment penalties.
 
Loans secured by commercial
real estate are underwritten based on the cash flow of the borrower or income producing potential of the property and the financial
strength of the borrower and guarantors. Loan guarantees are generally obtained from financially capable parties based on a review
of personal financial statements. The Bank requires commercial real estate borrowers with balances in excess of $250,000 to submit
financial statements, including rent rolls if applicable, annually. The net operating income, which is the income derived from
the operation of the property less all operating expenses, must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding
debt. The Bank generally requires an income-to-debt service ratio of 1.2x. Rent or lease assignments are required in order for
us to be assured the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real
estate loans are performed by independent state-licensed fee appraisers approved by the board of directors. The majority of the
properties securing commercial real estate loans are located in the Bank’s market area.
 

10
 

 
Loans secured by commercial
real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or
management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.
If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the
loan may be impaired. See “Non-Performing and Problem Assets.”
 
Other Real Estate
Loans. As of December 31, 2011, other real estate secured loans totaled $29.1 million or 5.7% of the gross loan portfolio
and consisted mainly of land loans, but also included loans secured by multi-family property. In an effort to prevent potential
exposure to additional credit risk due to the continued decline in both real estate values and credit quality in our market area,
the Bank no longer originates new land loans. Loans to commercial and individual borrowers secured by land totaled $23.2 million,
or 4.5% of the gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Generally, these loans carry a higher rate of interest than do residential
permanent loans. The Bank generally underwrote land loans based on the borrower’s ability to repay, credit history and the
appraised value of the subject property.
 
The Bank also offers
loans secured by multi-family residential real estate. These loans are secured by real estate located in the Bank’s primary
market area. At December 31, 2011, multi-family residential loans totaled $5.9 million, or 1.2% of the gross loan portfolio. Multi-family
residential loans are generally originated with adjustable interest rates based on the prime rate or U.S. Treasury securities.
Loan-to-value ratios on multi-family residential loans do not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan.
These loans require monthly payments and amortize over a period of up to 30 years. Loans secured by multi-family residential real
estate are underwritten based on the income producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower. The
net operating income must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt. Rent or lease assignments are required
in order for us to be assured the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing
multi-family residential loans are performed by independent state licensed fee appraisers approved by the board of directors.
 
Loans secured by land
and multi-family real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation
or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the
economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to
repay the loan may be impaired. See “Non-Performing and Problem Assets.”
 
Real Estate Construction
Lending. As of December 31, 2011, real estate construction loans totaled $6.1 million, or 1.2% of the gross loan portfolio.
The real estate construction portfolio consists of both residential and commercial construction loans. Residential construction
loans are generally made for the construction of pre-sold builder homes to individual borrowers. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank
had $2.0 million in residential construction loans. Residential construction loans are underwritten according to the terms available
for permanent financing on the secondary market. Generally, construction loans are limited to a loan to value ratio not to exceed
85% based on the lesser of construction costs or the appraised value of the property upon completion. The Bank also offers construction-to-permanent
loans.
 

11
 

 
Construction only loans
to builders generally have a term of 12 months with a variable interest rate tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.5% and a floor of 6%, with a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 85% of
the cost of the construction or appraised value of the property, whichever is less. As of December 31, 2011, we had loans to four
builders for the construction of pre-sold or speculative one-to-four family residential property and lot inventory that totaled
$2.6 million, which were all performing at December 31, 2011. We have not originated construction only loans since 2007, and do
not intend to originate such loans in the future.
 
Construction-to-permanent
loans are structured where one closing occurs for both the construction and the permanent financing. During the construction phase,
which can last up to 18 months depending on the nature of the residence being built, a member of the loan servicing staff, the
original appraiser, or a fee inspector makes inspections of the site and loan proceeds are disbursed directly to contractors or
borrowers in accordance with the loan funding schedule as construction progresses. Borrowers are required to pay interest only
during the construction phase with the loan converting to the terms of the amortizing note once the construction is completed.
Typically, these loans convert to adjustable rate loans which are held in portfolio.
 
Home-Equity Lending.
The Bank generally originates fixed-term fully amortizing home equity loans. At December 31, 2011, the portfolio totaled $74.2
million, or 14.4%, of the gross loan portfolio. Historically the Bank originated open-ended interest only home equity lines of
credit. Due to continued decline of both real estate values in our market area and the increased
risk inherent with second lien real estate financing, the Bank ceased originating home equity lines of credit in January 2009.
The Bank generally underwrites one-to-four family home equity loans based on the applicant’s employment and credit
history and the appraised value of the subject property. Presently, the Bank will lend up to 80% of the appraised value less any
prior liens. In limited circumstances, the Bank may lend up to 90% of the appraised value less any prior liens. This ratio may
be reduced in accordance with internal guidelines given the risk and credit profile of the borrower. Properties securing one-to-four
family mortgage loans are generally appraised by independent fee appraisers approved by the board of directors or the value is
determined using a qualified asset valuation model. The Bank requires a title search and hazard insurance, and flood insurance,
if necessary, in an amount not less than the value of the property improvements. Currently home equity loans are retained in our
loan portfolio.
 
The
Bank’s home equity lines of credit carry an adjustable interest rate based upon the prime rate of interest and generally
have an interest rate floor. As of December 31, 2011, interest only lines of credit totaled $35.0 million, or 47.2% of the total
home equity loan portfolio, and 11.1% of total residential mortgage loans. All home equity lines have a maximum draw period of
10 years with a repayment period of up to 20 years following such draw period depending on the outstanding balance.
 
Consumer
Loans. The Bank currently offers a variety of consumer loans, primarily manufactured home loans and automobile loans. At
December 31, 2011, consumer loans totaled $67.9 million, or 13.2% of the gross loan portfolio.
 

12
 

 
The
most significant component of the Bank’s consumer loan portfolio consists of manufactured home loans. The loans are originated
primarily through an on-site financing broker after being underwritten by Atlantic Coast Bank. Loans secured by manufactured homes
totaled $49.5 million, or 9.6% of the gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Manufactured home loans have a fixed rate of
interest and may carry terms up to 25 years. Down payments are required, and the amounts are based on several factors, including
the borrower’s credit history. Manufactured home loans 60 days or greater delinquent were $1.2 million, or 2.4% of the manufactured
home loan portfolio at December 31, 2011.
 
The
second most significant component of our consumer loan portfolio consists of automobile loans. The loans are originated primarily
through our branch network and are underwritten by Atlantic Coast Bank. Loans secured by automobiles totaled $11.8 million, or
2.3% of the gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Automobile loans have a fixed rate of interest and may carry terms up
to six years. Down payments are required, and the amounts are based on several factors, including the borrower’s credit history.
Automobile loans 60 days or greater delinquent were $204,000, or 1.7% of the automobile loan portfolio at December 31, 2011.
 
Consumer
loans, except for those secured by manufactured homes, have shorter terms to maturity and are principally fixed rate, thereby reducing
exposure to changes in interest rates, and carry higher rates of interest than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Consumer
loans have an inherently greater risk of loss because they are predominantly secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles
or manufactured homes. In these cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment
of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial
stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 
Commercial Business
Lending. The Bank also offers commercial business loans which may be secured by assets other than real estate. At December
31, 2011, commercial business loans totaled $23.2 million, or 4.5% of the gross loan portfolio. The purpose of these loans is to
provide working capital, inventory financing, or equipment financing. Generally, working capital and inventory loans carry a floating
rate of interest based on the prime rate plus a margin and mature annually. Loans to finance equipment generally carry a fixed
rate of interest and terms of up to seven years. The collateral securing these types of loans is other business assets such as
inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment. Once a loan is in the portfolio, the credit department monitors based on size, risk
rating and payment status. Relationships with aggregate exposure of $500,000 or greater and lines of credit (regardless of amount)
are required to submit financial statements annually. The Bank reviews the performance of these companies and affirms or changes
their risk rating accordingly. Loans with risk ratings of monitor or special mention are reviewed and documented quarterly and
loans rated substandard are reviewed monthly. Loans that become past due 30 days or more are monitored daily and risk ratings adjusted
accordingly. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans of like duration because
they have a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s
business and the sufficiency of any collateral. The Company also originates commercial loans through the 7(a) Program and the 504
Program of the SBA. The 7(a) loans are guaranteed up to 75% of the loan amount up to a maximum guaranty cap of $3,750,000. The
Company typically sells the guaranteed portion of the 7(a) loan into the secondary market at a premium. The Company earns a 1%
servicing fee on the 75% loan amount sold. These loans are non-recourse, other than an allegation of fraud on the part of the lender.
The Bank intends to continue to emphasize loans to small businesses as part of our commercial business lending program in the future.

Loan
Originations, Purchases, and Sales 
 
The
Bank originates portfolio loans through its branch network, the internet and its call center. Referrals from current customers,
advertisements, real estate brokers, mortgage loan brokers and builders are also important sources of loan originations. While
the Bank originates both adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, origination volume is dependent upon customer loan demand
within the Bank’s market area. Demand is affected by local competition, the real estate market and the interest rate environment.

 
Prior to 2008 the Bank
occasionally purchased pools of residential loans originated by other banks when organic growth was not sufficient. These loan
purchases were made following the Bank’s underwriting standards, such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower credit scores.
Similarly, the Bank also participated in commercial real estate loans originated by other banks. These participation loans were
subject to the Bank’s usual underwriting standards as described above applicable to this type of loan. The Bank has not participated
in a commercial real estate loan originated by another bank since May 2007.

both fixed rate and adjustable rate one-to-four family mortgage loans from third parties, to be held-for-sale to investors in the
secondary market, primarily within its warehouse lending program. The Bank earns interest until the loan is sold and typically
earns a fee as well. At December 31, 2011 held-for-sale loans were $61.6 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.08%.
Held-for-sale loans purchased from third parties generally have commitments to purchase from investors. Loans held-for-sale are
sold with limited recourse, and loans are sold servicing released to the investor.
 
Beginning
in 2008 and continuing into 2011, the Bank began to regularly sell originated, conforming residential loans, both fixed
rate and adjustable rate, including the related servicing, to other financial institutions in the secondary market for favorable
fees. The Bank expects to continue this strategy to increase fee income in future periods.
 
From
time-to-time the Bank may sell residential loans from our portfolio to enhance liquidity or to appropriately manage interest rate
risk. The Bank has also utilized the services of a national loan sale advisor to sell non-performing residential mortgage loans,
however, the Bank did not sell any such loans during 2011. 
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 
Individual loan authority
ranges from $100,000 to $500,000 with lending authority based on the individual lender’s lending and loan underwriting experience.
Loans which exceed an individual lender’s authority may be approved using combined authority with another officer on loan
amounts up to and including $1.0 million. Loans exceeding $1.0 million and up to and including $5.0 million must be approved by
our loan committee. Loans exceeding $5.0 million must be approved by the board of directors.

Non-Performing
and Problem Assets
 
When
a borrower fails to make a timely payment on a loan, contact is made initially in the form of a reminder letter sent at either
10 or 15 days depending on the terms of the loan agreement. If a response is not received within a reasonable period of time, contact
by telephone is made in an attempt to determine the reason for the delinquency and to request payment of the delinquent amount
in full or to establish an acceptable repayment plan to bring the loan current. 
 
Modifications are considered
at the request of the borrower or upon the Bank’s determination that a modification of terms may be beneficial to the Bank.
Generally, the borrower and any guarantors must provide current financial information and communicate to the Bank the underlying
cause of their financial hardship and expectations for the near future. The Bank must then verify the hardship and structure a
modification that addresses the situation accordingly.
 
If the borrower is
unable to make or keep payment arrangements, additional collection action is taken in the form of repossession of collateral for
secured, non-real estate loans and small claims or legal action for unsecured loans. If the loan is secured by real estate, a letter
of intent to foreclose is sent to the borrower when an agreement for an acceptable repayment plan cannot be established or agreed
upon. The letter of intent to foreclose allows the borrower up to 30 days to bring the account current. Once the loan becomes delinquent
and an acceptable repayment plan has not been established, foreclosure action is initiated on the loan.
 
Due
to elevated delinquency of one-to-four family residential loans that has existed since 2009, and the increasing complexity of workout
for these types of loans, the Bank engaged the services of a national third party servicer to work out certain loans. One-to-four
family residential mortgage loans, and any associated home equity loan that becomes 60 days past due, are assigned to the third
party servicer for collection. The Bank also assigns other one-to-four family residential loans to the third party servicer irrespective
of delinquency status if the loan is considered to have collection risk. At December 31, 2011 the outstanding balance of loans
assigned to the third party servicer was $74.3 million, of which $7.6 million were non-performing. 
 
Real estate loans serviced
by a third party are subject to the servicing institution’s collection policies. Contractually, the servicing institutions
are required to adhere to collection policies no less stringent than the Bank’s policies. The Bank tracks each purchased
loan individually to ensure full payments are received as scheduled. Each month, servicing institutions are required to provide
delinquent loan status reports to the Bank’s loan operations department. The status reports are included in the month-end
delinquent real estate report to management.

Delinquent Loans.
Total loans past due 60 days or more totaled $41.7 million, or 7.15% of total loans at December 31, 2011. Real estate loans 60
days or more past due totaled $30.9 million, or 5.30% of total loans at December 31, 2011. Construction loans 60 days or more past
due totaled $2.4 million, or 0.41% of total loans at December 31, 2011. Other loans (consisting of home equity, consumer, and commercial
non-real estate) 60 days or more past due totaled $8.4 million, or 1.44% of total loans at December 31, 2011. The following table
sets forth the Bank’s loans delinquent 60-to-89 days and 90 days or more past due by type, number and amount at December
31, 2011 and 2010.

Non-Performing
Assets. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans, accruing loans past due 90 days and more, and foreclosed
assets. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non-performing status whether or not
the loan is 90 days and over past due. Generally, all loans past due 90 days and over are classified as non-performing. For loans
on non-performing, interest income is not recognized until actually collected. At the time the loan is placed on non-performing
status, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current income.
 
The level of non-performing
assets correlates closely with the down-turn in the economy, particularly those parts of the economy associated with real estate.
The Bank had no loans 90 days or greater delinquent that were still accruing interest at any of the dates in the following table.
For additional discussion regarding non-performing assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, see “Part II Item 7 Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2011
and 2010, Non-Performing Assets.”

At December 31, 2011,
the Bank had $46.6 million in non-performing loans, or 8.94% of total loans. Our largest concentration of non-performing loans
at December 31, 2011 was $16.1 million in non-performing one-to-four family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2011,
six of the non-performing one-to-four family residential real estate loans were jumbo loans (loan amount exceeds $417,000) totaling
$3.1 million.
 
Due to the decline
in real estate values over the last three years, the Company believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance
of non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity loans by the expected loss amount at the time the loan becomes
non-performing, typically at 90 days past due, rather than providing a general allowance. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2011
our non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity loan balances were net of $9.7 million of partial charge-offs.
 
Commercial real estate
non-performing loans of $14.2 million as of December 31, 2011 were principally comprised of three loan relationships totaling $10.1
million with specific reserves of $2.5 million. The real estate collateral for these loans is either owner occupied with operating
businesses or income producing properties.
 
Other non-performing
real estate loans, consisting of land and multi-family real estate loans, totaled $5.2 million at December 31, 2011. Land loans
made to two commercial borrowers for the development of residential subdivisions or to purchase single family residential lots
for builder inventory comprised $2.8 million of that total. We have established a specific allocation of $585,000 for these loans
which were in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2011.
 
Non-performing commercial
real estate construction loans at December 31, 2011 consisted of two loans: 1) a $1.7 million loan participation secured by a condominium/hotel
project located near Disney World in Orlando for which we are not the lead lender, is in the process of foreclosure, and the Bank
recorded a $3.3 million charge-off during 2010 and, 2) a $680,000 loan for the construction of office condominiums in our Jacksonville
market. The loan was in the process of foreclosure, but the borrower continues to market and sell units with two units sold in
the fourth quarter of 2011.

Troubled debt
restructurings. Loans for which the terms have been modified as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties are considered
troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). Loans modified as TDRs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired
loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for 12 months in accordance with the modified terms. The assessment
of market rate of interest for homogenous TDR loans is done based on the weighted average rates of those loans compared to prevailing
interest rates at the time of restructure.
 
TDRs which do not perform
in accordance with modified terms are reported as non-performing loans. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 such loans totaled $14.9
million and $828,000, respectively.
 
TDRs classified as
impaired as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

The majority of loans
modified as TDRs are one-to-four family residential loans. Since 2008 the Company has been proactive in attempting to modify residential
and home equity loans in early stage delinquency because we believe modifying the loan prior to it becoming non-performing results
in the least cost to the Bank. The Bank also modifies larger commercial and commercial real estate loans as TDRs rather than pursuing
other means of collection when it believes the borrower is committed to the successful repayment of the loan and the business operations
are likely to support the modified loan terms. There were no further commitments to customers whose loans were troubled debt restructurings
at December 31, 2011.

Loans which were previously
modified as TDRs, are performing in accordance with the modified terms for 12 months or longer and were reported as performing

Real Estate Owned.
Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned. At the time of foreclosure or repossession,
the property is recorded at estimated fair value less selling costs, with any write-down charged against the allowance for loan
losses. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank had real estate owned of $5.8 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from December 31, 2010.
 
Classified Assets.
Banking regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as other real estate owned, debt and equity
securities considered by the Bank and regulators to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful”
or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth
and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized
by the “distinct possibility” the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are
not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,”
with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of
currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss”
are those considered not collectable and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific
loss reserve is not warranted.
 
When an insured institution
classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed
prudent by management and approved by the board of directors. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established
to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated
to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either
to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.
Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the
OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), which may order the establishment of additional general
or specific loss allowances.
 

20
 

 
In connection with
the filing of the Bank’s regulatory reports with the OCC and in accordance with its classification of assets policy, management
regularly reviews the problem assets in the portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with
applicable regulations. The total amount of classified assets (consisting primarily of loans and real estate owned) represented
121.3% of the Bank‘s equity capital and 7.1% of the Bank’s total assets at December 31, 2011.
 
The aggregate amount
of classified assets at the dates indicated was as follows:

Loans considered doubtful
were $789,000 at December 31, 2011, an increase of $124,000 from $665,000 at year end 2010. Assets considered substandard were
$55.2 million, up from $37.6 million at year end 2010. The Bank also designates certain loans as special mention
when it is determined a loan relationship should be monitored more closely. Loans are considered as special mention for a variety
of reasons including changes in recent borrower financial condition, changes in borrower operations, changes in value of available
collateral, concerns regarding changes in economic conditions in a borrower’s industry, and other matters. A loan considered
as special mention in many instances may be performing in accordance with the loan terms. Special mention loans were $9.0 million
and $17.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
As of December 31,
2011 $46.6 million of classified loans were on non-performing status, as compared to $28.2 million at year end 2010.
 
Allowance
for Loan Losses. An allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses
in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and
is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Generally, loan losses are
charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries,
if any, are credited to the allowance. Due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weak United States economy
in general, it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity
loans will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss. As a consequence the Company recognizes the charge-off of impairment
reserves on non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity loans in the period the loan is classified as such. This
process accelerates the recognition of charge-offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process.
 
The
reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management, within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory
guidelines, based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting the Bank’s key lending
areas. Senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the
Bank’s senior management and the board of directors.
 

21
 

 
Management’s
methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include a general loss component
by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans. The allowance also incorporates the results of measuring
impaired loans.
 
The
general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation
of the loans or pools of loans. Changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non-performing loans affect the
amount of this component. Loss factors are based on the Bank’s recent loss experience, current market conditions that may
impact real estate values within the Bank’s primary lending areas, and on other significant factors that, in management’s
judgment, may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Other significant factors that exist
as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends
(including trends in non-performing loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, geographic foreclosure
rates, new and existing home inventories, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments
and recent charge-off experience in particular segments of the portfolio. The impact of the general loss component on the allowance
began increasing during 2008 and has continued to increase during 2009, 2010 and 2011. The increases reflect the deterioration
of market conditions, and the increase in the recent loan experience that has resulted from management’s practice of charging
off losses on impaired one-to-four family and home equity loans in the period the impairment is identified.	 
 
Management
also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive
on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. For all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that
the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement, impairment is determined by computing
a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan’s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral
if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as individual consumer and residential
loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation. For these loans, the
allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the general allowance for loan losses policy described above. Accordingly,
except for loans modified as troubled debt restructuring, we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans
for impairment disclosures. 
 
At December 31, 2011,
the allowance for loan losses was $15.5 million or 2.98% of the total loan portfolio and 33.3% of total non-performing loans. Assessing
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective and requires making material estimates, including the amount
and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. In management’s
opinion, the allowance for loan losses represents all known and inherent loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimated
as of December 31, 2011.

Loan charge-offs in
2011 and 2010 included $6.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of partial charge-offs of non-performing one-to-four family
residential and home equity loans, representing the expected loss amount at the time the loans became non-performing. Due to delays
in the foreclosure process and declining real estate values in Florida, additional losses on these loans may be incurred in the
future if the Bank is unable to reach timely settlement with the borrower or the loan is sold in a distressed asset sale.

Investment Activities
 
General.
The Bank is required by federal regulations to maintain an amount of liquid assets, such as cash and short-term securities, for
the purposes of meeting operational needs. The Bank is also permitted to make certain other securities investments. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Commitments.” Cash flow projections
are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided.
 
The Bank is authorized
to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government
sponsored enterprises, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances,
repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federal savings associations may also invest their assets
in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that
a federally chartered savings association is otherwise authorized to make directly. See “Supervision and Regulation”
for a discussion of additional restrictions on the Bank’s investment activities.
 
The Board of Directors
has adopted an investment policy which governs the nature and extent of investment activities, and the responsibilities of management
and the board. Investment activities are directed by the Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer in coordination with the Company’s
Asset/Liability Committee. Various factors are considered when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax
consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including
the current and anticipated short and long term interest rates, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows,
and the anticipated demand for funds through deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
 
The structure of the
investment portfolio is intended to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand
is low and maximize earnings while managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
See Item 7“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability
Management and Market Risk.”
 
Investment Securities.
The Bank invests in investment securities, for example United States government sponsored enterprises and state and municipal obligations,
as part of its asset liability management strategy.
 
GAAP requires investments
be categorized as “held to maturity,” “trading securities” or “available for sale,” based on
management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. Securities are classified as held to maturity and carried
at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Securities are classified as available
for sale when they might be sold before maturity. All of the Bank’s securities are classified as available for sale.
 
Management evaluates
securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic
or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.
 

25
 

 
In evaluating OTTI,
management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less
than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected
by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will
be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline
exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in
time.
 
The amount of the OTTI
recognized in earnings depends on whether the Bank intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Bank will
be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If the Bank
intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before recovery
of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference
between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If the Bank does not intend to sell the security
and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis
less any current-period loss, the OTTI is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all
other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected
to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized
in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings
becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
 
As of December 31,
2011, the Company’s security portfolio consisted of 33 securities, 11 of which were in an unrealized loss position. Nearly
all unrealized losses are related to debt securities whose underlying collateral is residential mortgages. However, the majority
of these securities were issued by government sponsored organizations as discussed below.
 
At December 31, 2011,
approximately $125.9 million, or 99% of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities
and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to
support. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality,
and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the
securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired
at December 31, 2011.
 
The Bank recorded
other-than-temporary impairment charges of $186,000 during 2011 (See also the “Item 7-Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Securities Available for Sale).” These charges represented
credit losses from our investments in non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, caused by defaults and losses on the
underlying mortgages. As of December 31, 2011 the Bank held no non-agency collateralized mortgages.

Sources of Funds
 
General.
The Bank’s sources of funds are deposits, payment of principal and interest on loans, interest earned on or maturation of
investment securities, borrowings, and funds provided from operations.
 
Deposits.
The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to consumers with a wide range of interest rates and terms. Deposits consist of time
deposit accounts, savings, money market and demand deposit accounts. The Bank's origin as a credit union enables it to enjoy the
benefit of long-term deposit customers. As a community bank the Bank has historically paid higher rates on deposit accounts than
large regional or national banks. The Bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to
attract and retain these deposits. Additionally, the Bank has purchased time deposit accounts from brokers at costs and terms which
are comparable or better to time deposits originated in the branch offices. The Bank had $22.4 million of brokered deposits at
December 31, 2011, which was 4.4% of total deposits. See “Supervision and Regulation—Regulatory Agreements with the
Office of Thrift Supervision—Supervisory Agreements” for additional restrictions on our ability to accept brokered
deposits.
 
The variety of deposit
accounts offered has allowed the Bank to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer
demand. Pricing of deposits are managed to be consistent with overall asset/liability management, liquidity and growth objectives.
Management considers numerous factors including: (1) the need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and
other cash flow needs; (2) rates offered by market area competitors for similar deposit products; (3) current cost of funds and
yields on assets; and (4) the alternative cost of funds on a wholesale basis, in particular the cost of advances from the Federal
Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”). Interest rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as a part of its asset-liability
management actions. Based on historical experience, management believes the Bank’s deposits are a relatively stable source
of funds. Despite this stability, the Bank’s ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has
been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

FHLB
Advances. Although deposits are the primary source of funds, the Bank may utilize borrowings when it is a less costly source
of funds, and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when additional capacity is required to fund loan demand or when
they meet asset/liability management goals. Borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the FHLB of Atlanta;
however the Bank also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Atlanta. See Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Advances
from the FHLB of Atlanta may be obtained upon the security of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. These advances may
be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had $135.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding.

Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase with a carrying value of $92.8
million are secured by mortgage-backed securities as part of a structured transaction with a carrying amount of $122.2 million
at December 31, 2011, with maturities occurring from January 2014 to July 2018. Beginning in January 2009, the lender has the option
to terminate individual advances in whole each following quarter; there is no termination penalty if terminated by the lender.
There have been no early terminations. In the event the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios fall below well capitalized we may
be required to provide additional collateral.
 
The agreements with
the counterparty to $77.8 million of the total structured notes outstanding at December 31, 2011 contain certain default conditions
unique to the Bank's capital levels and supervisory relationships with its primary regulator. Specifically this counterparty has
the option to call the debt at its fair value in the event the Bank falls below adequately capitalized or receives a cease and
desist order. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank was not in default under any terms of the agreements. The estimated fair value
of the $77.8 million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2011 was $90.3 million, which would
have resulted in an estimated expense of $12.5 million at December 31, 2011 had there been an event of default, as defined. At
maturity or termination, the securities underlying the agreements will be returned to the Bank.

Other
borrowings.  Other borrowings were $0 and $5.0 million at December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively. The Company borrowed $5.0 million, at a market rate, from another financial institution in June 2010 secured
by shares of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s common stock owned by Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC. The Company’s
Chairman of the Board also serves as the president and chief executive officer and a director of the financial institution from
which the borrowing was obtained. The Company repaid the $5.0 million loan with proceeds from the second step conversion and offering
in February 2011. 
 
Subsidiary and Other Activities
 
At December 31, 2011,
the Company did not have any active subsidiaries other than Atlantic Coast Bank. The Company has one inactive subsidiary, Atlantic
Coast Development LLC, and the Bank has one inactive subsidiary, First Community Financial Services.
 
Employees
 
At
December 31, 2011, the Bank had a total of 174 employees, including 10 part-time employees. The Company’s employees are not
represented by any collective bargaining group.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 
Atlantic Coast Bank
is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to examination by the FDIC. This regulation and supervision establishes a
comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s
deposit insurance fund and depositors. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined
to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity
and sensitivity to market interest rates. Following completion of its examination, the federal agency critiques the institution’s
operations and assigns its rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). Under federal law, an institution may not disclose
its CAMELS rating to the public. Atlantic Coast Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta,
which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Atlantic Coast Bank is also regulated to a lesser
extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other
matters. The OCC examines Atlantic Coast Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating
deficiencies. Atlantic Coast Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by
federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the
form and content of Atlantic Coast Bank’s mortgage documents.
 
Any change in these
laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the OCC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank and their operations.
 
Under the recently
enacted Dodd-Frank Act, the OTS’ functions relating to federal savings associations, including rulemaking authority, were
transferred to the Comptroller of the Currency. The thrift charter has been preserved and a new Deputy Comptroller of the Currency
will supervise and examine federal savings associations and savings banks. At the same time, responsibility for the regulation
and supervision of savings and loan holding companies was transferred to the Federal Reserve, which supervises bank holding companies.
 
As a savings and loan
holding company, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve,
and is required to file certain reports with and is subject to examination by the Federal Reserve. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
Set forth below is
a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and
Atlantic Coast Bank. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and
is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
and Atlantic Coast Bank.
 

32
 

 
Regulatory Agreements with the OTS
 
Supervisory Agreements.
Effective December 10, 2010, the Company, the Bank and the OTS entered into supervisory agreements. The supervisory agreements
have been assumed by the OCC as to restrictions that relate to the Bank and by the Federal Reserve as to restrictions that relate
to the Company. The agreements provide, among other things, that:
  

•the Bank must not purchase additional bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) or increase
its investment in existing BOLI policies until the Bank’s BOLI exposure is within regulatory guidelines of 25% of total capital;
 

•the Bank must comply with regulations limiting its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits without receiving the written non-objection of the OTS, including reducing its level of brokered deposits to $52.5 million
by June 30, 2011;
 

•the Bank and the Company must comply with regulatory prior notification requirements with respect
to changes in directors and senior executive officers;
 

•the Bank will not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any other capital distributions without
the prior written approval of the OTS, and the Company cannot declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions
without prior written OTS approval;
 

•the Bank and the Company will not be permitted to enter into, renew, extend or revise any contractual
arrangement relating to compensation or benefits for any senior executive officers or directors, unless it provides 30 days prior
written notice of the proposed transaction to the OTS;
 

•the Bank may not enter into any arrangement or contract with a third party service provider that
is significant to the financial condition of the Bank or outside of its normal course of business unless the OTS has received 30
days prior written notice of such contract or arrangement and issued its written non-objection;
 

•the Bank and the Company may not make any golden parachute payment or prohibited indemnification
payment without OTS prior written approval;
 

•the Bank will not be permitted to increase its total assets during any quarter in excess of an
amount equal to the net interest credited on deposit liabilities during the prior quarter, without the prior written non-objection
of the OTS;
 

•the Bank may not engage in any transactions with affiliates without providing 30 days advance written
notice to the OTS and receiving its written non-objection; and 
   


•the Company may not incur, issue, renew or rollover any
debt or debt securities, increase any current lines of credit, guarantee the debt of any entity, or otherwise incur any additional
debt without the prior written non-objection of the OTS.

 

33
 

 
IMCR.
The OTS (the predecessor regulatory agency to the OCC) established an IMCR with the Bank on May 13, 2011 that required that the
Bank to achieve a Tier 1(core) capital ratio of 6.25% as of June 30, 2011 and 7.0% as of September 30, 2011. While we achieved
the required Tier 1(core) capital ratio as of June 30, 2011, the Bank was not in compliance with the IMCR as of September 30, 2011,
and as of December 31, 2011 had a Tier 1(core) capital ratio of 5.83%. The OCC has the authority to subject the Bank to more restrictive
enforcement orders including cease and desist orders, formal actions or other directives that may require the Bank to meet and
maintain capital levels at amounts higher than the IMCR.
 
Memorandum of
Understanding. In August 2009, Atlantic Coast Bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the OTS addressing certain
areas of its operations. This Memorandum has been superseded by the Supervisory Agreements.
 
New Federal Legislation
 
Congress has enacted
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and
affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank
Act eliminated the Bank’s former primary federal regulator, the OTS, and requires Atlantic Coast Bank to be regulated by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the primary federal regulator for national banks). The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like Atlantic
Coast Financial Corporation in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires
the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent
as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital
instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the
proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010
by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. Savings and loan holding companies are subject
to a five year transition period before the holding company capital requirement will apply. The legislation also establishes a
floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal
banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet
activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to
all banks and savings institutions such as Atlantic Coast Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or
abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all
banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in
assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available
for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal
consumer protection laws.
 

34
 

 
The legislation also
broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible
equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance
for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, and non-interest bearing
transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to give
stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and change-in-control payments. The legislation also directs the Federal
Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether
the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage
of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees
and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. Many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank involve delayed effective
dates and/or require implementing regulations. Accordingly, it will be some time before management can assess the full impact on
operations. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in an increased regulatory
burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for Atlantic Coast Bank and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation.
 
Federal Banking Regulation
  
Business Activities.
A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and
the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, Atlantic Coast Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential
and nonresidential real estate, commercial business loans and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other
assets, subject to applicable limits. Atlantic Coast Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise
permissible for Atlantic Coast Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. The Dodd-Frank Act
authorizes, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts effective July 21, 2011.
 
Capital Requirements.
OCC regulations require savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 4% leverage ratio
(3% for savings banks receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS rating system) and an 8% risk-based capital ratio.
 
The risk-based capital
standard for savings banks requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary
capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets,
including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 100%, assigned by the OCC, based on
the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained
earnings), certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary
capital currently include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated
debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets
and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Overall, the
amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, a savings bank
that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of
the purchaser’s recourse to the savings bank. Atlantic Coast Bank does not typically engage in asset sales.
 

35
 

 
Loans-to-One
Borrower.  Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers
in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and
surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December
31, 2011, Atlantic Coast Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Qualified Thrift
Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, Atlantic Coast Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,”
test. Under the QTL test, Atlantic Coast Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified
thrift investments” in at least nine months of the most recent 12 months. “Portfolio assets” generally means
total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible
assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.
 
“Qualified thrift
investments” include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes,
including certain mortgage-backed and related securities, and loans for personal, family, household and certain other purposes
up to a limit of 20% of portfolio assets. “Qualified thrift investments” also include 100% of an institution’s
credit card loans, education loans and small business loans. Atlantic Coast Bank also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as
a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 
A savings bank that
fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act makes noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December
31, 2011, Atlantic Coast Bank held 80.6% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments,” and
satisfied this test.
 
Capital Distributions.
OCC regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and
other transactions charged to the capital account. A savings bank must file an application for approval of a capital distribution
if:
 

·the total capital distributions for the
applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank’s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank’s
retained net income for the preceding two years; 
 

·the savings bank would not be at least
adequately capitalized following the distribution;
 

·the distribution would violate any applicable
statute, regulation, agreement or OCC-imposed condition; or
 

·the savings bank is not eligible for expedited
treatment of its filings.
 
Even if an application
is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the Federal
Reserve at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 

36
 

 
The OCC or Federal
Reserve may disapprove a notice or application if:
 

·the savings bank would be undercapitalized
following the distribution;
 

·the proposed capital distribution raises
safety and soundness concerns; or
 

·the capital distribution would violate
a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
 
In addition, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution, if after making such
distribution the institution would be undercapitalized.
 
Liquidity.
A federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation.
 
Community Reinvestment
Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations
of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection
with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the association’s record of compliance with
the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating
in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An association’s failure to comply
with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such
as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the
Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department
of Justice. Atlantic Coast Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal
examination.
 
Transactions
with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited
by OCC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W. An affiliate is a
company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Atlantic Coast
Bank. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation will be an affiliate of Atlantic Coast Bank. In general, loan transactions between an
insured depository institution and its affiliate are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard,
transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliate are limited to 10% of the institution’s unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for
transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral in specified amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the
transaction must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the association. In addition, OCC regulations
prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank
holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates
must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable
to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The OCC requires savings banks to maintain detailed records
of all transactions with affiliates.
 

37
 

 
Atlantic Coast Bank’s
authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such
persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the
Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms
that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing
for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present
other unfavorable features, and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually
and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Atlantic Coast Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions
of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Atlantic Coast Bank’s board of directors. Atlantic Coast Bank is
in compliance with Regulation O.
 
Enforcement.
The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action
against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly
or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action
by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors
of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and
actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high
as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement
action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to
take action under specified circumstances.
 
Standards for
Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository
institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation,
credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as
the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and
Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness
standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital
becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting,
loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking
agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution
to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards,
the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan.
 

38
 

 
Prompt Corrective
Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory
actions against undercapitalized savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories
based on the savings bank’s capital:
 

·well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage
capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% total risk-based capital);
 

·adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage
capital (3% for savings banks with a composite examination rating of 1), 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital);

 

·undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage
capital (3% for savings banks with a composite examination rating of 1), 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 8% total risk-based capital);

 

·significantly undercapitalized (less than
6% total risk-based capital, 3% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 3% leverage capital); or
 

·critically undercapitalized (less than
2% tangible capital).
 
Generally, the OCC
is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific
time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date
a savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically
undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment
of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance
with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings
bank will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not
appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings bank. Any holding company for the savings bank required to submit
a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of a savings bank’s assets at the time it
was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized
status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status
for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the
guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the
savings bank, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees,
and increase assets or expand operations.  The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions
against undercapitalized savings banks, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers
and directors.
 
At December 31,
2011, Atlantic Coast Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized” under the OCC’s prompt
corrective action regulations. However, Atlantic Coast Bank is also subject to an IMCR, which is discussed more fully at Item
1A – Risk Factors.
 

39
 




 
Insurance of
Deposit Accounts. Atlantic Coast Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC.
Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC. In view of the recent economic crisis, the FDIC temporarily increased the
general individual deposit insurance available on deposit accounts from $100,000 to $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act made that level
of coverage permanent retroactive to January 1, 2008. In addition, pursuant to a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, certain non-interest-bearing
transaction accounts are fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until December 31, 2012.
 
The FDIC imposes an
assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions
are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s
assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions
deemed less risky paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 ½ to 45
basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly,
except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The
FDIC’s current system represents a change, effective April 1, 2011 and required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice
of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.
 
In 2009, the FDIC,
in response to pressures on the Deposit Insurance Fund caused by bank and savings association failures, required all insured depository
institutions to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The estimated
assessments were based on assumptions established by the FDIC, including an assumed 5% annual growth rate and certain assumed assessment
rate increases. That pre-payment, which was due on December 30, 2009 and amounted to $6.4 million for Atlantic Coast Bank, was
recorded as a prepaid expense at December 31, 2009 and is being amortized to expense over three years. Any unused prepaid assessments
would be returned to the institution in June 2013.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured
deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion
or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the
discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 2%.
 
The FDIC has authority
to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results
of operations of Atlantic Coast Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits
may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the
FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
In addition to the
FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the
FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize
the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 68 basis points for each $100 in domestic
deposits maintained at an institution.

Prohibitions
Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to
or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition
that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor
of the institution.
 
Federal Home
Loan Bank System. Atlantic Coast Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal
Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well
as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, Atlantic Coast Bank
is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2011, Atlantic Coast
Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
 
Federal Reserve System
 
Federal Reserve Board
regulations require savings banks to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts, such as negotiable
order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts. At December 31, 2011, Atlantic Coast Bank was in compliance with these reserve
requirements.
 
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other
charges collected or contracted for by Atlantic Coast Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest
rates. Atlantic Coast Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
 

·Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures
of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
 

·Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring
financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution
is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
 

·Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
 

·Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the
use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
 

·Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the
manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
 

·Truth in Savings Act; and
 

·Rules and regulations of the various federal
agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
 

41
 

 
The operations of Atlantic
Coast Bank also are subject to the:
 

·Right to Financial Privacy Act, which
imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative
subpoenas of financial records;
 

·Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation
E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights
and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
 

·Check Clearing for the 21st
Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and
copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
 

·The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings
banks to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls
to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing
compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control
regulations; and
 

·The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places
limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically,
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide
such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out”
of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
 
Holding Company Regulation
  
General.
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is a unitary savings and loan holding company, subject to regulation and supervision by the
Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and its non-savings institution
subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined
to be a risk to Atlantic Coast Bank.
 
Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation’s activities are limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies or for multiple savings
and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting
equity securities and insurance, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings
and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the
Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, and certain additional activities authorized by
Federal Reserve regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits
a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring control of another
savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. It also prohibits the acquisition
or retention of, with specified exceptions, more than 5% of the equity securities of a company engaged in activities that are not
closely related to banking or financial in nature or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured.
In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve must consider the financial
and managerial resources and future prospects of the savings institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to
the insurance fund, and the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 

42
 

 
Capital.
Savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however,
required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies
that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital as
is currently the case with bank holding companies. Instruments issued by May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with
consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. There is a five-year transition period (from the July 21, 2010 effective date of the
Dodd-Frank Act) before the capital requirements will apply to savings and loan holding companies. The Company had no cumulative
preferred stock or trust preferred securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
Source of Strength.
The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The
regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of
strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Federal Reserve policies also provide that holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the
prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset
quality and overall financial condition.
 
Dividends. The
Bank must notify the OCC thirty (30) days before declaring any dividend to the Company. The financial impact of a holding company
on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the OCC and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities
or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution.
 
Federal Securities Laws
 
Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is subject
to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
 
The registration under
the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s public offering does
not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation are subject
to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation meets the current
public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with
those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in
any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, or the average weekly
volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation may
permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933.
 

43
 

 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced
and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer will be required to certify that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have
several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly
evaluating the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s
auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about internal control over financial reporting; and they have included
information in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in internal
control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The
Company has existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and it is further enhancing and
documenting such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 
Federal Taxation
  
General.
Atlantic Coast Bank and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner
as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize
certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Atlantic Coast
Financial Corporation or Atlantic Coast Bank.
 
Method of Accounting.
For federal income tax purposes, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual
method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
 
Alternative Minimum
Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a
rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income”
or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the
regular income tax. Net operating losses generally can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of AMT may be used as
credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank have been
subject to the AMT and have $677,000 available as credits for carryover.
 
Net Operating
Loss Carryovers.  Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable
years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.  However, as a result of recent legislation, subject to certain limitations,
the carryback period for net operating losses incurred in 2008 or 2009 (but not both years) has been expanded to five years. 
At December 31, 2011, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank have $45.7 million in net operating loss carryforwards
for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in 2019. See “Item IA. Risk Factors—We may not be able to realize
our deferred tax asset.”
 

44
 

 
Corporate Dividends-Received
Deduction. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received
from Atlantic Coast Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary.
 
State Taxation
 
Net Operating
Loss Carryovers. A corporation may carry back Georgia net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward
to the succeeding 20 taxable years; however, net operating losses in Florida may only be carried forward for 20 taxable years.
Through December 31, 2011, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank had a Florida and Georgia net operating
loss carryforward of $70.9 million, which begins to expire in 2026.
 
Income
Taxation. Atlantic Coast
Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank are subject to Georgia corporate income tax which is assessed at the rate of 6.00%.
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank are subject to Florida corporate income tax which is assessed at
the rate of 5.50%. For both states, taxable income generally means federal taxable income subject to certain modifications provided
for in the applicable state statutes. 
 
Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank are not currently under audit with respect to their state income tax returns and their state
income tax returns have not been audited for the past five years.
 
As a Maryland business
corporation, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees to the State of Maryland.

Item
1A Risk Factors
 
Our
business, and an investment in our common stock, involves risks. Summarized below are the risk factors which management believe
are material to our business and could negatively affect operating results, financial condition and the trading value of our common
stock. Other risks factors not currently known to management, or risk factors that are currently deemed to be immaterial or unlikely,
also could adversely affect the business. In assessing the following risk factors, the reader should also refer to the other information
contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
If the Bank’s non-performing assets increase, the Bank’s
earnings will suffer. 
 
At December 31, 2011,
our non-performing assets totaled $52.5 million, or 6.65% of total assets, and have increased steadily since December 31, 2007,
when non-performing assets were $9.6 million or 1.03% of total assets. Our non-performing assets may continue to increase in future
periods. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-performing
loans or real estate owned. We must establish an allowance for loan losses for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both
probable and reasonably estimable through current period provisions for loan losses, which are recorded as a charge to income.
From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market
values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes,
insurance and maintenance related to other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active
involvement of management, which can distract them from our overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities.
 
The Bank and the Company entered into
supervisory agreements with the OTS, which limit their operations and may adversely affect their financial performance. 
 
Effective December
10, 2010, the Company, the Bank and the OTS entered into supervisory agreements. The supervisory agreements have been assumed by
the OCC as to restrictions that relate to the Bank and by the Federal Reserve as to restrictions that relate to the Company. The
agreements provide, among other things, that:
 

•the Bank must not purchase additional bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) or increase
its investment in existing BOLI policies until the Bank’s BOLI exposure is within regulatory guidelines of 25% of total capital;
 

•the Bank must comply with regulations limiting its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits without receiving the written non-objection of the OTS, including reducing its level of brokered deposits to $52.5 million
by June 30, 2011;
 

•the Bank and the Company must comply with regulatory prior notification requirements with respect
to changes in directors and senior executive officers;
 

•the Bank will not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any other capital distributions without
the prior written approval of the OTS, and the Company cannot declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions
without prior written OTS approval;
 

46
 

 

•the Bank and the Company will not be permitted to enter into, renew, extend or revise any contractual
arrangement relating to compensation or benefits for any senior executive officers or directors, unless it provides 30 days prior
written notice of the proposed transaction to the OTS;
 

•the Bank may not enter into any arrangement or contract with a third party service provider that
is significant to the financial condition of the Bank or outside of its normal course of business unless the OTS has received 30
days prior written notice of such contract or arrangement and issued its written non-objection;
 

•the Bank and the Company may not make any golden parachute payment or prohibited indemnification
payment without OTS prior written approval;
 

•the Bank will not be permitted to increase its total assets during any quarter in excess of an
amount equal to the net interest credited on deposit liabilities during the prior quarter, without the prior written non-objection
of the OTS;
 

•the Bank may not engage in any transactions with affiliates without providing 30 days advance written
notice to the OTS and receiving its written non-objection; and
 

•the Company may not incur, issue, renew or rollover any debt or debt securities, increase any current
lines of credit, guarantee the debt of any entity, or otherwise incur any additional debt without the prior written non-objection
of the OTS.
 
The restriction on
growth will affect the Bank’s ability to generate new loans or make investments without reducing other assets on its balance
sheet, thereby potentially adversely affecting the Company’s income. The restriction on brokered deposits may affect the
Bank’s ability to have sufficient liquid assets for the Bank’s operations or require it to pay higher rates on retail
deposits to replace the Bank’s use of brokered deposits. These limitations and the other restrictions noted above will limit
the Company’s operations, which may adversely affect its financial performance.
 
In the event the Company
or the Bank are in material non-compliance with the terms of the supervisory agreements and subject to regulatory discretion, the
Federal Reserve and/or the OCC has the authority to subject them to the terms of a more restrictive enforcement order such as a
cease and desist order, to impose civil money penalties on them and their directors and officers, and to remove directors and officers
from their positions with Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank.
 
The Bank is not in compliance with an
Individual Minimum Capital Requirement(IMCR) established by the OTS (the predecessor regulatory agency to the OCC) and as a result
may become subject to further regulatory restrictions in the future.
 
The OTS (the predecessor
regulatory agency to the OCC) established an IMCR with the Bank on May 13, 2011 that required that the Bank achieve and maintain
a Tier 1 (core) capital ratio of 6.25% as of June 30, 2011 and 7.0% as of September 30, 2011. While we achieved the required Tier
1(core) capital ratio as of June 30, 2011, the Bank was not in compliance with the IMCR as of September 30, 2011, and as of December
31, 2011 had a Tier 1(core) capital ratio of 5.83%. The OCC has the authority to subject the Bank to more restrictive enforcement
orders including cease and desist orders, formal actions or other directives that may trigger the call provisions of the reverse
repurchase agreements discussed below and that may require the Bank to meet and maintain capital levels at amounts higher than
the IMCR. In order to meet such regulatory orders to raise capital the Company may have to take actions which could dilute current
stockholders or otherwise negatively affect current stockholders’ investment.
 

47
 

 
The Company has engaged Stifel Nicolaus
Weisel to help it review its strategic alternatives. The Company may not be successful in its strategic alternatives review process.
 
In light of current
economic and market conditions, as well as recent operating results, the Company's Board of Directors has begun a review of its
strategic alternatives and has authorized Stifel Nicolaus Weisel to explore such alternatives, including a potential business combination
in addition to the previously disclosed potential rights offering.
 
The Board of Directors
will review all possible strategic alternatives and weigh the relative benefits of such alternatives to stockholders. The Company
does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the progress of its strategic alternatives review process until such time
as the Board of Directors approves or completes a transaction or otherwise determines that further disclosure is appropriate. The
Company may not be able to successfully complete a business combination or a capital-raising transaction or complete such a transaction .
 
The Bank’s borrowings from securities
sold under agreements to repurchase materially impacts the Bank’s net interest margin and exposes the Bank’s capital
and results of operations to significant risk.
 
The Bank
has $92.8 million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“reverse repo”) comprised of structured
notes with two different counterparties in amounts totaling $77.8 million and $15.0 million, respectively. The
individual agreements take the form of term repurchase agreements with maturities beginning in 2014 and final maturities in
2018. The interest rate terms are variable based on an index tied to 3 month LIBOR or the counterparty has an
option to lock in interest rates at a fixed rate each quarter. Due to the low LIBOR interest rate environment that has
existed over the last two years, each of the counterparties has exercised their options to fix the rate at ceiling maximums.
The weighted average rate of the reverse repos as of December 31, 2011 was 5.10%, and the weighted average maturity was 54
months.
 
Due to the unusually
low long term interest rate environment being promoted by the Federal Reserve, yields on the investment securities collateralizing
the reverse repos have been decreasing and at December 31, 2011 the weighted average yield on these securities was approximately
2.50%. Given the announced intentions of the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at their current levels until 2014, the reverse
repo transactions are expected to have a negative impact to our net interest margin and represent a barrier to returning to profitability.
The Bank has the option to terminate the reverse repos at the market rate of the debt. As of December 31, 2011, the market rate
of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by $15.3 million.
 

48
 

 
The agreements with
the counterparty of the $77.8 million reverse repo contain default conditions which if triggered would materially impact the Bank’s
capital and results of operations. In the event the Bank becomes less than adequately capitalized or receives a cease and desist
order from the OCC the counterparty has the option to terminate the reverse repos at the market rate of the debt. As of December
31, 2011 the market rate of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by $12.5 million.
 
The Company has experienced net losses
for each of the last three fiscal years and we may not return to profitability in the near future.
 
The Company has experienced
net losses of $10.3 million, $14.2 million and $29.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The losses have been primarily caused by a significant increase in non-performing assets, which necessitated a provision for loan
losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to
a provision of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We charged off $13.2 million of loans during the year ended
December 31, 2011, $21.7 million of loans during 2010 and $21.7 million of loans during 2009. Non-performing loans (generally loans
90 days or more past due in principal or interest payments) increased to $46.6 million, or 8.94% of total loans at December 31,
2011, compared to $28.1 million, or 4.99% of total loans at December 31, 2010. We experienced other-than- temporary impairment
losses in our investment portfolio of $186,000 and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, management deemed it appropriate to write off our entire goodwill balance of
$2.8 million, and establish a valuation allowance of 100% of our net deferred tax asset. As a result of these factors and other
conditions such as weakness in our local economy, we may not be able to generate sustainable net income or achieve profitability
in the near future.
 
We may be unable to successfully implement
our business strategy and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.
 
Our future success
will depend upon management’s ability to successfully implement its business strategy, which includes expanding warehouse
lending, an emphasis on originating loans to small businesses, including loans guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration,
expense reduction and transitioning the Bank to a retail community banking model. While we believe we have the management resources
and internal systems in place to successfully implement our strategy, it will take time and additional capital to fully implement
our strategy. We expect that it may take a significant period of time before we can achieve the intended results of our business
strategy. During the period we are implementing our plan our results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, even
if our strategy is successfully implemented, it may not produce positive results.
 

Additionally, future success in the expansion of the warehouse
and small business lending platforms as well as the ongoing development of the retail community banking model will depend on management’s
ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated employees. An improving job market along with competition for banking
talent from institutions with greater financial resources could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain adequate talent
and adversely affect our business and profitability.
 

 

49
 

 
Future capital raises are subject to
regulatory approval which could slow down or prevent timely acquisition of additional capital.
 
Under conditions established
by the OTS upon approval of the Company’s second step conversion, the Company must obtain approval of any stock offering
(public or private) conducted for 18 months after the completion of the second step conversion on February 3, 2011 from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In addition, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta the Company is prohibited
from selling more than a 10% ownership interest in the Company for three years following the second step conversion.
 
The geographic concentration in loans
secured by one-to-four family residential real estate may increase credit losses, which could increase the level of provision for
loan losses.
 
As of December 31,
2011, approximately 61.3% of the total loan portfolio was secured by first or second liens on one-to-four family residential property,
primarily in southeastern Georgia and northeastern Florida. The Bank had $189.6 million, or 36.8%, of our loan portfolio secured
by one-to-four family residential property in Florida and $84.9 million, or 16.5%, of such properties in Georgia. The downturn
in the local and national economy beginning in 2008, through 2011, particularly affecting real estate values and employment, have
adversely affected our loan customers’ ability to repay their loans. In the event we are required to foreclose on a property
securing a mortgage loans or pursue other remedies in order to protect our investment, we may not be able to recover funds in an
amount equal to any remaining loan balance as a result of prevailing economic conditions, real estate values and other factors
associated with the ownership of real property. In particular, the foreclosure process in Florida often takes up to 2 years to
complete, thereby potentially increasing our risk of loss due to the property’s deterioration in value during this period.
As a result, the market value of the real estate or other collateral underlying the loans may not, at any given time, be sufficient
to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans. Consequently, we would sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher
provision for loan loss expense.
  
The
loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our number of commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and multi-family
loans and consumer loans, which could increase the level of provision for loan losses.
 
The
outstanding commercial real estate, commercial business, construction, multi-family, and manufactured home, automobile and other
consumer loans accounted for approximately 38.3% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Generally, management considers
these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one-to-four family, owner occupied
residential properties. Historically, these loans have had higher risks than loans secured by residential real estate for the following
reasons:
 

·Commercial Real Estate and Commercial
Business Loans.  Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient
to cover operating expenses and debt service. This risk has been exacerbated by the extended recession in commercial real estate
and commercial land values, particularly in our markets.
 

·Commercial and Multi-Family Construction
Loans.  Repayment is dependent upon the completion of the project and income being generated by the rental property or
business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.
 

50
 

 

·Single Family Construction Loans.
 Repayment is dependent upon the successful completion of the project and the ability of the contractor or builder to repay
the loan from the sale of the property or obtaining permanent financing.
 

·Multi-Family Real Estate Loans.
 Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses
and debt service.  
   


·Consumer Loans.  Consumer
loans (such as automobile and manufactured home loans) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate
source of repayment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.
 
If these non-residential loans become non-performing,
we may have to increase our provision for loan losses which would negatively affect our results of operations.
 
The loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to portfolio
lending during a period of rising real estate values, high sales volume activity and historically low interest rate environment.
 
Much of the Bank’s
portfolio lending is in one-to-four family residential properties generally located throughout southeastern Georgia and northeastern
Florida. As a result of lending during a period of rising real estate values and historically low interest rates, a significant
portion of the loan portfolio is potentially under-collateralized given the recent significant decline in real estate values. Sufficient
time has not elapsed to ascertain the magnitude of potential losses resulting from lending during a period of intense changes in
the real estate market. Additionally, given the historically low interest rate environment over this same period, the adjustable
rate loans have not been subject to an interest rate environment that causes them to adjust to the maximum level and may involve
repayment risks resulting from potentially increasing payment obligations by borrowers as a result of re-pricing. At December 31,
2011, there were $217.8 million in adjustable rate loans, which made up 42.3% of the loan portfolio.
 
High loan-to-value
ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio expose us to greater risk of loss.
 
Many of our residential
mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because of the decline
in home values in our market areas. The pressure on home values has increased due to the uncertainty caused by the U.S. government’s
lawsuit against larger national loan servicers and the impact of distressed asset sales by U.S. government agency mortgage lenders.
Residential loans with high loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined
loan-to-value ratios and, therefore, may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers
sell their homes, such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale. As a result, these loans may experience
higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses.
 

51
 

 
If the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover
actual losses, income and capital will be negatively affected.
 
The Bank’s allowance
for loan losses was $15.5 million, or 2.98% of total loans, at December 31, 2011. In the event loan customers do not repay their
loans according to their terms and the collateral security for the payments of these loans is insufficient to pay any remaining
loan balance, the Bank may experience significant loan losses. Such credit risk is inherent in the lending business, and failure
to adequately assess such credit risk could have a material adverse affect on the Bank’s financial condition and results
of operations. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the
creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of
many of the loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loan portfolio and our historical
loss and delinquency experience, as well as overall economic conditions. For larger balance non-homogeneous real estate loans the
estimate of impairment is based on the underlying collateral if collateral dependent, and if such loans are not collateral dependent,
the estimate of impairment is based on a cash flow analysis. If management’s assumptions are incorrect, the allowance for
loan losses may be insufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses is also periodically reviewed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who may require us
to increase the amount. Additions to the allowance for loans losses would be made through increased provisions for loan losses
and would negatively affect our results of operations.
 
Interest rate volatility could significantly reduce the Bank’s
profitability.
 
The Bank’s earnings
largely depend on the relationship between the yield on its earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the
cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, commonly known as the net interest margin, is susceptible
to significant fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors that influence the yields and rates, and the volume
and mix of the Bank’s interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities.
 
Interest rate risk
can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the Bank's net interest income.
Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities.
The bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities re-price or mature more slowly or
more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a
material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
The Bank's interest
rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of its balance sheet and off-balance
sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured
in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income, is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques
under multiple interest rate scenarios. Management's objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the
interest rate risk profile inherent in the Bank's balance sheet.
 

52
 

 
Future changes in interest rates could
impact our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The
Federal Reserve Board maintained the federal funds rate at the historically low rate of 0.25% during 2011 and 2010. The federal
funds rate has a direct correlation to general rates of interest, including our interest-bearing deposits. Our mix of asset and
liabilities are considered to be sensitive to interest rate changes. Generally, customers may prepay the principal
amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speed at which such prepayments occur, as well as the amount of such prepayments,
are within Bank customers’ discretion. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and the Bank is unable to
lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, the Bank’s interest income
will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations
and financial condition. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, net interest income might be reduced
because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning
assets, including loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In addition, rising interest rates may negatively affect income
because higher rates may reduce the demand for loans and the value of mortgage-related and investment securities.
  
The Bank has $227.8
million in long-term borrowings, comprised of $135.0 million of FHLB advances and $92.8 million of reverse repurchase agreements,
with the earliest maturities beginning in 2013 and final maturities occurring in 2018. The weighted average rate of the long-term
borrowings as of December 31, 2011 was 4.32%, and accounted for approximately 62% of interest expense for the year ended December
31, 2011. Given the announced intentions of the Federal Reserve Bank to hold interest rates at their current levels until 2014,
the long term borrowings are expected to have a negative impact to the net interest margin.
 
Operating expenses are high as a percentage
of our net interest income and non-interest income, making it more difficult to maintain profitability.
 
Non-interest expense,
which consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our business, represents a high percentage of the income we generate.
The cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio, which represents non-interest expense divided by the sum
of our net interest income and our non-interest income. If we are able to lower our efficiency ratio, our ability to generate income
from our operations will be more effective. For the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009, our efficiency ratio was 85.7%, 78.0% and 93.6%, respectively. Generally, this means we spent $0.86, $0.78 and $0.94 during
the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 to generate $1.00 of income
 
If
economic conditions continue to deteriorate or the economic recovery remains slow over an extended period of time in our primary
market areas of Jacksonville, Florida and Ware County, Georgia, our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely
impacted as borrowers’ ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases.
 
Financial results may
be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest
rates, which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of
the federal and the Georgia and Florida state governments and other significant external events. We held approximately 24.0% of
the deposits in Ware County, the county in which Waycross, Georgia is located as of December 31, 2011. We also have approximately
1.0% of the deposits in the Jacksonville, Florida, metropolitan area as of December 31, 2011. Additionally, our market share of
loans in Ware County is significantly greater than our share of the loan market in the Jacksonville metropolitan area. As a result
of the concentration in Ware County, we may be more susceptible to adverse market conditions in that market. Due to the significant
portion of real estate loans in the loan portfolio, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property
used as collateral. At December 31, 2011, $189.6 million, or 36.8%, of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate secured loans
in Florida and $84.9 million, or 16.5%, of such loans consisted of real estate secured loans in Georgia. Adverse changes in the
economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have
an adverse impact on earnings. The unemployment rate for the Jacksonville, Florida metropolitan area was an estimated 9.2% as of
December 31, 2011.
 

53
 

 
The United States economy remains weak
and unemployment levels are high. Continuing economic weakness, particularly in our geographic market area, will adversely affect
our business and financial results.
 
The United States experienced
a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009, the effects of which have continued through 2011. Recent growth has been slow and
unemployment remains at high levels and as a result economic recovery is expected to be slow. Loan portfolio quality has deteriorated
at many financial institutions reflecting, in part, the weak United States economy and high unemployment rates. In addition, the
value of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages has declined and may continue to decline. The
real estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction,
residential and commercial mortgage loans. Bank and bank holding company stock prices have declined substantially, and it is significantly
more difficult for banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow funds.
 
Future negative developments
in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which
we do business, the market for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. We
could experience reduced demand for our products and services, increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets or foreclosures,
and the collateral for our loans may decline further in value. Moreover, future declines in the stock market in general, or stock
values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically, could adversely affect our stock performance.
 
The slowing and uncertain economy in
Florida has negatively impacted our ability to grow loans in our primary market area, and combined with strong competition, may
further reduce our ability to obtain loans and also decrease our yield on loans.
 
From 2000 to mid-2007,
the Jacksonville metropolitan area had been one of the fastest growing economies in the United States. The area experienced substantial
growth in population, new business formation and public works spending. Due to the considerable slowing of economic growth and
migration into our market area since mid-2007 and the resulting downturn in the real estate market, management believes growth
in our market area will be moderate in the near term. Growth in the first mortgage loan portfolio has been negatively impacted
by a slowing in existing and new home sales activity in our markets. A decrease in existing and new home sales decreases lending
opportunities, and may negatively affect our income.
 
In addition, we are
located in a competitive market that affects our ability to obtain loans through origination or purchase as well as originating
them at rates that provide an attractive yield. Competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers, commercial banks,
other thrift institutions, nationally based homebuilders and credit unions. Internet based lenders have also become a greater competitive
factor in recent years. Such competition for the origination and purchase of loans may limit future growth and earnings prospects.
 

54
 

 
Strong
competition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and also increase our cost of funds.
 
The Bank operates in
a very competitive market for the attraction of deposits, the primary source of our funding. Historically, our most direct competition
for deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks and thrift institutions within our primary market
areas. In recent years competition has also come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the internet. Such
competitors have the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs and substantially greater resources and lending limits
and may offer services we do not provide. Particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, we have
faced significant competition for investors’ funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government
securities. During periods of regularly increasing interest rates, competition for interest-bearing deposits increases as customers,
particularly time deposit customers, tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the
market. As a result, Atlantic Coast Bank incurs a higher cost of funds in an effort to attract and retain customer deposits. We
strive to grow our lower cost deposits, such as non-interest-bearing checking accounts, in order to reduce our cost of funds.
 
The Company may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset.
 
The Company recognizes
deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
assets and liabilities. However, at December 31, 2011, we had no net deferred tax asset. In 2009, we established a valuation allowance
for our net federal and state deferred tax asset after evaluating the positive and negative evidence under Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“GAAP”). GAAP requires more weight be given to objective evidence, and since realization is dependent on
future operating results, our three year cumulative operating loss carried more weight than forecasted earnings.
 
Management regularly
reviews the deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected
timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of the deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient
taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income. The net deferred tax asset
at December 31, 2011 will not become fully realizable until our expected future earnings will support realization of the asset.
In addition, future capital raises or transactions that result in a change in control could trigger the application of certain
tax laws which materially limit the utilization of deferred tax asset. This is a complex analysis and requires us to make certain
judgments in determining the annual limitation. Although it is currently not shown as an asset, it is possible that we could ultimately
lose a significant portion of the deferred tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings
and capital.
 
Wholesale funding sources may be unavailable to replace deposits
at maturity and support our liquidity needs or growth.
 
The Bank must maintain
sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of
funding sources in addition to non-maturity deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. Ongoing financial
difficulties and restrictions by the OCC may limit these sources, which include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from
the sale of loans and liquidity resources of the holding company.  At December 31, 2011, we had $135.0 million of Federal
Home Loan Bank advances outstanding, and the remaining borrowing capacity was $63.8 million.
 

55
 

 
In the past brokered
deposits have been solicited as a source of funds. However, under the Supervisory Agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision
entered into in December 2010, Atlantic Coast Bank had to reduce the level of its brokered deposits to $52.5 million by June 30,
2011. We had $22.4 million of brokered deposits at December 31, 2011, which was 4.4% of total deposits. As our brokered deposits
mature, we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not
being able to replace those deposits as they mature could adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher interest rates to replace
those deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin and our operating results.
 
Our financial flexibility
will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate
future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support
future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability
would be adversely affected.
 
Atlantic Coast Bank operates in a highly
regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
 
Atlantic Coast Bank
is currently subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures Atlantic Coast Bank’s deposits. As a savings and loan holding
company, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is currently subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which financial institutions and their holding companies may
engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities
have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions
on the operations of financial institutions, the classification of assets by financial institutions and the adequacy of financial
institutions’ allowance for loan losses. New financial reform legislation was enacted in 2010 by Congress that will change
the bank regulatory framework, create an independent consumer protection bureau that will assume the consumer protection responsibilities
of the various federal banking agencies, and establish more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The
legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and
bank holding companies. Further changes in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations,
or legislation, could have a material impact on Atlantic Coast Bank and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation.
 
Atlantic Coast Bank’s
operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and local governmental authorities, and are subject
to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on operations. These laws,
rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities. In the future, changes to existing laws,
rules and regulations, or any other new laws, rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise
adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.
 

56
 

 
Financial reform legislation enacted
by Congress eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision and, among other things, will tighten capital standards, created a new
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.

  
Congress enacted the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) in July 2010, which significantly
changed the current bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial
institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated our previous primary federal regulator, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, and required Atlantic Coast Bank to be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the primary federal
regulator for national banks). The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to supervise
and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, in addition to bank holding companies
which it currently regulates. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board’s current regulations applicable to bank holding companies,
including holding company capital requirements, apply to savings and loan holding companies like Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation.
These capital requirements are substantially similar to the capital requirements currently applicable to Atlantic Coast Bank, but
will not be applicable to Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation for five years. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Federal Reserve
Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository
subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to
be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository
institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new
leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including
risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to
all banks and savings institutions such as Atlantic Coast Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or
abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all
banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in
assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available
for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal
consumer protection laws.
 
The legislation also
broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average
consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased
the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive
to January 1, 2008, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. Lastly,
the Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding
vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Federal
Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether
the company is publicly traded or not.
 

57
 

 
It is difficult to
predict at this time what effect the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks with regards to
the lending and credit practices of such banks. Moreover, the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous
and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years. Although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot
be determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those relating to the
new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will increase our operating and compliance costs.
 
Changes in laws and regulations and
the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income. 
 
In response to the
financial crisis of 2008 and early 2009, Congress has taken actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity
in financial institutions, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit
accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations are likely to have a significant effect on the financial services industry,
which are likely to increase operating costs and reduce profitability. In addition, there have been proposals made by members of
Congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay on their mortgage
loans and limit an institution’s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral.
 
The potential exists
for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity
standards. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations,
and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. Bank regulatory agencies,
such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, govern the activities in which
we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors. In addition,
new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and
investments, the fees we can charge, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Legislative proposals limiting our rights
as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.
 
Risks Relating to an Investment in
our Common Stock
 
The Company’s stock price may
be volatile due to limited trading volume. 
 
The Company’s
common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in the Company’s common stock
is relatively small, approximately 8,000 shares per day in 2011, and sometimes significantly less than that. As a result, trades
involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may
be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price. If
the Company’s Market Value of Publicly Held Shares as defined under NASDAQ rules falls
below $5.0 million or the price per share of the common stock falls below $1.00 for a specified amount of time under Nasdaq rules,
the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the receipt of the notification from Nasdaq to regain compliance. If the Company
is unable to regain compliance, the Company may have to transfer its listing to the NASDAQ Capital Market or begin trading on the
over-the-counter bulletin board which is not a stock exchange. 
 

58
 

 
The Company’s ability to pay dividends
is limited. 
 
Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation’s ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory requirements and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated
capital to meet the capital needs of the business, including capital needs related to future growth. The primary source of income
is the payment of dividends from Atlantic Coast Bank to the Company. Atlantic Coast Bank, in turn, is subject to regulatory requirements
potentially limiting its ability to pay such dividends and by the need to maintain sufficient capital for its operations and obligations.
In addition, the Company and Bank are prohibited from paying dividends by the terms of the Supervisory Agreements entered into
with our regulators. Thus, there can be no assurance the Company will pay dividends to common stockholders, no assurance as to
the amount or timing of any such dividends, and no assurance such dividends, if and when paid, will be maintained, at the same
level or at all, in future periods. On September 25, 2009, the Company announced that it had suspended its regular quarterly cash
dividend.
 
Any future capital raises may dilute
stockholders’ ownership, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 
The Company is not
restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that
represent the right to receive, common stock. The market price of the Company’s common stock could decline as a result of
sales of shares of our common stock at a price below the current market value. Because the Company’s decision to issue securities
in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, the Company cannot predict or estimate
the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, the Company’s stockholders bear the risk of any future offerings
reducing the market price of their common stock and diluting their stock holdings in the Company’s common stock.

Corporation’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ACFC.” As of March 12, 2012,
there were 2,629,061 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, with approximately 1,900 stockholders of record, including
approximately 1,350 beneficial owners and other persons or entities holding stock in nominee or “street name” accounts
with brokers.
 
The Company began paying
quarterly dividends in May 2005 using earnings from investments and un-invested proceeds received from the minority stock offering
completed on October 4, 2004. On September 25, 2009, the Company announced that it had suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend.
Future dividend payments by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation will be primarily dependent on dividends it receives from its
subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Bank. Under OCC regulations, the dollar amount of dividends Atlantic Coast Bank may pay is dependent
upon its capital position and recent earnings. Under normal circumstances, if Atlantic Coast Bank satisfies its capital requirements
it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed in the OCC regulations. However, under the Supervisory Agreement entered
into by the Company on December 10, 2010, dividends or other capital distributions cannot be declared or paid prior to receiving
a written non-objection from the Federal Reserve. The Supervisory Agreement also requires the Bank obtain approval of the OCC 30
days prior to declaring a dividend payment or distribution of capital. It is unlikely the Company will be able to pay dividends
to stockholders in the near future.
 
The following table
sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices and dividends declared on, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s common
stock (prior to February 3, 2011, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s common stock) for the two years ended December 31,
2011 and 2010. All stock prices have been adjusted to reflect the 0.1960 exchange ratio as a result of the completion of the second
step conversion.

Item
7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
General
 
The
Bank’s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans
secured by various types of collateral, including real estate and other consumer assets. The Bank is significantly affected by
prevailing economic conditions, particularly interest rates, as well as government policies and regulations concerning among other
things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Attracting and maintaining deposits is influenced by a
number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non-financial institutions,
account maturities, fee structures, and level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are affected by the demand for
funds and thus are influenced by interest rates, the number and quality of lenders and regional economic growth. Sources of funds
for lending activities of the Bank include deposits, borrowings, payments on loans, maturities of securities and income provided
from operations. 
 
Earnings
are primarily dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and interest expense and the
provision for loan losses. Interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period
and the yield earned on such loans and investments. Interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding
during the same period and interest rates paid on such deposits and borrowings. Provision for loan losses results from actual incurred
losses when loans are charged-off and the collateral is insufficient to recover unpaid amounts, as well as an allowance for estimated
future losses from uncollected loans. Earnings are also affected by the Bank’s service charges, gains and losses from sales
of loans and securities, commission income, interchange fees, other income, non-interest expenses and income taxes. Non-interest
expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing costs, FDIC insurance premiums,
outside professional services, interchange fees, collection expenses and cost of repossessed assets, and other expenses. Earnings
may also be negatively impacted by the Supervisory Agreements entered into by the Company and the Bank with the Office of Thrift
Supervision (predecessor regulatory agency to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve). Please see
“Supervision and Regulation – Regulatory Agreements with the Office of Thrift Supervision” and “Risk Factors”
for more information.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Certain accounting
policies are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, since they require management to make difficult,
complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these
policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, but without limitation,
changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations. Management believes
that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, determining other-than-temporary impairment
of securities, other real estate owned and accounting for deferred income taxes. Accounting
policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. 
 

66
 

 
Allowance
for Loan Losses
 
An
allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The
allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses
are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Generally, loan losses are charged against the allowance
when management believes the uncollectibity of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the
allowance. Due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weak United States economy in general, it is increasingly
likely that impairment reserves on non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity loans, will not be recoverable
and represent a confirmed loss. As a consequence the Company recognizes the charge-off of impairment reserves on non-performing
one-to-four family residential and home equity loans in the period the loan is classified as such. This process accelerates the
recognition of charge-offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process.
 
The
reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management, within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory
guidelines, based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting the Bank’s key lending
areas. Senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the
Bank’s senior management and Board of Directors.
 
Management’s
methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include a general loss component
by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans. The allowance also incorporates the results of measuring
impaired loans.
 
The
general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation
of the loans or pools of loans. Changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non-performing loans affect the
amount of this component. Loss factors are based on the Bank’s recent loss experience, current market conditions that may
impact real estate values within the Bank’s primary lending areas, and on other significant factors that, in management’s
judgment, may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Other significant factors that exist
as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends
(including trends in non-performing loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, geographic foreclosure
rates, new and existing home inventories, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments
and recent charge-off experience in particular segments of the portfolio. The impact of the general loss component on the allowance
began increasing during 2008 and has continued to increase during each year through 2011. The increase reflected the deterioration
of market conditions, and the increase in the recent loan loss experience that has resulted from management’s proactive approach
to charging off losses on impaired loans in the period the impairment is identified.
 
Management
also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive
on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. For all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that
the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement, impairment is determined by computing
a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan’s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral
if the loan is collateral dependent. No specific allowance is recorded unless fair value is less than carrying value. Large groups
of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment
and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation; for these loans, the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance
with the general allowance for loan losses policy described above. Accordingly, individual consumer and residential loans are not
separately identified for impairment disclosures.
 

67
 

 
Loans for which
the terms have been modified as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings
("TDRs"). TDRs are measured for impairment based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using the
loan’s  interest rate at inception of the loan or the appraised value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. Impairment of homogenous loans, such as one-to four-residential loans, that have been modified as TDRs is
calculated in the aggregate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Loans modified as TDRs with market
rates of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for 12 months
in accordance with the modified terms. The assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous TDR loans is done based on
the weighted average rates of those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure.
 
The allowance for loan
losses was $15.5 million at December 31, 2011, and $13.3 million at December 31, 2010. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage
of total loans was 2.98% at December 31, 2011, and 2.37% as of December 31, 2010. The provision for loan losses for each quarter
of 2011 and 2010, and the total for the respective years is as follows:
 


  
2011  
2010 

  
(In Millions) 

First quarter 
$2.8  
$3.7 

Second quarter

 7.5 

Third quarter 
 4.4  
 3.1 

Fourth quarter 
 5.2  
 6.9 

Total 
$15.4  
$21.2 

 
This data demonstrates
the manner in which the allowance for loan losses and related provision expense can change over long-term and short-term periods.
Changes in economic conditions, the nature and size of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact
the required level of allowance for loan losses, particularly for larger individually evaluated loan relationships, in relatively
short periods of time. The allowance for loan losses allocated to individually evaluated loan relationships was $6.0 million at
December 31, 2011 and $3.9 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $2.0 million. Given the rapidly changing and uncertain
real estate market coupled with changes in borrowers’ financial condition, weakening of collateral values, and the overall
economic conditions, management anticipates there will continue to be significant changes in individual specific loss allocations
in future periods as these factors are difficult to predict and can vary widely as more information becomes available or as projected
events change.

Fair Value of Securities
Available for Sale
 
Securities available
for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in other comprehensive income
(loss), net of tax. The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices,
if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices
of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair
values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). 
 
Management evaluates
securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic
or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the
length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects
of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Company has
the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated
recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment
and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.
 
When OTTI is determined
to have occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or
it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis,
less any current-period credit loss. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be
required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI recognized
in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If
the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security
before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI is separated into the amount representing the
credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total related to the credit loss is determined based
on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the OTTI related
to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the
OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. The Company recorded an OTTI charge of $186,000
for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Other Real Estate Owned
 
Assets acquired through
or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the date of foreclosure,
establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense.
Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to the holding of property are expensed.

Deferred Income Taxes
 
After converting to
a federally chartered savings bank, Atlantic Coast Bank became a taxable organization. Income tax expense (benefit) is the total
of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets
and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates and operating loss carryforwards. The Company’s principal deferred tax
assets result from the allowance for loan losses and operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation
with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become
a taxable organization. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation records income tax expense based upon management’s interpretation
of the applicable tax regulations. Positions taken by the Company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to
the review of taxing authorities, and the review by taxing authorities of the positions taken by management could result in a
material adjustment to the financial statements.
 
All
available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered when determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary
to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset to a balance that is considered more likely than not to be realized. The
determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management’s
evaluation of such evidence. Positive evidence considered includes the probability of achieving forecasted taxable income and the
ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition. Negative evidence includes the Company’s
cumulative losses. Following the initial establishment of a valuation allowance in 2009, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient
pre-tax income in future periods or otherwise fails to meet forecasted operating results, an additional valuation allowance may
be required, offsetting the tax benefit for operating losses that would otherwise be recognized. Any valuation allowance is required
to be recorded during the period identified. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a valuation allowance of $25.6 million, or
100% of the net deferred tax asset.
 
Business Strategy
 

Overview.
Our primary objective is to operate in our primary market areas as a retail community-oriented financial institution, serving
customers following a traditional retail banking model while providing stockholders a solid long-term return on capital.
Accomplishing this objective will require financial strength based on a strong capital position, and the implementation of
business strategies designed to return the Company to profitability consistent with safety and soundness considerations. To
strengthen the Company’s capital position the Company is exploring all strategic alternatives to raise capital.
Operating strategies are focused on credit management and reducing the cost of non-performing assets, increasing revenues
from mortgage warehouse lending and small business lending activities that maximize profits but with lower
capital requirements, while reducing our expense base. In addition, a key element of the Company retail focus is to increase
non-maturity deposits which leads to deeper customer relationships and improve our cost of funds. The following are the key
elements of our business strategy:

and the Company's recent operating results, the Company's Board of Directors began a review of strategic alternatives late in 2011,
engaging Stifel, Nicolaus Weisel, Incorporated to assist the Board in exploring alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including
consideration of a potential business combination in addition to a previously disclosed rights offering. As part of its review
of strategic alternatives, the Company requested and has received approval from its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, to
pursue strategic alternatives that may lead to a transaction that requires stockholder approval. There can be no assurances that
the Company will complete a business combination or raise additional capital. The Board of Directors is reviewing all possible
strategic alternatives and the relative benefits of such alternatives to stockholders.
 
Continuing our
proactive approach to reducing non-performing assets by aggressive resolution and disposition initiatives. As a result
of the decline in our local economy beginning in 2008, the Bank experienced a substantial increase in our non-performing assets.
At December 31, 2011, our non-performing assets were $49.6 million as compared to $9.6 million at December 31, 2007. Management
has instituted a proactive strategy to aggressively reduce non-performing assets through accelerated charge-offs, loan work out
programs, enhanced collection practices, the use of distressed asset sales and improved risk management.
 

·An aggressive charge-off policy.
Beginning in 2009, management began to implement an aggressive charge-off strategy for one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans and home equity loans by taking partial or full charge-offs in the period that such loans became non-accruing, generally
when loans are 90 days or more past due.
 

·Loan work out programs. We
remain committed to working with responsible borrowers to renegotiate residential loan terms. The Bank had $19.3 million in troubled
debt restructurings at December 31, 2011, compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2008. Troubled debt restructurings avoid the
expense of foreclosure proceedings and holding and disposition expenses of selling foreclosed property, and provide us increased
interest income. 
 

·Enhanced collection practices.
Beginning in 2009, due to the elevated delinquency of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and the increasing complexity
of working out these types of loans, management engaged the services of a national third party servicer for certain loans. Initially,
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and any associated home equity loan that was 60 days past due, was assigned to the
third party servicer for collection. Subsequently, the Bank assigned other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans to the
third party servicer irrespective of delinquency status, if it was determined the loan may have higher than normal collection risk.
At December 31, 2011, the outstanding balance of loans assigned to the third party servicer was $74.3 million. 
 

·Non-performing asset sales. In
order to reduce the expenses of the foreclosure process, including the sale of foreclosed property, the Bank has sold certain non-performing
loans through national loan sales of distressed assets, which may mitigate future losses. From 2008 to December 31, 2011, the Bank
sold $10.2 million of loans through distressed asset sales resulting in a loss on such sales of $4.1 million. The Bank may continue
distressed asset sales in the future to dispose of non-performing assets when management believes it will result in the least overall
loss to the Company. The Bank also has accepted short sales of residential property by borrowers where such properties are sold
at a loss and the proceeds of such sales are paid to us.  
   


71
 

 

·Credit risk management. The
Bank is also enhancing credit administration by improving internal risk management processes. In 2010, an independent risk committee
of our board of directors was established to evaluate and monitor system, market and credit risk. 
 
Increasing revenue
by expanding our warehouse lending operations and an increasing emphasis on commercial lending to small businesses. Historically,
Atlantic Coast Bank has emphasized the origination of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in northeastern Florida and
southeastern Georgia. At December 31, 2011, our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio was $241.5 million, or 46.9%, of
our loan portfolio. During late 2008, the Bank began to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market on a limited
scale. As a result of our internal evaluation, management intends to shift our business model to sell mortgage loans originated
by our internal sales force and sell mortgages purchased through warehouse lending arrangements. In addition, the Bank intends
to increase production in its small business lending initiative.
 

·Warehouse lending strategy. In
the latter part of 2009, the Bank began a program for warehouse lending where we finance mortgages originated by third parties
and hold a lien position for a short duration (usually less than 30 days) while earning interest (and often a fee) until a sale
is completed to an investor. Management expects to modestly expand this aspect of mortgage banking in the future. 
 

·Commercial lending strategy. Management
also plans to increase commercial business lending and owner-occupied commercial real estate lending with an emphasis on small
businesses, subject to regulatory capital requirements. The Bank intends to participate in government programs relating to commercial
business loans such as the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA").
The Bank began to implement this strategy in September 2010, by hiring an executive to lead the small business lending along with
an experienced SBA lending team. As of December 31, 2011 the SBA loan pipeline grew from $3.9 million at the beginning of the year
to $14.5 million at December 31, 2011. The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of SBA loans to investors at attractive
premiums. Our focus on owner-occupied commercial real estate loans will be to professional service businesses. The Bank intends
to target principal balances of up to $1.5 million in our commercial business and owner-occupied commercial real estate lending,
while not originating or purchasing higher risk loans such as commercial real estate development projects, multi-family loans and
land acquisition and development loans. 
 
Expanding
our retail franchise by growing our non-maturity deposit. We believe a strong core or non-maturity deposit base is
key to a retail community bank's success because customer relationships are deepened. Therefore we remain committed to
generating lower-cost and more stable non-maturity deposits in our market. The Bank attracts and retains transaction accounts
by offering competitive products and rates, excellent customer service and a comprehensive marketing program. Our deposit
marketing  programs are focused on individuals, businesses and municipalities located in our market area.  Our
non-maturity deposits (consisting of demand, savings and money market accounts) increased $21.3 million to $310.7 million at
December 31, 2011 from $289.4 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, non-maturity deposits comprised 61.1% of
our total deposits, compared to 54.8% of our total deposits at December 31, 2010. Non-maturity deposits are our least costly
source of funds, which improves our interest rate spread and also contributes non-interest income from account related
services.
 

Reducing our operating
expense base. The Company has historically operated with a high cost structure as it has implemented growth and new business
activities. In order to improve profitability we are focused on reducing operating costs which do not add value to our other business
strategies by implementing a review of all major vendors and operating processes. These actions are expected to reduce the run
rate of operating expenses, before credit costs, by approximately $3 million in 2012

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2011
and December 31, 2010
 
General.
In order to maintain its well capitalized status, the Company strategically reduced its assets during 2011. Total assets decreased
$38.4 million to $789.0 million at December 31, 2011 as compared to $827.4 million at December 31, 2010. Specifically net
portfolio loans decreased by $44.0 million, investments in available-for-sale securities decreased by $22.3 million, bank owned
life insurance decreased by $8.3 million and other real estate owned decreased by $4.1 million. These reductions were partially
offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $32.5 million and loans held for sale of $12.3 million. Non-maturity deposits
(consisting of demand, savings and money market accounts) grew by a combined $21.3 million, while time deposits decreased by $41.4
million and Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by $15.0 million.

Cash and cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were comprised of cash-on-hand and interest earning and non-interest earning balances
held in other depository institutions. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents were greater as compared to December 31,
2010 due to the decline in loans, net and securities available for sale, which increased our liquidity. However, during much of
2011, cash and cash equivalents were lower as compared to previous years due to the decline in total deposits, primarily time deposits.
As opportunities became available excess cash was invested in short-term cash management accounts at other banks until more permanent
and higher yielding assets are identified. Management expects the balances in cash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate
as other interest earning assets mature, but generally be held at balances necessary to meet liquidity requirements while excess
amounts are deployed to higher yielding assets. The Company believes it has sufficient contingent liquidity sources to meet liquidity
demands.
 

73
 

 
Securities available
for sale. Securities available for sale was comprised primarily of debt securities of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises,
and mortgage-backed securities. The investment portfolio decreased approximately $22.3 million to $126.8 million at December 31,
2011, net of purchases, sales and maturities, as these proceeds were primarily re-invested in loans held for sale. Included in
this decrease was the disposal of private label collateralized mortgage obligations which totaled $6.7 million at the end of 2010.
In order to eliminate the risk of additional other-than-temporary impairment charges, the Company sold the four remaining private
label securities totaling $1.4 million at a loss of $189,000 during 2011 and accordingly had no private label securities at December
31, 2011. Expense for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of $186,000 was recorded in non-interest income for the year ended
December 31, 2011.
 
At December 31, 2011,
approximately $125.9 million, or 99% of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities
and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to
support. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011 as the unrealized
losses were attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and the Company does not have the
intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.
 
Approximately $122.2
million of the Company’s available-for-sale securities were collateral for structured transactions totaling $92.8 million
that were entered into during 2006 and 2007 under agreements to repurchase (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Securities sold under agreements to repurchase”). These transactions
were entered into by the Company to take advantage of favorable interest rate spreads and to reduce overall exposure to interest
rate risk in 2006 and 2007. As a result of the unprecedented decline in interest rates beginning in 2008, as well as illiquidity
in the mortgage-backed securities market, coupled with the overall decline in the Bank’s credit quality, the Bank has been
subject to additional collateral requirements by the third party counterparties to the repurchase agreements. Additionally, given
the collateral requirements of these transactions, the current interest rate environment and the illiquidity in the marketplace,
the available for sale securities portfolio is currently a limited source of liquidity.
 
Loans held for
sale. Loans held for sale were comprised entirely of loans secured by one-to-four family residential homes originated internally
or purchased from third-party originators as part of our warehouse lending program. As of December 31, 2011, the weighted average
number of days outstanding of real estate mortgages held for sale was 20 days.
 
	During the year
ended December 31, 2011 the Company originated a total of $741.1 million of loans held for sale, comprised of approximately $97.6
million of loans originated internally, and approximately $643.5 million of loans purchased from third parties under warehouse
loan agreements. Approximately $726.2 million of the loans were sold, resulting in a gain of $1.8 million and interest earned of
approximately $1.9 million or 5.26% on outstanding balances was recorded in interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2010
gains on sales and interest earned was $1.0 million and $993,000, respectively. The Company intends to continue to focus on opportunities
to grow this line of business in the near future due to its favorable margins and efficient capital management.

Gross portfolio loans
declined approximately 7.4% to $514.6 million at December 31, 2011 as compared to $555.8 million at December 31, 2010, due primarily
to principal amortization and increased payoffs of one-to-four family residential loans due to historically low interest rates.
SBA loans as of December 31, 2011 which are included in commercial real estate, commercial construction and commercial loans, were
$6.8 million as compared to $350,000 at December 31, 2010. The balance of SBA loans at year end 2011 includes approximately $14.6
million of non-guaranteed originated loan balances. Total portfolio loan originations decreased $23.4 million to $39.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to lessened loan demand.
 
Until critical economic
factors such as unemployment and residential real estate values stabilize and the Bank increases its capital levels, management
believes portfolio loan balances will continue to decline. Principal amortization and loan payoffs are expected to exceed growth
in the SBA portfolio and other small business lending production. For a discussion regarding the effects of the decline in property
values on the Bank’s one-to-four family residential loan portfolio, see “Item 1 – Business Lending Activities
– One-to-four family real estate portfolio lending.” However, due to a favorable interest rate environment, production
of one-to-four family loans held for sale in the secondary market is expected to continue its moderate pace. The strategy of selling
the majority of originated loans in the secondary market also compliments the Bank’s desire to reduce portfolio loan balances
in order to maximize capital efficiently.
 

75
 

 
The composition of
the Bank’s loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward one-to-four family residential loans. As of December 31, 2011, first
mortgages (including residential construction loans), second mortgages and home equity loans totaled $317.7 million, or 61.7% of
total gross loans. Approximately $43.7 million, or 59.9% of loans recorded as home equity loans are in a first lien position. Accordingly,
$287.2 million, or 91.3% of loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential loans were in a first lien position as of December
31, 2011.

During the year ended
December 31, 2011, loan charge-offs included approximately $6.1 million of partial charge-offs of one-to-four family residential
and home equity loans identified as non-performing. Due to the decline in real estate values over the past two years, management
believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance of loans collateralized by non-performing one-to-four family
residential property by the expected loss amount which is both probable and reasonable to estimate, rather than providing a general
allowance. The $8.5 million decline in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due
to a $2.8 million loss on a distressed asset sale of $6.3 million of non-performing residential loans and a $3.3 million charge-off
on one commercial construction real estate loan, both of which occurred in 2010.
 
The decrease in the
provision for loan losses of $5.8 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to lower charge-offs on one-to-four family
and commercial construction loans, partially offset by higher charge-offs on home equity loans.
 
Non-Performing
Assets. The following table shows non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2011

Non-performing loans
were $46.6 million, or 8.94% of total loans, at December 31, 2011, and $28.1 million, or 4.99% of total loans at December 31,
2010. The increase in non-performing loans was due to an increase of $5.9 million in non-performing residential one-to-four family
loans partially due to the extended foreclosure process in Florida and an increase of $7.0 million in non-performing commercial
real estate loans. The increase in non-performing commercial real estate loans was primarily due to two income producing properties
which had been restructured and previously classified as performing, but began to demonstrate some weakness, prompting management
to classify them as non-performing. The $1.4 million increase in non-performing commercial business and other real estate loans
was comprised of one undeveloped land loan and one multi-family condominium loan. The $1.7 million increase in non-performing home
equity loans was primarily due to two first lien position home equity loans which are in the process of foreclosure. The $1.5 million
increase in non-performing other commercial loans was comprised primarily of three loans: two commercial lines of credit of $500,000
each and one commercial business loan of approximately $200,000.
 
As of December 31,
2011, total non-performing one-to-four family residential and home equity loans of $20.2 million included $17.4 million of one-to-four
family residential loans that had been written-down to the estimated fair value of their collateral. Further declines in the fair
value of the collateral, or a decision to sell loans as distressed assets, could result in additional losses. As of December 31,
2011, and December 31, 2010, all non-performing loans were classified as non-performing, and there were no loans 90 days past due
and accruing interest as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
Other real estate owned
declined $4.1 million primarily due to greater sales of foreclosed assets.

The allowance for loan
losses allocated for one-to-four family residential and home equity loans as of December 31, 2011 included a provision of $2.7
million as a result of the Company’s review of the effect of the slowdown in the foreclosure process in Florida and the estimated
impact on collateral valuations of one-to-four family residential portfolio. The allowance for loan losses allocated to consumer
loans decreased $1.1 million primarily due to the decrease in allowance required for mobile home loans. In 2009 the Bank assumed
full liability for mobile home loans purchased from a broker based on a settlement of deposits maintained at the Bank for loan
losses. Initially the allowance estimated for these loans was 2.0% of outstanding balances. Based on historical losses and other
factors this reserve is now maintained at 1.03% of outstanding balance. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had no loans delinquent
90 days or more that were accruing interest. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, loans 90 days or more past due and non-performing loans
as a percentage of total loans were 8.94% and 4.99% of total assets, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, contractual
gross interest income of $3.0 million would have been recorded on non-performing loans if those loans had been current. Interest
in the amount of $542,000 was included in income during 2011 on such loans.

Impaired
loans include large non-homogenous loans where it is probable that the Bank will not receive all principal and interest when
contractually due. Impaired loans also include troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) where the borrower has
performed for less than 12 months under the terms of the modification and / or the TDR loan is at less than market rate at
the time of restructure. The assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous TDR loans is done based on the weighted
average rates of those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure. When a TDR loan with a market
rate of interest has performed for over 12 months under terms of the modification it is classified as a performing
loan.
 
Non-performing
impaired loans increased $11.1 million primarily due to six commercial loans, five of which had been restructured during 2010,
which moved to non-performing status during 2011.
 
Performing TDRs
 decreased primarily due to the reclassification of one commercial real estate loan of $2.0 million to
non-performing when the borrower failed to perform, and the reclassification of residential loans to performing status
following 12 months of performance under terms of the modification.
 
Non-performing
loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $14.9 million and $828,000, respectively, were previously modified as TDRs but
failed to perform under the terms of the modification.
 
TDRs
decreased $3.2 million at year end 2011, as compared to the year-end 2010. At December 31, 2011, approximately $10.0 million or
43% of the TDRs were one-to-four family loans of which approximately $1.0 million were not performing according to the restructured
terms. Impairment due to modification in troubled debt restructurings of non-performing loans, such as one-to-four family residential
loans is included in general reserve. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 this reserve was $924,000 and $636,000, respectively.
 
Deferred
Income Taxes. As of both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bank concluded that, while improved operating results are expected
as the economy begins to improve which would reduce our non-performing assets, the variability of the credit related costs are
such that a more likely than not conclusion of realization of our deferred tax asset could not be supported. Consequently, management
recorded a valuation allowance of $25.6 million for the full amount of the net federal and state deferred tax assets as of December
31, 2011. Until such time as the determination is made it is more likely than not that the Company is able to generate taxable
income, no tax benefits will be recorded in future periods to reduce net losses before taxes. However, at such time in the future
that we record taxable income or determine that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not, some or all of
the valuation allowance may be available as a tax benefit.

Deposits.
Total deposit account balances were $508.4 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $20.1 million from $528.5
million at December 31, 2010. Time deposits decreased $41.4 million but non-maturity deposits increased $21.3 million as consumers
demonstrated a preference for shorter duration, more liquid deposit products rather than re-investing in time deposits due to
the low interest rate environment. The increase in non-maturity deposits occurred as depositors increased their savings and money
market accounts by $17.5 million and also increased their interest bearing demand accounts by $5.1 million between December 31,
2010 and 2011. Management believes near term deposit growth will be moderate with an emphasis on non-maturity deposits to match
asset growth expectations. Dramatic changes in the short-term interest rate environment could affect the availability of deposits
in our local market however and therefore cause the Bank to promote time deposit growth in order to meet liquidity needs. Under
Atlantic Coast Bank’s Supervisory Agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision dated December 14, 2010, the Bank may
not increase brokered deposits without prior written approval. According to the terms of the agreement the Bank could not have
more than $52.5 million of brokered deposits outstanding. At December 31, 2011 the Bank had brokered deposits of $22.4 million.
The Company’s management does not believe the restriction has a significant effect on the Company’s liquidity. For
additional information on the Supervisory Agreement between Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank with
the Office of Thrift Supervision see “Item 1 - Business – How We Are Regulated – Supervisory Agreement”.
 
Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase. The Bank has $92.8 million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase
(“reverse repo”) comprised of structured notes with two different counterparties in amounts totaling $77.8 million
and $15.0 million, respectively. The individual agreements take the form of term repurchase agreements with maturities beginning
in 2014 and final maturities in 2018. The fair value of the securities collateralizing the reverse repos at December 31, 2011
was $122.1 million. The market value of the debt and certain other collateral requirements exceeded the principal balance outstanding
by $15.3 million.
 
The
agreements with the counterparty of the $77.8 million reverse repo contain default conditions which if triggered would materially
impact the Bank’s capital and results of operations. In the event the Bank becomes less than adequately capitalized or receives
a cease and desist order from the OCC the counterparty has the option to terminate the reverse repo agreements at the market rate
of the debt. As of December 31, 2011 the market rate of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by $12.5 million.

Federal
Home Loan Bank advances. FHLB advances of $135.0 million had a weighted-average maturity of 55 months and a weighted-average
rate of 3.88% at December 31, 2011. The $15.0 million decrease in FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2011 as compared to December 31,
2010 was due to repayments of $181.0 million offset by additional borrowings of $166.0 million. The Company expects to continue
to utilize FHLB advances to manage both short- and long-term liquidity needs to the extent it has borrowing capacity, needs funding
and the interest expense of FHLB advances is attractive compared to deposits and other alternative sources of funds.
 
Other
borrowings. Other borrowings were $0 and $5.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company borrowed
$5.0 million, at a market rate, from another financial institution in June 2010 secured by shares of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s
common stock owned by Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC. The Company’s Chairman of the Board also serves as the president and
chief executive officer and a director of the financial institution from which the borrowing was obtained. The Company repaid
the $5.0 million loan with proceeds from the second step conversion and offering in February 2011.

Stockholders’
Equity
 
Stockholders’
equity increased by approximately $1.5 million to $46.3 million at December 31, 2011 from $44.8 million at December 31, 2010 due
to the completion of the second step conversion and offering, which was nearly offset by the net loss of $10.3 million for the
year ended December 30, 2011 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.8 million.
 
On
February 3, 2011, the second step conversion of Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC into the stock holding company structure and related
stock offering of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation was completed. Net proceeds of $14.4 million were raised in the stock offering,
which included $684,000 loaned by the Company to a trust for the ESOP enabling it to purchase 68,434 shares of common stock in
the stock offering for allocation under such plan. $5.0 million of the proceeds was also used to repay the other borrowings described
above.
 
During
2009 and 2010, the Company implemented strategies to preserve capital including the suspension of cash dividends and its stock
repurchase program. Resumption of these programs is not expected to occur in the near term. The Company’s equity
to assets ratio increased to 5.87% at December 31, 2011, from 5.41% at December 31, 2010. Atlantic Coast Bank continued to be
in excess of all minimum regulatory capital requirements, and is considered “well capitalized” under those formulas.
However, as of December 31, 2011, the Bank was not in compliance with the Individual Minimum Capital Requirement (IMCR) agreed
to by the Bank with the Office of Thrift Supervision on May 13, 2011. Under the IMCR, the Bank agreed to achieve a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of 7.0% as of September 30, 2011, and maintain such ratio for future quarters. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted
assets was 10.9%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 9.7%, and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (Tier 1 leverage
ratio) was 5.8% at December 31, 2011, respectively. These ratios as of December 31, 2010 were 10.1%, 8.8% and 5.5%, respectively.
 
Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
General.
The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $10.3 million, as compared to a net loss of $14.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decreased net loss of $3.9 million was primarily due to the $5.8 million
decrease in our provision for loan losses as a result of lower net charge-offs. The provision for loan losses was $15.4 million
in 2011, a decrease of 27.5% from $21.2 million in 2010. Net interest income decreased 9.0%, or $2.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011 to $21.5 million, as compared to 2010, due to the decrease in average balances of interest-earning assets as
a result of the Company’s capital preservation plan, as well as a decrease in average yield of interest-earning assets.
Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 35.9% to $11.2 million, as compared to $8.3 million in 2010,
due primarily to higher gains on sales of available-for-sale securities and loans as well as lower other-than-temporary impairment
charges on available-for-sale securities. Non-interest expense increased 12.8% to $28.1 million in 2011 from $24.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to increased expenses associated with our mortgage banking and small business lending
platforms.

Rate/Volume
Analysis. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major
components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010.
For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable
to: (1) changes in volume multiplied by the old rate; (2) changes in rate, which are changes in rate multiplied by the old volume;
and (3) changes not solely attributable to rate or volume have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and
the change due to rate.

Interest
income. Interest income decreased to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $44.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010. As shown in the table above the decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011,
as compared to 2010, was primarily due to both a decrease in average balances of interest-earning assets of $139.9 million as
well as a decrease in average yield of 27 basis points. The decline in interest income earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher
rate one-to-four family residential loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates. Proceeds from payoffs on one-to-four
family loans were primarily re-invested in loans held for sale, which yielded approximately 5.26% during the year ended December
31, 2011. The decrease in average outstanding balances of one-to-four family real estate loans for the year ended December 31,
2011, as compared to 2010, accounted for substantially all of the total $40.0 million decrease in average loan balances.
 
Interest
income in 2011 from securities decreased by approximately $2.8 million due to a $47.0 million decline in average balances, as
well as a 69 basis point decrease in average yields on purchases of new securities.
 
Our
interest income could continue to decrease in the near-term due to continued low interest rates and limited loan growth.

Interest
expense. Interest expense decreased to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $21.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily
due to the lower average balances of interest-bearing liabilities which decreased by $91.4 million as well as lower interest rates
paid on average outstanding balances of deposit accounts. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board maintained
the target rate for Federal Funds borrowings at 0.25%. In general, this has led to rate decreases on interest-bearing deposit
accounts in the Bank’s markets, even as competition for deposits among financial institutions intensified. During 2011 the
Company decreased interest rates on its money-market accounts, interest bearing demand accounts and time deposits. The average
cost on interest-bearing liabilities declined 28 basis points to 2.36% in 2011 from 2.64% in 2010.
 
The
Bank has $227.8 million in long-term borrowings with the earliest maturities beginning in 2013 and final maturities occurring
in 2018. The weighted average rate of the long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 was 4.32%, and accounted for approximately
62% of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011. Given the announced intentions of the Federal Reserve Bank to hold
interest rates at their current levels until 2014, the long term borrowings are expected to have a negative impact to our net
interest margin.
 
Net
interest income. Net interest income decreased to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $23.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the decrease in interest expense. Net interest spread, which is the difference
between the interest yield earned on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, increased
1 basis point to 2.67% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2.66% for 2010. For the same comparative periods, net
interest margin, which is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets increased 4 basis points
to 2.83% in 2011 from 2.79% for 2010. Management expects the interest rate environment to remain at its present level for the
next 12 - 18 months, resulting in lower yields earned on interest-earning assets. However, future reduction in deposit costs are
likely to be less and therefore, considering the fixed rate cost of the borrowings, net interest income is expected to continue
to decrease in 2012.
 
Provision
for loan losses. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan
losses as necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses based on all known and inherent losses that are both probable
and can be reasonably estimated. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans future loan loss provisions
may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and changes in borrower situations. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require
additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.
 
Provisions
for loan losses of $15.4 million and $21.2 million were made during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The decrease in provision for loan losses in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to lower charge-offs on one-to-four family
residential and commercial construction loans, partially offset by increased provision for increasing non-performing loans.

Non-interest
income for the year ended December 30, 2011, increased $3.0 million to $11.2 million from $8.3 million for 2010. The increase
of $1.7 million in gain on sale of available-for-sale securities was primarily due to higher sales volume, as the Company took
advantage of declining long-term interest rates in the third quarter of 2011 and sold mortgage-backed securities in advance of
anticipated prepayment acceleration, resulting in a gain of $3.2 million. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment
(OTTI) charges of $186,000 during 2011 as compared to $423,000 during 2010, resulting in an improvement of approximately $237,000.
 
The
increased gain on sales of loans held for sale of $803,000 was primarily the result of the expansion of our small business lending
operations which accounted for $532,000, or approximately 66% of the increased gain on sale of loans. The Company recorded gains
of $1.8 million on loan sales of $726.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $981,000 on loan sales of
$402.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
 
Interchange
fees increased as a result of higher volume associated with our interest-bearing rewards checking program.
 
Services
charges and fees, which are earned primarily based on transaction services for deposit account customers, decreased as a result
of decreased activity resulting in lower ATM and check card overdraft fees.

Non-interest
expense increased $3.2 million to $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $24.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010. Components of the increase included higher compensation and benefits expense, increased expenses of loan collections
and higher outside professional services expense. The year ended December 31, 2011, included higher compensation expenses related
to the expansion of our mortgage banking and small business lending groups of $1.8 million. Included in compensation and benefit
expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a non-recurring expense of approximately $800,000 for the partial restoration
of certain supplemental executive retirement plans (SERP) that partially vested as a result of the completion of the second step
conversion in the first quarter of 2011. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $1.2 million excluding the increases related
to mortgage banking, small business lending and the partial SERP vesting. During the second quarter of 2011 the Company reduced
mortgage banking management positions and closed three under-performing mortgage origination offices, the impact of this change
began to be fully realized beginning in the third quarter of 2011.
 
Management
expects non-interest expenses will continue at elevated levels primarily as a result of the expansion of new business initiatives
and the costs associated with increased collection and foreclosure activities as a result of the extended time involved in the
foreclosure process in Florida.
 
Income
tax expense. Income tax (benefit) expense was ($424,000) and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The 2011 income tax benefit was the result of the Company filing an amended income tax return for the 2008 tax year.

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 
 
General.
The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $14.2 million, as compared to a net loss of $29.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decreased net loss was primarily due to the improvement in our net interest
margin which resulted in a $1.9 million increase in net interest income, a $3.6 million decrease in our provision for loan losses,
a decrease in other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) expense for investment securities of $4.0 million. In addition, the results
of operations in 2010 were not affected by one time charges in 2009 consisting of the establishment of a 100% valuation allowance
for federal deferred tax assets, and the loss from impairment of goodwill which collectively decreased our net loss in 2010 as
compared to 2009 by approximately $15.1 million.  Net interest income increased 8.6%, or $1.9 million in the year ended December
31, 2010 to $23.7 million, as compared to 2009, as the decrease in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities more than exceeded
the reduced interest income on interest-earning assets. The provision for loan losses was $21.2 million in 2010, a decrease of
14.6% from $24.9 million in 2009. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 98.2% to $8.3 million,
as compared to $4.2 million in 2009, due primarily to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale securities.
Non-interest expense increased 2.4% to $24.9 million in 2010 from $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Income tax
expense decreased due to a one-time non-cash charge in 2009 to establish a 100% valuation allowance for the Company's deferred
tax asset.

Interest
income. Interest income decreased to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $48.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2009. As shown in the table above the decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010,
as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decrease in average balances of interest-earning assets. The decline of interest income
earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher rate one-to-four family loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates.
The decrease in average outstanding balances of one-to-four family real estate loans for the year ended December 31, 2010, as
compared to 2009, accounted for the majority of the total $74.4 million decrease in average loan balances.
 
Interest
income earned in 2010 from securities decreased by approximately $600,000 due to an 80 basis point decrease in average rates on
new purchases of comparable securities, which was partially offset by higher average outstanding balances as a result of reinvesting
liquidity from loan pay-offs securities.
 

89
 

 
Interest
expense. Interest expense decreased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $26.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily
due to lower interest rates paid on average outstanding balances of deposit accounts and FHLB advances as well as the lower average
balances of these interest-bearing liabilities which decreased by $50.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
Federal Reserve Board maintained the target rate for Federal Funds borrowings at 0.25%. In general, this led to rate decreases
on interest-bearing deposit accounts in the Bank’s markets, even as competition for deposits among financial institutions
intensified. During 2010 the Company decreased interest rates on its money-market accounts, interest bearing demand accounts and
time deposits. The average cost on interest-bearing liabilities declined 52 basis points to 2.64% in 2010 from 3.16% in 2009.
 
Net
interest income. Net interest income increased to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $21.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the decrease in interest expense. Net interest spread, which is the difference
between the interest yield earned on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, increased
52 basis points to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2.14% for 2009. For the same comparative periods,
net interest margin, which is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets increased 42 basis
points to 2.79% in 2010 from 2.37% for 2009.
 
Provision
for loan losses. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan
losses as necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses based on all known and inherent losses that are both probable
and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions based on their judgment of information
available to them at the time of their examination.
 
Provision
for loan losses of $21.2 million and $24.9 million were made during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The decrease in provision for loan losses in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a one-time $2.0 million additional
provision in 2009 resulting from a settlement agreement with an on-going third-party originator whereby the Company assumed responsibility
for credit losses on a pool of loans as well as the $67.2 million decrease in the balance of portfolio loans. For the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, net charge-offs were $21.7 million.
 
Non-interest
income. The components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Non-interest
income for the year ended December 30, 2010, increased $4.1 million to $8.3 million from $4.2 million for 2009. The increase in
gain on sale of available-for-sale securities was primarily due to higher sales volume, as the Company strategically reduced total
assets in order to maintain its well capitalized status. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges of
$423,000 during 2010 as compared to $4.5 million during 2009, resulting in an improvement of approximately $4.0 million. (See
also the Item 7-Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of Financial
Condition at December 31, 2010 and 2009 – Securities Available for Sale). These charges represent credit losses from our
investments in non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, caused by defaults and losses on the underlying mortgages. As of
December 31, 2010 the Bank held approximately $6.7 million of non-agency collateralized mortgages. Due to the weak ongoing economic
conditions there is no assurance that additional losses may not be incurred in the future. The $2.6 million decrease in other
non-interest income was the result of two non-recurring items in 2009, a gain of approximately $700,000 on the sale of the Lake
City branch on December 31, 2009 and approximately $2.0 million resulting from a settlement agreement with an on-going third-party
originator whereby the Company assumed responsibility for credit losses on a pool of loans.
 
The
decrease in loss on sale of loans for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009, results from bulk sales of non-performing
one-to-four family residential loans through a third party national sales advisor. This approach is occasionally used when management
believes it will reduce ongoing collection costs and, ultimately, result in the least cost to the Bank. The Bank incurred losses
of $1.3 million on such sales in 2009.
 
Services
charges and fees, which are earned primarily based on transaction services for deposit account customers, decreased as a result
of decreased activity resulting in lower ATM and check card overdraft fees.

Non-interest
expense increased $600,000 to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $24.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2009. Increased expenses associated with collection expense and repossessed asset losses along with higher data processing
costs were partially offset by lower losses on sales of foreclosed assets and other non-interest expenses. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, non-interest expense included two non-recurring transactions that nearly offset. During the third quarter of
2009, the Company wrote-off the entire amount of goodwill resulting in a loss of $2.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2009,
the Company revised supplemental executive retirement plans resulting in a reversal of $2.7 million of expense.
 
Income
tax expense. Income tax expense decreased to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from a tax expense of $6.1
million for 2009. The establishment of a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $16.2 million during 2009 resulted in a much
higher tax expense than what may be expected based upon our pre-tax loss. The valuation allowance also caused significant distortion
in the effective income tax rate on income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was 0%, compared to
26.3% for 2009.
 
Liquidity
 
Management
maintains a liquidity position it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur
in the normal course of business. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation relies on a number of different sources in order to meet
its potential liquidity demands. The primary sources of funds are increases in borrowings, deposit accounts and cash flows from
loan payments and securities sales. The scheduled amortization of loans and securities as well as proceeds from borrowings, are
predictable sources of funds. In addition held-for-sale loans, principally warehouse loans, repay rapidly with an average duration
of less than 30 days, with repayments generally funding advances. Other funding sources, however, such as inflows from new deposits,
mortgage prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
 

In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has
several contingent liquidity sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of December 31, 2011, and December 31,
2010 the Company had additional borrowing capacity of $63.8 million and $56.4 million, respectively, with the FHLB of Atlanta.
Subsequent to year-end, the Company’s borrowing capacity was reduced by approximately $30.0 million following a FHLB of Atlanta
credit and collateral review. The Company also maintains a secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and at December
31, 2011 and 2010 the borrowing capacity was $48.9 million and $37.1 million, respectively. Unpledged marketable investment securities
were approximately $4.8 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company also utilizes a non-brokered Direct Deposit certificate of
deposit listing to meet funding needs at interest rates equal to or less than local market rates.

Threats to the Bank’s liquidity position include rapid
declines in deposit balances due to market volatility caused by major changes in interest rates or negative public perception about
the Bank, or the financial services industry in general. In addition, the Bank’s agreements for sales of securities under
agreements to repurchase (“reverse repo”) which total $92.8 million have collateral requirements in excess of the debt,
this limiting the amount of investment securities available to meet liquidity needs.
  
During
2011, cash and cash equivalents increased $32.5 million from $8.6 million as of December 31, 2010, to $41.0 million as of December
31, 2011. Cash from investing activities of $65.0 million was more than cash used for operating activities of $5.8 million and
cash used for financing activities of $26.7 million. Primary sources of cash were from proceeds from sales of securities available-for-sale
of $140.4 million, proceeds from maturities and payments of available-for-sale securities of $37.0 million, proceeds from the
sale of stock in the second step conversion and offering of $13.7 million, proceeds from the surrender of BOLI of $9.0 million
and proceeds from the sale of other real estate owned of $5.9 million. Primary uses of cash included purchases of available-for-sale
securities of $155.1 million, net decreases in deposits of $20.1 million and net decreases in FHLB advances of $15.0 million.
(See Capital Resources below.)
 
During
2010, cash and cash equivalents decreased $28.5 million from $37.1 million as of December 31, 2009, to $8.6 million as of December
31, 2010. Cash used for operating activities of $28.6 million, combined with cash used for financing activities of $66.9 million,
was more than cash from investing activities of $66.9 million. Primary sources of cash were from proceeds from maturities and
payments of available-for-sale securities of $84.6 million and proceeds from sales of securities available-for-sale of $50.4 million.
Primary uses of cash included purchases of available-for-sale securities of $104.6 million, net decreases in FHLB advances of
$32.7 million and net decreases in deposits of $26.9 million. (See Capital Resources below.)

Capital
Resources
 
At
December 31, 2011, stockholders’ equity totaled $46.3 million. During 2011 the Company’s Board of Directors declared
no regular quarterly dividends. The decision to pay dividends in the future is dependent on operating results, capital and liquidity
requirements.
 
As
of December 31, 2011 Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation held no treasury stock. The Company suspended its repurchase program
in March 2009. Initiation of future share repurchase programs is dependent on liquidity, opportunities for alternative investments
and capital requirements. Under Federal Reserve regulations, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation cannot repurchase shares for
one year following its second step conversion.
 
Management
monitors the capital levels of Atlantic Coast Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory
guidelines for “well capitalized” institutions. Atlantic Coast Bank is required by the OCC to meet minimum capital
adequacy requirements. Atlantic Coast Bank’s actual and required levels of capital as reported to the OCC at December 31,
2011, were as follows:

As
described in “Item 1A Risk Factors” and “Item 1 Business - Supervision and Regulation”, the Company entered
into a supervisory agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision dated December 10, 2010, and in a separate agreement the OTS
imposed an Individual Minimum Capital Requirement for the Bank of 7% Tier 1 core capital by September 30, 2011. The Bank was not
in compliance with this requirement as of December 31, 2011. The impact of these agreements may have a material effect on the
Company’s liquidity, capital resources or operations.
 
Inflation
 
The
effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions. While management believes that
inflation affects the growth of total assets and our profitability, management believes that it is difficult to assess the overall
impact. Management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of inflationary
changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”) coincides with changes in interest rates. The price of one or more components
of the CPI may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall CPI without having corresponding effect on interest rates
or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us. In years of high inflation and high interest rates, intermediate
and long-term interest rates tend to increase, thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities, mortgage
loans and other long-term fixed rate loans. In addition, higher short-term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase
the cost of funds. In other years, the opposite may occur.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
As
a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as
commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash
requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are
subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. In addition, we enter into commitments to
sell mortgage loans. For additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item
7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
The
Bank is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and FHLB advances,
re-price more rapidly or at different rates than our interest-earning assets. In order to minimize the potential for adverse effects
of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on our results of operations, management has adopted an asset and
liability management policy. The board of directors sets the asset and liability management policy for us, which is implemented
by the Asset/Liability Committee.
 
The
purpose of the Asset/Liability Committee is to communicate, coordinate and control asset/liability management consistent with
our business plan and board approved policies. The Asset/Liability Committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets
and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives
are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk,
and profitability goals.
 
The
Asset/Liability Committee generally meets at least monthly to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate
outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital position, anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities
and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to market value of portfolio equity analysis and income
simulations. The Asset/Liability Committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The Asset/Liability Committee
is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least
quarterly.
 
A
key element of our asset/liability plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or re-pricing mismatch between our
interest-earning assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. Historically, management has sought to reduce exposure to earnings through
the use of adjustable rate loans and through the sale of certain fixed rate loans in the secondary market, and by extending funding
maturities through the use of FHLB advances. 
 

95
 

 
Net
Portfolio Value. Given the current relatively low level of market interest rates, an NPV calculation for an interest rate
decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis
points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in
the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.
 
Net
Interest Income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Bank earns on interest-earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.
In our model, management estimates what net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve-month period using historical
data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates, the current term structure for interest rates, and
current deposit and loan offering rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event
of an instantaneous 100, 200 and 300 basis point increase or a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates.

Certain
shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and
net interest income. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual
yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net portfolio value and net interest income
information presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of
a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly
across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although interest
rate-risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements
are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest
income and will differ from actual results.

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Atlantic
Coast Federal Corporation
 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation and its subsidiary as of December
31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009

 

 
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation:
It should be noted the accompanying consolidated financial statements include Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Bank (or "the Bank") together referred to as ("the Company"). The consolidated
financials also include First Community Financial Services, Inc. ("FCFS"), an inactive wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic
Coast Bank. All significant inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and reporting
policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices
within the financial services industry.
 
On February 3, 2011, the second step conversion
of Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC into a stock holding company structure and related stock offering of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
was completed. As a result of the second step conversion, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation, became
the holding company for the Bank. As part of the second step conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, a Federal corporation,
was merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, with Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation as the surviving entity. In connection
with the conversion, the Company sold 1,710,857 shares of common stock at $10 per share, inclusive of 68,434 shares issued to the
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”). In addition, pursuant to an exchange ratio
of 0.1960, the Company exchanged 4,687,466 shares of common stock held by stockholders of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the
predecessor of the Company, for 918,324 shares of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation common stock, net of fractional shares.
As a result of the stock sale and exchange the Company had 2,629,181 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of February
3, 2011. The reorganization was accounted for as a change in corporate form with no resulting change in the historical basis of
the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity. Direct offering costs totaling $2.7 million were deducted from the proceeds
of the shares sold in the offering. Net proceeds of $14.4 million were raised in the stock offering, which included $684,000 loaned
by the Company to a trust for the ESOP enabling it to purchase 68,434 shares of common stock in the stock offering for allocation
under such plan. Average shares and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 have been restated to reflect
the second step conversion and offering completed February 3, 2011. Financial information presented in this report is derived
in part from the consolidated financial statements of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation prior to February 3, 2011.
 
Nature of Operations: Atlantic Coast
Bank provides a broad range of banking services to individual and business customers primarily in northeastern Florida and southeastern
Georgia. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and certificates of deposit, and its primary lending products are
residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans, and commercial loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific
items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are
generally expected to be repaid from the cash flows from the operations of the business. There are no significant concentrations
of loans to any one industry or customer. However, the customers' ability to repay their loans is dependent on the real estate
and general economic conditions in the area.

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 
Stock Repurchase Program: The Company
suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2009.
 
Use of Estimates: To prepare financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates
and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses, realization
of deferred tax assets, valuation of intangible assets including goodwill and the fair values of securities and other financial
instruments are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes
of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents is defined to include cash on hand, deposits with other financial institutions
with maturities less than 90 days and short-term interest-earning deposits in investment companies. The Company reports net cash
flows for customer loan transactions and deposit transactions.
 
Securities:  Securities are
classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to
maturity. Securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available for sale
are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in other comprehensive income (loss), net
of tax. All securities were classified as available for sale as of December 31, 2011.
 
Interest income from securities includes
amortization of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without
anticipating prepayments. Gains and losses on sales of securities are recorded on the settlement date, which is not materially
different from the trade date, and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no unsettled securities
transactions at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary
impairment (“OTTI”) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such
an evaluation.
 
In evaluating OTTI, management considers
many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the
financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions,
and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt
security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree
of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. The amount of the OTTI
recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required
to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If we intend to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis,
less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost
basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not
that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI
is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total
OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized
as a charge to earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net
of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis
of the investment.

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 
Loans Held for Sale: The Bank originates
and purchases one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that are held for sale in the secondary market. Loans held for sale
are carried at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate with adjustments for unrealized losses recorded in a valuation account
by a charge against current earnings. Sales in the secondary market are recognized when full acceptance has been received. Loans
are generally sold servicing released. Loans purchased and held for sale include loans originated under the Bank’s warehouse
lending program under which the Bank holds a lien position which is not released until the sale is completed and proceeds are received.
Generally these loans are sold at par and are held for a short duration (usually less than 30 days) while earning interest until
a sale is completed to an investor.
 
The Company also originates loans through
the 7(a) Program and the 504 Program of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The 7(a) loans are guaranteed up
to 75% of the loan amount up to maximum guaranty cap of $3,750,000. The Company’s average loan size is approximately $450,000.
The Company typically sells the guaranteed portion of the 7(a) loan in to the secondary market at a premium, retaining the servicing
of the loan. These loans are non-recourse to the lender, other than an allegation of fraud on the part of the lender.
 
In the 504 program the Company, the SBA
and the borrower are in various lien positions. The typical structure of a 504 loan is the Bank is at a 50% loan-to-value (“LTV”),
the SBA is in second position at 40% LTV, while the remaining 10% is an equity injection from the borrower.
 
Loans: Loans that management has
the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding,
net of unearned loan fees and costs, premiums on loans purchased, and an allowance for loan losses.
 
The Bank may also purchase loans that conform
to our underwriting standards, principally one-to-four family residential mortgages, in the form of whole loans for interest rate
risk management and portfolio diversification and to supplement our organic growth.

principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income
using the level-yield method over the estimated life of the loan. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or
discounts on loans purchased. Premiums and discounts are amortized on the level yield-method over the estimated life of the loan.
 
Accrual of interest income on mortgage
and commercial loans is discontinued, and the loan is placed on non-performing status at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent
unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
In all cases, loans are placed on non-performing or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered
doubtful.
 
Loans for which the terms have been modified
as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). TDRs are measured
for impairment based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loans existing rate at inception of the loan
or the appraised value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impairment of homogenous loans, such as one-to-four
residential loans, that have been modified as TDRs is calculated in the aggregate based on the present value of estimated future
cash flows. Loans modified as TDRs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and
until the loan has performed for 12 months in accordance with the modified terms. The assessment of market rate of interest for
homogenous TDR loans is done based on the weighted average rates those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time
of restructure.
 
All interest accrued but not received on
loans placed on non-performing status is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on
the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the
principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses: An
allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The
allowance is maintained at a level that, in management’s judgment, is adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in
the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through
a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Generally, loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes
the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. In the case of loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential property
the loan is charged down by the expected loss amount at the time it becomes non-performing. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are
credited to the allowance.

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 
The
allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires
estimates and assessment of risk that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Management’s
methodology for estimating the allowance for loan loss for the periods included in these financial statements is explained below.
 
The
extended recession and the severe deterioration of real estate values over the last three years has increased the risk of loss
associated with any loan collateralized by real estate. The degree of risk between loans collateralized by real estate varies according
to the relative size of loans and the difficulty of obtaining possession of the collateral in order to recover its value in repayment
of the loan. 
 
When establishing the allowance for loan
losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories generally based on the nature of the collateral and the basis of repayment.
These risk categories and the relevant risk characteristics are as follows:
 
Real
estate loans
 

·One-to-four family residential loans have
historically had less risk than other loan types as they tend to be smaller balance loans without concentrations to a single borrower
or group of borrowers. Repayment depends on the individual borrower’s capacity. Given the rapid deterioration in the market
value of residential real estate over the last several years, there is now a greater risk of loss if actions such as foreclosure
or short sale become necessary to collect the loan and private mortgage insurance was not purchased. In addition, depending on
the state in which the collateral is located, the risk of loss may increase, due to the time required to complete the foreclosure
process on a property. 
 

·Commercial real estate loans generally
have greater credit risks compared to one-to-four family residential real estate loans, as they usually involve larger loan balances
secured by non-homogeneous or specific use properties. Repayment of these loans typically relies on the successful operation of
a business or the generation of lease income by the property and is therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the economy
and real estate market. 
 

·Other real estate loans include loans
secured by multi-family residential real estate and land. Generally these loans involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential
real estate loans, but are generally smaller individual loan balances than commercial real estate loans; land loans due to the
lack of cash flow and reliance on borrower’s capacity and multi-family due the reliance on the successful operation the project.
Both loan types are also more sensitive to adverse economic conditions.

Real estate construction loans
 

·Real estate construction loans, including
one-to-four family, commercial and acquisition and development loans, generally have greater credit risk than traditional one-to-four
family residential real estate loans. The repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties
or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that
is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction
loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or accordance with specifications and projected costs.
 
Other loans
 

·Home equity loans and home equity lines
are similar to one-to-four family residential loans and generally carry less risk than other loan types as they tend to be smaller
balance loans without concentrations to a single borrower or group or borrowers. However, similar to one-to-four family residential
loans, risk of loss has increased over the last several years due to deterioration of the real estate market.
 

·Consumer loans often are secured by depreciating
collateral, including cars and mobile homes, or are unsecured and may carry more risk than real estate secured loans. Consumer
loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely
affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 

·Commercial loans are secured by business
assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and
the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue and possess greater risk than most other types of loans
should the repayment capacity of the borrower not be adequate.
 
Management’s
methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include a general loss component
by class of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans. The allowance also incorporates the results of measuring
impaired loans.
 
The general component of the allowance
covers unimpaired loans and is based on the historical loss experience adjusted for other qualitative factors. The loan portfolio
is stratified into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics and an appropriate loss ratio
adjusted for other qualitative factors is applied to the homogeneous pools of loans to estimate the incurred losses in the loan
portfolio. The other qualitative factors considered by management include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

·Economic trends – local and national

·Expertise of management and staff of the
Bank

·Volumes and terms of loans

·Current delinquency levels and trends

·Non-performing asset levels and trends
and related charge-off history

·Changes in loan policy

·Concentrations of credit 
 
The specific reserve component of the allowance
for loan losses generally relates to loans that have been classified as doubtful, substandard, or special mention according to
the Company’s internal asset classification system of identifying problem and potential problem loans. Substandard loans
include those characterized by the distinct possibility the Company may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that
the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values,
highly questionable and improbable. Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification
in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention are deemed to be
special mention. Risk ratings are updated any time the facts and circumstances warrant.
 
For loans that are
also identified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market
price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and
events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors used by management to determine impairment include payment status, collateral
value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant
payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment
delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan
and the borrower, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Troubled debt restructurings
(TDRs) with borrowers where the Bank has granted a concession to the borrower because of their financial difficulties are considered
impaired loans. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for non-homogenous loans such as commercial real estate, commercial
real estate construction, and commercial business loans greater than $250,000 by either the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, including one-to-four family
residential real estate loans and consumer loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, consumer and one-to-four
family residential real estate loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject
of a restructuring agreement.

Loans are charged off against the Allowance
for Loan Loss account when the following conditions are present:
 
Real
estate loans
 

·One-to-four family loans balances are
charged down by the expected loss amount at the time they become non-performing, which is
generally 90 days past due. Due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weakness of the U.S. economy in general,
it is increasingly likely that impairment allowances on non-performing collateral dependent loans, particularly one-to-four family
residential loans, will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss. This process accelerates the recognition of charge-offs
but has no impact on the impairment evaluation procedures. Additional losses, if any, are charged off against the allowance for
loan losses once a property is foreclosed or a short sale occurs.
 

·Commercial real estate loans and other
real estate loans, including commercial land and multi-family loans, typically have specific reserves established once a loan is
classified as substandard unless the collateral is adequate to cover the balance of the loan plus selling costs. Generally, the
specific reserve on a loan will be charged off once the property has been foreclosed and title to the property transferred to the
Bank. 
 
Real estate construction loans
 

·Real estate construction loans include
one-to-four family, commercial and acquisition and development loans. These loans typically have specific reserves established
once a loan is classified as substandard unless the collateral is adequate to cover the balance of the loan plus selling costs.
Generally, the specific reserve on a loan will be charged off once the property has been foreclosed and title to the property transferred
to the Bank.
 
Other loans
 

·First lien position home equity loans
are charged down by the expected loss amount at the time they become non-performing, which
is generally 90 days past due. In the case of second lien position loans the entire loan balance is charged off. Due to
declining real estate values in our markets and the deterioration of the US economy in general, it is increasingly likely that
impairment allowances on non-performing collateral dependent loans, particularly one-to-four family residential loans, will not
be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss. This process accelerates the recognition of charge-offs but has no impact on the
impairment evaluation procedures. Additional losses, if any, are charged off against the allowance for loan losses once a property
is foreclosed or a short sale occurs.
 

·Consumer loans including auto, manufactured
housing, unsecured, and other secured loans are charged-off, net of expected recovery when the loan becomes significantly past
due over a range of up to 180 days, depending on the type of loan. Loans with non-real estate collateral are written down to the
value of the collateral, less cost to sell, when repossession of collateral has occurred.

·Commercial loans secured by business assets,
including inventory and receivables, will typically have specific reserves established once a loan is classifies as substandard.
The specific reserve will be charged off once the outcomes of attempts to legally collect the collateral are known and have been
exhausted. 
 
Concentration of Credit Risk: Much
of the Company’s business activity is with customers in northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. Therefore, the Company’s
exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy and real estate markets in northeast Florida and southeast
Georgia.
 
Transfers of Financial Assets: Transfers
of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets
is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free
of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the
Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.
 
Other Real Estate Owned and Foreclosed
Assets: Assets acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated selling
costs, at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation
allowance is recorded through expense. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to the
holding of property are expensed.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock: Atlantic
Coast Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). Members are required to own a certain amount of FHLB stock
based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock has no quoted market value,
is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of
cost. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
 
Land, Premises, and Equipment: Land
is carried at cost. Buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Premises and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Buildings and related components have useful lives ranging from 15 to 39 years. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment have useful
lives ranging from 1 to 15 years. Interest expense associated with the construction of new facilities is capitalized at the weighted
average cost of funds.
 
Bank Owned Life Insurance: The Company
has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be
realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or
other amounts due that are probable at settlement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) has a policy
to restrict federal savings institutions from investing more than 25% of total capital in bank owned life insurance without first
notifying and obtaining authorization from the OCC. The OCC is aware that as of December 31, 2011 the Bank was not in compliance
with this policy.

Earnings Per Common Share: Basic
earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period, reduced for unallocated ESOP shares as well as shares associated with other compensation plans. Diluted earnings per common
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period increased for
the dilutive effect of unvested stock options and stock awards. The dilutive effect of the unvested stock options and stock awards
is calculated under the treasury stock method utilizing the average market value of the Company’s stock for the period. Average
shares and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 have been restated to reflect the second step conversion
and offering completed February 3, 2011.
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible
assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment
is recognized in the period identified. An assessment of goodwill impairment was performed during the third quarter of 2009 in
advance of the date of normal annual review. Based on the results of that analysis, an impairment charge of $2.8 million was recorded
in the third quarter of 2009, leaving no goodwill on the balance sheet.
 
Other intangible assets consist of non-maturity
deposit intangible assets arising from branch acquisitions. Non-maturity deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value
and then are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 4 to 10 years.
 
Long-Term Assets: Premises and equipment,
non-maturity deposit and other intangible assets, and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their
carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.

 
Benefit Plans: Profit-sharing and
401k plan expense is the amount contributed as determined by Board decision. Deferred compensation plan expense is allocated over
years of service.
 
Rabbi Trusts: Vested but unpaid
benefits for the executive deferred compensation plan, director retirement plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan
for certain executives is funded with the Company’s own common stock held in Rabbi Trusts. Unpaid benefits are recorded as
contra accounts to stockholders’ equity at cost and are reduced as benefits are paid out by the Trustee over the terms defined
by the plans.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):
Since the Company sponsors the ESOP with an employer loan, neither the ESOP's loan payable or the Company's loan receivable are
reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Likewise, the Company does not recognize interest income or interest cost
on the loan. Unallocated shares held by the ESOP are recorded as unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated statement of changes
in stockholders' equity. As shares are committed to be released for allocation, the Company recognizes compensation expense equal
to the average market price of the shares for the period. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares reduce retained earnings; dividends
on unearned ESOP shares are used to reduce the ESOP loan balance at the Company.
 
In connection with the second step conversion,
the Company sold 1,710,857 shares of common stock at $10 per share, inclusive of 68,434 shares issued to the Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation employee stock ownership plan. The Company loaned $684,000 to a trust for the ESOP, enabling it to purchase 68,434
shares of common stock in the stock offering for allocation under such plan.
 
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company
records compensation cost for restricted stock or stock options awarded to employees in return for employee service. The cost is
measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense over the employee service period, which
is normally the vesting period. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market
price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards.
 
Income Taxes: Income tax expense
is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company
files consolidated income tax returns and allocates tax liabilities and benefits among subsidiaries pursuant to a tax sharing agreement.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts
and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
A tax position is recognized as a benefit
only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded.
 
The Company recognizes interest expense
and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Loss Contingencies: Loss contingencies,
including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood
of loss is probable and amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are currently any
such matters that will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
 
Loan Commitments and Related Financial
Instruments: Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments including commitments to make loans and unused
lines of credit, issued to meet customers' financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before
considering collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
 
Derivatives: Derivative financial
instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value. The Company’s derivatives consist mainly of interest rate
swap agreements, which are used as part of its asset liability management to help manage interest rate risk. All of the Company’s
interest rate swaps matured during 2011. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings, as non-interest income.
 
Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive
income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes the net change
in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on securities available for sale, net of tax, which are recognized as separate components
of equity.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed
in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit
risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or
in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.
 
Operating Segments: The chief decision-makers
monitor operating results and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, the Company does not have
multiple operating segments.
 
Restrictions on Cash: The Bank was
not required to maintain cash on hand or on deposit with the Federal Reserve at the year-end 2011 and 2010 to meet regulatory reserve
and clearing requirements.
 
Dividends: Banking regulations require
maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Company or by the Company to shareholders.

NOTE 2 – SECURITIES AVAILABLE
FOR SALE (continued)
 
Other-Than-Temporary-Impairment
 
As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s
security portfolio consisted of 33 securities, 11 of which were in an unrealized loss position. Nearly all unrealized losses are
related to debt securities whose underlying collateral is residential mortgages. However, the majority of these securities were
issued by government sponsored organizations as discussed below.
 
At December 31, 2011, approximately $125.9
million, or 99% of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline
in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does
not have the intent to sell these securities and it is not likely the Company will be required to sell the securities before their
anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
 
The Company recorded an expense for other-than-temporary
impairment charge of approximately $186,000 and $423,000 in non-interest income on private label mortgage-backed mezzanine (support)
bonds for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The table below presents detail of other-than-temporary
impairment charges recognized in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

NOTE 4 - LOANS, NET (continued)
 
Non-performing loans, including non-performing
loans, at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $46.6 million and $28.1 million, respectively. There were no loans over 90 days past-due
and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. Non-performing loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans
that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified as impaired loans.
 
The Company utilizes an internal asset
classification system for loans other than consumer and residential loans as a means of reporting problem and potential problem
loans. Under the risk rating system, the Company classifies problem and potential problem loans as “Special Mention”,
“Substandard”, and “Doubtful”. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility
the Company may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful, or risk rated seven, have
all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic the weaknesses present make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans
that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories,
but possess weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention are deemed to be Special Mention, or risk rated five. Risk
ratings are updated any time the facts and circumstances warrant.
 
The Company evaluates consumer and residential
loans based on whether the loans are performing or non-performing as well as other factors. One-to-four family and home equity
loan balances are charged down by the expected loss amount at the time they become non-performing,
which is generally 90 days past due. In the case of second lien position loans the entire loan balance is charged off. Consumer
loans including automobile, manufactured housing, unsecured, and other secured loans are charged-off, net of expected recovery
when the loan becomes significantly past due over a range of up to 180 days, depending on the type of loan.
 
The following table presents the risk category
of those loans evaluated by internal asset classification based on the most recent analysis performed and the contractual aging

NOTE 4 - LOANS, NET (continued)
 
Loans for which the concessions have been
granted as a result of the borrower’s financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”).
These concessions, which in general are applied to all categories of loans, may include a reduction in the interest rate on the
loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, or a combination of these or other actions intended to maximize collection.
 
For homogenous loan categories, such as
one-to-four family residential loans and home equity loans, the amount of impairment resulting from the modification of the loan
terms is calculated in aggregate by category of loan. The resulting impairment is included in the general component of the allowance
for loan losses. If an individual homogenous loan defaults under terms of the TDR and becomes non-performing, the Bank follows
its usual practice of charging the loan down to its estimated fair value and the charge-off is considered as a factor in determining
the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses.
 
For larger non-homogeneous loans, each
loan that is modified is evaluated individually for impairment based on either discounted cash flow or, for collateral dependent
loans, the appraised value of the collateral less selling costs. The amount of the impairment, if any, is recorded as a specific
reserve in the allowance for loan loss reserve. There was an allocated allowance for loan losses for loans individually evaluated
for impairment of approximately $6.0 million and $3.9 million at December 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

Loans modified as TDRs with market rates
of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for 12 months in accordance
with the modified terms. The assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous TDR loans is done based on the weighted average
rates those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure. TDRs classified as impaired loans as of December
31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

NOTE 5 - FAIR VALUE
 
Fair value is the exchange price
that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
 
Level 2: Significant other observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
 
Level 3: Significant other unobservable
inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability.
 
The Company used the following methods
and significant assumptions to estimate fair values:
 
Investment Securities:
The fair values for investment securities
are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values
are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar
securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted
cash flows are calculated using spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate prepayment speeds, loss severities,
volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate
the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed
and incorporated into the calculations.
 
Impaired Loans
The fair values of impaired loans that
are collateral dependent are based on a valuation model which incorporates the most current real estate appraisals available, as
well as assumptions used to estimate the fair value of all non-real estate collateral as defined in the Bank’s internal loan
policy (Level 3 inputs). 
 
Derivatives
The fair value of derivative financial
instruments is based on derivative valuation models using market data inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2 inputs).
 
Other Real Estate Owned
Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial
and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”) are measured at fair value, less
costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property, resulting in a Level 3 classification.

Level 3 assets measured at fair value on
a recurring basis were comprised of private label debt securities. Due to market conditions for these types of debt securities
in 2009, 2010 and 2011, information regarding fair value became unavailable or unreliable. Consequently these debt securities were
evaluated utilizing discounted cash flow models for each of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Company held no private label debt
securities as of December 31, 2011.

The Company had mortgage, home equity and
commercial loans totaling approximately $318.3 million and $238.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 pledged as collateral
for the FHLB advances. At December 31, 2011, the remaining borrowing capacity was $63.8 million. At December 31, 2011 and 2010
Atlantic Coast Bank owned $9.6 million and $10.2 million, of FHLB stock, respectively, which also secures debts to the FHLB.
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2011, the Company
received notice from FHLB of Atlanta that our borrowing capacity had been reduced by approximately $30.0 million.
 
The Company refinanced $30 million in FHLB
advances during 2008 that resulted in a penalty of approximately $471,000 to be amortized over 5 years, the amortization is reflected
in interest expense. The refinanced borrowing was repaid during 2010 resulting in the accelerated amortization of the $220,000
remaining balance of the prepayment penalty.
 
NOTE 10 – OTHER BORROWINGS
 
Other
borrowings were $0 and $5.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company borrowed $5.0 million, at market rates,
from another financial institution in June 2010 secured by shares of the Company’s common stock owned by Atlantic Coast Federal,
MHC. The Company’s Chairman of the Board also serves as the president and chief executive officer and a director of the financial
institution from which the borrowing was obtained. The Company repaid the $5.0 million loan with proceeds from the second step
conversion and offering in February 2011. 
 
NOTE 11 – SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE
 
The Company has securities sold under agreements
to repurchase with a carrying amount of $92.8 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Under the terms of the agreements the counterparties
require that the Company provide additional collateral for the borrowings as protection for their market risk when the fair value
of the borrowings exceed the contractual amounts. As a result, the Company had $122.2 and $120.4 million
in securities posted as collateral for these instruments at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company will be required
to post additional collateral if the gap between the market value of the liability and the contractual amount of the liability
increases.

Beginning
in January 2009, the lender has the option to terminate individual advances in whole the following quarter; there is no termination
penalty if terminated by the lender. There have been no early terminations. In the event the Bank’s regulatory capital
ratios fall below well-capitalized it may be required to provide additional collateral. In the event the capital ratios fall below
adequately capitalized, or the Bank receives a cease and desist order from its primary banking regulator, the counterparty on $77.8
million of the $92.8 million total has the option to call the debt at its fair value. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of that
portion of the debt exceeded the carrying value by approximately $12.5 million. At maturity
or termination, the securities underlying the agreements will be returned to the Company.
 
NOTE 12 - INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
 
On occasion the Company has utilized
interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position
by mitigating the impact of significant unexpected fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility or changes in the
yield curve. As of December 31, 2011 the Company had no interest rate swap agreements in place.

NOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 

Defined Contribution Plan: Company
employees, meeting certain age and length of service requirements, may participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by the Company. Plan
participants may contribute between 1% and 75% of gross income, subject to an IRS maximum of $16,500 with a company match equal
to 50% of the first 6% of the compensation contributed. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the total plan expense
was $149,000, $68,000 and $5,000, respectively. The Company re-instituted its matching program in April 2010, which had been suspended
beginning in first quarter of 2009.
 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) and Director Retirement Plan: In December 2009 the Company entered into new agreements to provide SERP's to certain
executives and senior officers and a Director Retirement Plan to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The new agreements
replaced agreements in place prior to December 2009, to the same officers and directors for which the Company had accrued approximately
$3.0 million for vested benefits payable. In connection with entering into the new SERP and Director Retirement Plan agreements,
the Company obtained consents from each SERP participant and Director thereby allowing the Company to reverse the previous benefit
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009. This resulted in negative expense of approximately $2.7 million for the combined SERP and
Director Retirement Plan for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company recorded no expense for SERP or Director Retirement
Plans in 2010 as no events resulting in vesting occurred.
 
Benefits payable under the new SERP's and
Director Retirement plans is based upon the appreciation benefit established for each participant. The appreciation benefit is
generally the amount of each participant's accrued benefit under the pre-December 2009 plans at the date the new plans were put
in place. Under the terms of both the SERP and Director Retirement Plan, each participant will receive a monthly benefit payment
beginning on a date defined by each plan. Under the executive and senior officer SERPs benefit payments begin the first month after
the retirement date while under the Director Retirement Plan benefit payments began on the first month following 100% vesting.
Benefit payments are due over a period of ten (10) to twenty (20) years after retirement and are based on the amount of each participant’s
appreciation benefit plus accrued interest on unpaid balances.

NOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)
 

Vesting in the appreciation benefit for
executive SERP's and the Director Retirement Plans is contingent upon the occurrence of defined events. These events include the
successful completion of the second step conversion, two consecutive quarters of positive income before the expense of participant
vesting by the Company, the participant's death or disability, or a change-of control of the Company. In the case of the executive
SERP vesting also includes involuntary termination of employment. The vested appreciation benefit is payable over 15 years for
executive SERPs and 10 years for the Director Retirement Plan. The vested but unpaid appreciation benefits of the executive SERP
and the Director Retirement Plans are credited for interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points. No expense is recognized
for the new executive SERP or Director Retirement Plan until such time as the Company is able to determine the likelihood and
value of due under the agreements due to the occurrence of defined events.
 
Under the terms of the senior officer SERP
the appreciation benefit is established upon completion of the second step conversion and becomes payable to the participant over
20 years following separation from service due to retirement from the Company, which may be no earlier than age 55. In the event
of a death of a participant with 5 or more years of service a lump sum payment is due to the participant's beneficiary. The participant
forfeits their appreciation benefit if the employee leaves the Company prior to retirement. The unpaid appreciation benefit for
each participant is credited for interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points.
 
On February 3, 2011, the Company completed
the second-step conversion thus triggering vesting under the executive SERPs and Director Retirement Plan (“the Plans”).
Under the terms of the agreements the executive SERP's vested 15% of the appreciation benefit and the Director Retirement Plan
vested 100% in the appreciation benefit resulting in an accrual of benefits payable of $299,000 and $310,000, respectively. The
Plans were partially funded through the creation of a rabbi trust (“the Trust”). The Trust purchased 34,009 shares
of Company stock at $10 per share during the second step conversion and has recorded the purchase as common stock held by benefits
plans in stockholders’ equity. Benefits paid by the Trust may be paid in cash or stock and the assets of the Trust are considered
general assets of the Company. Changes in the fair-value of Company stock are recorded as adjustments to the benefits accrued for
each participant.
 
The senior officer SERP appreciation benefit at the date of the second-step conversion totaled $646,000
and $174,000 was accrued for the benefit of participants based on proximity to retirement

 

The Company recorded expense of $491,000
and $331,000 for SERP and Director Retirement Plans in 2011, including interest on unpaid appreciation benefits and net of reversal
of benefits accrued for senior officer SERP participants who severed their employment. Below is the amount of accrued liability
and unvested appreciation benefit under the SERP and Director Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:

Due to the Supervisory Agreement between the Company and the
OCC and Federal Reserve (See Note 17-Regulatory Matters) payments for appreciation benefits that vest following an executive being
involuntarily terminated or occurring after the executive severs employment are subject to approval by the FDIC and the OCC.
 

Deferred Director Fee Plan: A deferred
director fee compensation plan covers all non-employee directors. Under the plan directors may defer director fees. These fees
are expensed as earned and the plan accumulates the fees plus earnings. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the liability for the plan
was $197,000 and $223,000, respectively.

Split Dollar Life insurance agreement:
The Company has Split Dollar Life insurance agreements with certain executive officers to provide life insurance benefits in addition
to that available to all employees. The expense related to this benefit for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was
$34,000, (17,000) and 41,000, respectively. The Company recorded a credit to expense in 2010 of $84,000 due to the departure of
one executive who surrendered the benefit under the terms of the agreement. The related liability for Split Dollar Life insurance
benefits was $148,000 and $114,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
NOTE 14 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
 
The Company established the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) described below following Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s first step conversion
in 2004. Upon completion of the second step conversion on February 3, 2011, all unallocated shares in the plan were exchanged for
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation shares at a rate of 0.1960 shares of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation for each share of
Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation.
 
In connection with its minority stock offering
in 2004, the Company established an ESOP for the benefit of its employees with an effective date of January 1, 2004. The ESOP purchased
465,520 shares of common stock from the minority stock offering with proceeds from a ten-year note in the amount of $4,655,200
from the Company. The Company's Board of Directors determines the amount of contribution to the ESOP annually but is required to
make contributions sufficient to service the ESOP's debt. Shares are released for allocation to employees as the ESOP debt is repaid.
Eligible employees receive an allocation of released shares at the end of the calendar year on a relative compensation basis. An
employee becomes eligible on January 1st or July 1st immediately following the date they complete one year of service.
Company dividends on allocated shares will be paid to employee accounts. Dividends on unallocated shares held by the ESOP will
be applied to the ESOP note payable.
 
Contributions to the ESOP were $90,000,
$568,000 and $568,000 for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009. Contributions did not include dividends on unearned shares in 2011
and 2010, but included $5,000 in 2009.

plan. The Company’s loan to the ESOP was combined with the remaining debt and modified to be payable over 20 years. Further,
the Plan was modified such that unearned shares held by the plan will be allocated over the same term as the debt.
 
NOTE 15 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The
Recognition Plan
The
Recognition Plan permits the Company’s board of directors to award up to 55,888 shares of its common stock to directors and
key employees designated by the board. As of December 31, 2011 substantially all shares had been awarded. Under the terms of the
Recognition Plan, awarded shares are restricted as to transferability and may not be sold, assigned, or transferred prior to vesting.
Awarded shares vest at a rate of 20% of the initially awarded amount per year, beginning on the first anniversary date of the award,
and are contingent upon continuous service by the recipient through the vesting date; accelerated vesting occurs if there is a
change in control of the Company or death or disability of the participant. The second step conversion completed February 3, 2011
was not considered a change in control. Any awarded shares which are forfeited are returned
to the Company and can be re-awarded to another recipient. The Recognition Plan became effective on July 1, 2005 and remains in
effect for the earlier of 10 years from the effective date, or the date on which all shares of common stock available for award
have vested. 
 
There were no common stock share awards
during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company’s board of directors awarded 1,372 shares of common stock available
under the Recognition Plan during the year ended December 31, 2010. A summary of the status of the shares of the Recognition Plan

The
Stock Option Plan
The Stock Option Plan permits the Company’s
board of directors to grant options to purchase up to 139,720 shares of its common stock to the Company’s directors and key
employees. Under the terms of the Stock Option Plan, granted stock options have a contractual term of 10 years from the date of
grant, with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Key employees
are eligible to receive incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, while outside directors are eligible for non-statutory
stock options only.
 
The Stock Option Plan also permits the
Company’s board of directors to issue key employees, simultaneous with the issuance of stock options, an equal number of
Limited Stock Appreciation Rights (The Limited SAR). The Limited SARs are exercisable only upon a change of control and, if exercised,
reduce one-for-one the recipient’s related stock option grants. Under the terms of the Stock Option Plan, granted stock options
vest at a rate of 20% of the initially granted amount per year, beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant, and are contingent
upon continuous service by the recipient through the vesting date. Accelerated vesting occurs if there is a change in control of
the Company or death or disability of the participant. The second step conversion completed February 3, 2011 was not considered
a change in control. The Stock Option Plan became effective on July 28, 2005 and terminates upon the earlier of 10 years after
the effective date, or the date on which the exercise of Options or related rights equaling the maximum number of shares occurs.
There were 5,496 stock options remaining to be awarded as of December 31, 2011.
 
There were 25,000 and 32,733 of incentive
stock option awards during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no incentive stock option awards
during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The fair value of each option award is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on certain assumptions. Due to the somewhat limited
daily trading volume of shares of our Company stock, the volatility of the SNL thrift index was used in lieu of the historical
volatility of our Company stock. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual term of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of the grant. The expected life of the options is estimated based on historical employee
behavior and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain outstanding. These weighted assumptions are summarized

The Company considers at each reporting
period all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation
allowance is needed to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
 
A determination of the need for a valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets is dependent upon management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. Positive
evidence includes the probability of achieving forecasted future taxable income, applicable tax planning strategies and assessments
of the current and future economic and business conditions. Negative evidence includes the Company’s cumulative losses and
expiring tax credit carryforwards.

NOTE 16 – INCOME TAXES (continued)
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
Company evaluated the expected realization of its federal and state net deferred tax assets which, prior to a valuation allowance,
totaled $25.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively, and was primarily comprised of future tax benefits associated with the allowance
for loan losses and net operating loss carryforwards. Based on this evaluation it was concluded a full valuation allowance was
required for the net federal and state deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance fully offset the benefit in income taxes that
would have been recognized during 2011 and 2010. The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating taxable
income. At December 31, 2009, the Company evaluated the expected realization of its net federal and state deferred tax assets which,
prior to a valuation allowance, totaled $16.2 million and was primarily comprised of future tax benefits associated with the allowance
for loan losses and net operating loss carryforwards. Based on this evaluation it was concluded a valuation allowance equal to
$16.2 million was required for the federal and state deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was recognized as a charge to
income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
 
If the valuation allowance is reduced or
eliminated, future tax benefits will be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense which will have a positive non-cash impact
on our net income and stockholders’ equity.
 
The Company has a federal net operating
loss carryforward of $45.7 million which begins to expire in 2019. There is a valuation allowance of $15.5 million on this carryforward.
The Company has a state net operating loss carryforward of $70.9 million which begins to expire in 2026. The Company maintains
a valuation allowance on $2.7 million of the loss.
 
NOTE 17 - REGULATORY MATTERS
 
Atlantic Coast Bank is subject to regulatory
capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations
involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting
practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings,
as well as other factors, and the regulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements
can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. The prompt corrective action
regulations provide for five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized,
and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition.
 
Under the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act,
the OTS’ functions relating to federal savings associations, including rulemaking authority, were transferred to the Comptroller
of the Currency. The thrift charter has been preserved and a new Deputy Comptroller of the Currency will supervise and examine
federal savings associations and savings banks. At the same time, responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings
and loan holding companies was transferred to the Federal Reserve, which supervises bank holding companies.

At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010,
Atlantic Coast Bank was classified as "well capitalized" under prompt corrective action requirements. There are no conditions
or events since December 31, 2011 that management believes have changed the classification; however, the Bank entered into an individual
minimum capital requirement (“IMCR”) with the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”), the predecessor to
the OCC, on May 13, 2011. Under the IMCR, the Bank agreed to achieve and maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7% at September 30,
2011.
 
Banking regulations limit capital distributions
by savings associations. Generally, capital distributions are limited to undistributed net income for the current and prior two
years. During 2011, Atlantic Coast Bank could not declare any dividends without prior approval of the OCC. Payment of dividends
by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is largely dependent on the ability of Atlantic Coast Bank to pay dividends.

NOTE 17 - REGULATORY MATTERS (continued)
 
The Qualified Thrift Lender test requires
at least 65% of assets be maintained in housing-related finance and other specified areas. If this test is not met, limits are
placed on growth, branching, new investments, FHLB advances, and dividends, or Atlantic Coast Bank must convert to a commercial
bank charter. Management believes this test was met at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
Effective December 10, 2010, the Company,
the Bank and the OTS entered into supervisory agreements. The supervisory agreements have been assumed by the OCC as to restrictions
that relate to the Bank and by the Federal Reserve as to restrictions that relate to the Company. The agreements provide, among
other things, that:
 

•the Bank must not purchase additional bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) or increase its investment in existing
BOLI policies until the Bank’s BOLI exposure is within regulatory guidelines of 25% of total capital;
 

•the Bank must comply with regulations limiting its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits without receiving the written non-objection of the OTS, including reducing its level of brokered deposits to $52.5 million
by June 30, 2011;
 

•the Bank and the Company must comply with regulatory prior notification requirements with respect
to changes in directors and senior executive officers;
 

•the Bank will not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any other capital distributions without
the prior written approval of the OTS, and the Company cannot declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions
without prior written OTS approval;
 

•the Bank and the Company will not be permitted to enter into, renew, extend or revise any contractual
arrangement relating to compensation or benefits for any senior executive officers or directors, unless it provides 30 days prior
written notice of the proposed transaction to the OTS;
 

•the Bank may not enter into any arrangement or contract with a third party service provider that
is significant to the financial condition of the Bank or outside of its normal course of business unless the OTS has received 30
days prior written notice of such contract or arrangement and issued its written non-objection;
 

•the Bank and the Company may not make any golden parachute payment or prohibited indemnification
payment without OTS prior written approval;

NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
In the ordinary course of business,
the Company has various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.
 
The principal commitments as of December
31 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
 


  
December 31, 

  
2011  
2010 

  
(Dollars in Thousands) 

 Undisbursed portion of loans closed 
$1,671  
$7,015 

 Unused lines of credit and commitments to fund loans 
 56,794  
 52,682 

 
At December 31, 2011, the undisbursed portion
of loans closed was primarily unfunded residential construction loans with fixed and variable rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.00%.
At December 31, 2011, the unused lines of credit and commitments to fund loans were made up of both fixed rate and variable rate
commitments. The fixed rate commitments totaled $27.3 million and had interest rates that ranged from 3.25% to 18.00%; variable
rate commitments totaled $29.6 million and had interest rates that ranged from 3.00% to 14.75%.

NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
 
At December 31, 2010, the undisbursed portion
of loans closed was primarily unfunded SBA construction loans with fixed and variable rates ranging from 3.25% to 7.5%. At December
31, 2010, the unused lines of credit and commitments to fund loans were made up of both fixed rate and variable rate commitments.
The fixed rate commitments totaled $35.0 million and had interest rates that ranged from 3.75% to 18%; variable rate commitments
totaled $24.7 million and had interest rates that ranged from 3% to 8.25%.
 
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company
had fully secured outstanding standby letters of credit commitments totaling $206,000 and $170,000, respectively.
  
Since certain commitments to make loans,
provide lines of credit, and to fund loans in process expire without being used, the amount does not necessarily represent future
cash commitments. In addition, commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation
of any condition established in the contract. The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company follows the same credit
policies to make such commitments as is followed for those loans recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
The Company has employment agreements with
its chief operating officer (“COO”), chief financial officer (“CFO”) and chief risk officer. Under the
terms of the agreement, certain events leading to a change in control, or separation from the Company, could result in cash payments
equal to 2.99 times the salary of the COO and CFO, and 1.00 times the salary of the chief risk officer. Since payments are contingent
upon certain events, the Company accrues for no liability. The second step conversion completed February 3, 2011 was not considered
a change in control.
 
During 2011 the Company’s COO announced
his retirement effective February 29, 2012. The employment agreement discussed above terminates upon retirement, accordingly the
Company is no longer subject to the related commitment.
 
The Company maintained a line of credit
with one financial institution for $1.0 million and $7.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no
balances outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
The Company has operating leases in place
for two business locations and certain ordinary office equipment. Lease payments over the next 5 years are approximately $1.2 million.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate
fair value are described as follows:
 
Carrying amount is the estimated fair value
for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest, demand and savings deposits and variable rate loans or deposits that re-price
frequently and fully. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent re-pricing or re-pricing
limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk without
considering the need for adjustments for market illiquidity. Fair value of loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices,
where available, or is determined based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit
risk. Fair value of debt (FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase) is based on current rates for similar
financing. It was not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
Fair value of other borrowings is based on current rates for similar financing. The estimated fair value of other financial instruments
and off-balance-sheet loan commitments approximate cost and are not considered significant to this presentation.

ATLANTIC COAST FINANCIAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009

 

 
NOTE 23 - STOCK CONVERSION
 
On February 3, 2011, the second step conversion
of Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC into a stock holding company structure and related stock offering of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
was completed. As a result of the second step conversion, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation, became
the holding company for the Bank. As part of the second step conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, a Federal corporation,
was merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, with Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation as the surviving entity. In connection
with the conversion the Company sold 1,710,857 shares of common stock at $10 per share, inclusive of 68,434 shares issued to the
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation employee stock ownership plan. In addition, pursuant to an exchange ratio of .1960 the Company
exchanged 4,687,466 shares of common stock held by stockholders of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the predecessor, for 918,324
shares of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, net of fractional shares. As a result of the stock sale and exchange the Company
had 2,629,181 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of February 3, 2011. The reorganization was accounted for as a change
in corporate form with no resulting change in the historical basis of the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity. Direct
offering costs totaling $2.7 million were deducted from the proceeds of the shares sold in the offering. Net proceeds of $14.4
million were raised in the stock offering, excluding $684,000 which was loaned by the Company to a trust for the ESOP enabling
it to purchase 68,434 shares of common stock in the stock offering for allocation under such plan.

Item 9 Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure
 
Not applicable.
 
Item 9A Controls and Procedures
 
(a) Evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the Registrant’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Registrant’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”) ) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
SEC rules and forms.
 
(b) Management’s
report on internal control over financial reporting. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
 
The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
 
This annual report
does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s
report in this annual report.
 

167
 

 
(c) Changes in internal
controls. There were no changes in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(d))
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
