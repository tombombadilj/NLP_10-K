 Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information  
        Certain information set forth in this report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures,
financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as "believes," "expects," "estimates," "may," "will," "should," "anticipates," or "intends" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also
make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these
cautionary statements.
        All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based
upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no
assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly
update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
        There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or
contemplated by this report. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" below. Such factors include, but are
not limited to:


adverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate industry and in the markets in
which we operate;
the effect of competition from new and existing self-storage facilities or other
storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline;
difficulties in our ability to evaluate, finance, complete and integrate acquisitions and
developments successfully and to lease up those properties, which could adversely affect our profitability;
potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental
contamination;
the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and
regulations including, without limitation, those governing Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REITs"), which could increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for
distribution;
disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or
obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;
increased interest rates and operating costs;
reductions in asset valuations and related impairment
charges;
the failure of our joint venture partners to fulfill their obligations to us or their pursuit of
actions that are inconsistent with our objectives;
the failure to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax
purposes;
economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our
business plan; and
difficulties in our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and management
members.

        The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently
available to us. These beliefs, assumptions and  
2



 
Table of Contents
 expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. If a change occurs, our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider these risks before you make an investment
decision with respect to our securities.
        We disclaim any duty or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect
new information, future events or otherwise.
 PART I  
 
   Item 1.    Business     
 General  
        Extra Space Storage Inc. ("we," "our," "us" or the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust ("REIT") formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage
facilities. We closed our initial public offering ("IPO") on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "EXR." 
        We
were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Predecessor"), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977.
These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of December 31, 2011, we held ownership interests in 697 operating properties. Of these
operating properties, 356 are wholly-owned, and 341 are owned in joint venture partnerships. An additional 185 operating properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and operated by us in
exchange for a management fee, bringing the total number of operating properties which we own and/or manage to 882. These operating properties are located in 34 states and Washington, D.C. and contain
approximately 64 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 585,000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 448,000 tenants. 
        We
operate in three distinct segments: (1) property management, acquisition and development; (2) rental operations; and (3) tenant reinsurance. Our property
management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing, redeveloping and selling self-storage facilities. In June 2009, we announced the
wind-down of our development activities. As of December 31, 2011, there was one development project in process. We expect to complete this project by the end of the first quarter of
2012. Our rental operations activities include rental operations
of self-storage facilities. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company's self storage facilities. 
        Substantially
all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating Partnership"). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests
in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to tax, with certain exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our
stockholders. 
        We
file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C.
20549, by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or by accessing the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials
are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our principal offices,

 Management  
        Members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry. The
senior management team has collectively acquired and/or developed 595 properties since our IPO. Our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows: Spencer F. Kirk,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 14 years; P. Scott Stubbs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 11 years; Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief
Legal Officer, 14 years; and Karl Haas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, 24 years. 
        Members
of the executive management team have guided the Company through substantial growth, developing and acquiring over $4.4 billion in assets since 1996. This growth has been
funded through
public equity offerings and private equity capital. This private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated, high net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as
affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. and Fidelity Investments. 
        Our
executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 6,480,191 shares or 6.8%
of our outstanding common stock as of February 15, 2012. 
 Industry & Competition  
        Self-storage facilities refers to properties that offer month-to-month storage space rental for
personal or business use. Self-storage offers a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their
specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units. Self-storage unit sizes typically range
from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of eight to 12 feet. Properties generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the
day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed. 
        Self-storage
provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix
of residential tenants using a self-storage property is determined by a property's local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who
are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that residential tenants place in self-storage properties range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household
items and appliances. Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods. 
        Our
research has shown that tenants choose a self-storage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density,
high-traffic population centers ideal locations for self-storage properties. A property's perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are
also contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most self-storage properties are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis,
tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time. 
        There
are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for self-storage properties. Based on our experience, generally, there is increased leasing activity at
self-storage properties
during the spring and summer months. The highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of July, while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late February and early March.

Table of Contents
        Since
inception in the early 1970's, the self-storage industry has experienced significant growth. In the past few years, there has been even greater growth. According to the
Self-Storage Almanac (the "Almanac"), in 2001 there were only 33,833 self-storage properties in the United States, with an average occupancy rate of 86.1% of net rentable
square feet, compared to 50,048 self-storage properties in 2011 with an average occupancy rate of 79.7% of net rentable square feet. 
        We
have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and
private entities, and this competition will likely continue. 
        The
industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, the top ten self-storage companies in the United States owned approximately 11.1% of
total U.S. self-storage properties, and the top 50 self-storage companies owned approximately 15.1% of the total U.S. properties as of December 31, 2011. We believe this
fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future. We also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for
closing deals. 
        We
are the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. We are one of four public self-storage REITs along with Public Storage Inc., Sovran
Self-Storage, Inc., and CubeSmart. 
 Long-Term Growth and Investment Strategies  
        Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable
long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities, including the
following: 


Maximize the performance of properties through strategic, efficient and
proactive management.  We pursue revenue-generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team
seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our
size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which we believe attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.  
Acquire self-storage properties from strategic partners and
third parties.  Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi-property portfolios that we
believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe
our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.   
Expand our management
business.  Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint.
This expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic
relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale.

We
expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions. We plan to finance future acquisitions and development through a combination of cash, borrowings under the Credit
Lines, traditional secured mortgage financing, joint ventures and additional equity offerings. 


Joint Venture Financing



We
own 336 of our stabilized properties and five of our lease-up properties through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In each
joint venture, we generally manage the day-to-day operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties
or financings by the applicable joint venture. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating
agreements for the joint ventures, we typically maintain the right to receive between 2.0% and 60.0% of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the Company have
received a predetermined return, and between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the Company have received a return of their
capital plus such predetermined return. Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint
venture. 


Disposition of Properties

We
will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth.

Table of Contents 
 Regulation  
        Generally, self-storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating
to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, which
increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep,
safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
        Under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA"), places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties, or restrict further
renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could
result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures. To
the extent our properties are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. 
        Insurance
activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson
Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto. 
        Property
management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state. 
        Changes
in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. 
 Employees  
        As of February 15, 2012, we had 2,239 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not
represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  
 
   Item 1A.    Risk Factors     
        An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in
conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating
results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed. 
        Our
performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties. There are a number of
factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate, including the following: 
 Risks Related to Our Properties and Operations  
 Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating
results.  
        Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our self-storage
properties. Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer 
7



 
Table of Contents
rental
discounts. If our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income,
funds from operations ("FFO"), cash flow, financial condition, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. The following
factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties:


the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be
adversely impacted by, among other factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics; 
periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self-storage or the
public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults; 
a decline or worsening of the current economic environment; 
local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties, the oversupply of self-storage
or a reduction in demand for self-storage in a particular area; 
perceptions by prospective users of our self-storage properties of the safety, convenience and attractiveness
of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located; 
increased operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and
utilities; 
the impact of environmental protection laws; 
earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in
uninsured or underinsured losses; and 
changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws. 

        Recent
U.S. and international market and economic conditions have been challenging, with tighter credit conditions and slower growth. Turbulence in U.S. and international markets may
adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may result in an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. 
 If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of
operations would be adversely affected.  
        Virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as
vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our
growth. 
 We depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and
maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.  
        We had 1,884 field personnel as of February 15, 2012 in the management and operation of our properties. The general
professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean
and secure self-storage properties. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties
could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.

 Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.  
        We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended
coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. In addition, if any
such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the
loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected. 
 Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.  
        Costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. Increases
in income, property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt
obligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions
existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and
results of operations. 
 Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations.  
        Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the
costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or
operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated
by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties
for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials. 
        Certain
environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and
operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal
injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases. 
        Certain
environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances.
For example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions. 
        No
assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our
properties did 
9



 
Table of Contents
not
create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties. There also exists the risk
that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances or regulations
and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability. 
 Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.  
        Under the ADA, places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further
renovations of the properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and
also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our
properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or
other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other legislation, our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could
be adversely affected. 
 We face competition for the acquisition of self-storage properties and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the
cost of these acquisitions.  
        We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of self-storage
properties and other assets, including national,
regional and local operators and developers of self-storage properties. These competitors may drive up the price we pay for self-storage properties or other assets we seek to
acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have
greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment
properties may increase. This competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. Because of an increased interest in single- property
acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay higher prices for
self-storage properties or other assets, our profitability will be reduced. 
 We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.  
        Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition
candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our
acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely
affect our stock price. 
10



 
Table of Contents
        Our
ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant
risks:


competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded
REITs and institutional investment funds; 
competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our
profitability; 
the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;  
failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all; 
we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;
and 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to
unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for
indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 

        In
addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our securities. 
 We may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties.  
        We expect to make future acquisitions of self-storage properties. If we acquire any self-storage properties, we
will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio. The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions
in our operations or may divert management's attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our operating results as a whole. 
 We do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties, and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by
third-party appraisals.  
        We do not always obtain third-party appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us
in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by third-party appraisals. In such cases, the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team. 
 Our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available
for distributions.  
        In June 2009, we announced the wind-down of our development activities. To the extent that we engage in development and
redevelopment activities, we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects:


we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all;  
we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;  
we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required
governmental permits and authorizations; and 

11



 
Table of Contents


occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors,
including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable. 

        In
deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. We may underestimate the costs
necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all.
Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial
condition, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities. 
        We
may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects. If our reputation in the self-storage industry
changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected, which would limit our growth. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure  
 Our business could be harmed if key personnel with long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate their employment with
us.  
        Our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team. Our executive management team has
substantial experience in the self-storage industry. In addition, our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive
management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us.
We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects. 
 We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.  
        We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our
stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this
document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations. 
 If other self-storage companies convert to an UPREIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.  
        Because we are structured as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to tax-motivated sellers than our
competitors that are not structured as UPREITs. However, if other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In
addition, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the
attractiveness of our UPREIT structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions. 
 Tax indemnification obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels.  
        We have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the Operating
Partnership upon acquisition by the Company, including making 
12



 
Table of Contents
available
the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation. We have agreed to these provisions in order to assist
these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our
business. 
 Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.  
        As of December 31, 2011, we held interests in 341 operating properties through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could
be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect
to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new self-storage properties and acquiring existing properties. In such event, we
would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the properties we
currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint
venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the
possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or
other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may
also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture.
Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time
and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to
additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition. 
 Spencer F. Kirk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, and other members of our senior management team
have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us, which could harm our business.  
        Spencer F. Kirk, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as certain other members of our senior management team, have outside
business interests. These business interests include the ownership of a self-storage property located in Pico Rivera, California. Other than this property, the members of our senior
management are not currently engaged in any other self-storage activities outside the Company. These outside business interests could interfere with their ability to devote time to our
business and affairs and, as a result, our business could be harmed. 
 Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.  
        Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating
Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our
Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and
officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in 
13



 
Table of Contents
our
Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to
fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or
engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest. 
        Additionally,
the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general
partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees
for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to
indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising
from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our
Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in
violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful. 
        The
provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we
have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that
purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement. 
 We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers.  
        Spencer F. Kirk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, other
members of our senior management team and Kenneth M. Woolley, Director, had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our Operating Partnership in the
formation transactions. Following the completion of the formation transactions, we, under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests, became entitled to indemnification and damages
in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors. None of these contribution and non-competition agreements was negotiated at an arm's-length basis. We
may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these contribution and non-competition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships
with the individuals party to these agreements. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and
could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.  
        Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve
our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common
stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from
the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant 
14



 
Table of Contents
an
exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors
determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that
might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his
affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his
affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities (as defined in our charter). 
 Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.  
        Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and
to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any
unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our
common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for
our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.  
        Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good
faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition,
our charter eliminates our directors' and officers' liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property
or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for
liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our
directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. 
 To the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a
subsequent sale of common stock.  
        Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to
a U.S. stockholder under current U.S. federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will
constitute a return of capital and will reduce
such adjusted basis. If distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder's adjusted basis in such holder's common stock, subsequent sales of such holder's common stock will result in recognition
of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

 Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry  
 Our primary business involves the ownership and operation of self-storage properties.  
        Our current strategy is to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop only self-storage properties. Consequently,
we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. Because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment
portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change. Decreases in market rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also
increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.  
        Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in
response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing,
interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or
whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a
property. 
        We
may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those
defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other
restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it
necessary or appropriate. 
 Any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply
with re-zoning restrictions or environmental regulations.  
        We have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved properties generally take longer to
yield income-producing returns based on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with
re-zoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an
income-producing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay
operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results. 
 Any negative perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.  
        To the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the value of our securities
may be negatively impacted, which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets.

 Risks Related to Our Debt Financings  
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.  
        In recent years, the U.S. and international credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions.
Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively
affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. A prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and
may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that
we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. 
 Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or
necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.  
        As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in
connection with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under our Credit Lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally
generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings.
Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT or to make our expected distributions. 
        If
we are required to utilize our Credit Lines for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore,
our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:


our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;  
we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue
to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT; 
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms
of our original indebtedness; 
because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase
our interest expense; 
we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;  
after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;  
our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;  
we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing
business and economic conditions; 
we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans
and receive an assignment of rents and leases; 

17



 
Table of Contents


we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees;  
we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt
obligations; and 
our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a
default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties. 

 We could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur.  
        Our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our Operating Partnership may incur. We
could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time. If we become more highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could
adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions and/or to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our REIT
qualification, and could harm our financial condition. 
 Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to
our stockholders.  
        As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.4 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately
$332.9 million or 24.5% was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.7% per
annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions. For example, if market
rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points (excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors), the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $2.6 million annually. 
 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.  
        In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging
involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT  
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.  
        To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net
capital gains, and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4%
nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100%
of our undistributed income from prior years. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy
these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before
December 31, 2011, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of the 
18



 
Table of Contents
distribution
requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock, if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we
may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly long-term, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not
favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the
effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments. 
 Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.  
        The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 15% (through
2012). Dividends paid by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular
corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations
that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our securities. 
        In
addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect
the value of our properties. 
 Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.  
        The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by
the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what
forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed. 
 The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.  
        Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our
stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our
taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders. 
 Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.  
        We believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue
Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for
each of the years involved because:


we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject
to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates; 
we also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and  
unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four
taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.

        In
addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular
corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our
U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If
we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT
status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability
to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities. 
        Qualification
as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like
us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to
qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock. Our ability to
satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent
appraisals. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to income tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent we distribute
less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our
ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. Although we believe that we have been organized and have
operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. We have not
requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our qualification as a REIT. 
 We will pay some taxes.  
        Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local
taxes on our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages self-storage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. We, jointly
with Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT
subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extra Space
Management, Inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on
certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for
inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business),
we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. While we don't intend to sell properties as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are or
our taxable REIT subsidiary is required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.

 Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.  
        To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the
sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to
forego attractive business or investment
opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.  
 
    Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments     
        None.  
 
    Item 2.    Properties     
        As of December 31, 2011, we owned or had ownership interests in 697 operating self-storage properties. Of these
properties, 356 are wholly-owned and 341 are held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 185 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which
we own and/or manage to 882. These properties are located in 34 states and Washington, D.C. We receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6% of cash collected from total revenues to
manage the joint venture, third party and franchise sites. As of December 31, 2011, we owned and/or managed approximately 64 million square feet of rentable space configured in
approximately 585,000 separate storage units. Approximately 77% of our properties are clustered around large population centers, such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These markets contain above-average population and income
demographics for new self-storage properties. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions
have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence. 
        We
consider a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a property to be
stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, over 448,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 882 operating properties that we own and/or manage, primarily on a
month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Although leases are short-term in duration, the
typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time. For properties that were stabilized as of December 31, 2011, the average length of stay was approximately
13 months. The average annual rent per square foot at these
stabilized properties was approximately $13.67 at December 31, 2011, compared to $13.49 at December 31, 2010. 
        Our
property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located. Most often sites are what
we consider "hybrid" facilities, a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities
featuring ground-floor access only. 
        The
following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a state-by-state basis as of December 31,
2011 and 2010. The information as of December 31, 2010, is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at December 31, 2011, were under our control as of December 31,
2010.

    Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
        The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-
looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information." Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or
achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled
"Risk Factors." (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data.)
 Overview  
        We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to
continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties. Since our IPO,
our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of 595 self-storage properties. 
        At
December 31, 2011, we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed 882 operating properties in 34 states and Washington, D.C. Of these 882 operating properties, 356 were
wholly-owned, we held joint venture interests in 341 properties, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional 185 properties that are owned by
franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee. These operating properties contain approximately 64 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 585,000 units and
currently serve a customer base of over 448,000 tenants. 
        Our
properties are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago,
Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These areas all enjoy above average
population growth and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We consider a property to be in
the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80%
occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years. 
        To
maximize the performance of our properties, we employ a state-of-the-art, web-based tracking and yield management technology called
STORE. Developed by our management team, STORE enables us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. In addition, we
also have an industry-leading revenue management system. We believe that the combination of STORE's yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using our revenue
management system allows us to more proactively manage revenues. 
        We
derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self-storage properties, from management fees on the
properties we manage for joint-venture partners, franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program. Our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6% of cash
collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties. We also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures. 
        We
operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple self-storage properties from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact our
property results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the 
27



 
Table of Contents
summer
months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on
the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting
rental rates through the use of STORE, and through the use of our revenue management system. 
        We
continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value
include the following: 


Maximize the performance of properties through strategic, efficient and
proactive management.  We pursue revenue-generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team
seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our
size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which we believe attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.  
Acquire self-storage properties from strategic partners and
third parties.  Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi-property portfolios that we
believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe
our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.   
Expand our management
business.  Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint.
This expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic
relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale. 

        During
2011, we acquired 55 wholly-owned properties and completed the development of five wholly-owned properties, all in our core markets. We have one wholly-owned development property,
which is scheduled for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2012. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  
        Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are
our most critical accounting policies: 
        CONSOLIDATION:    Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities
("VIEs"). An
enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 
        A
VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly
impact the entity's economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive 
28



 
Table of Contents
expected
residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that
provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. 
        We
have concluded that under certain circumstances when we (1) enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a
non-refundable deposit, or (2) enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of
the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the
economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If we are
determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had
no consolidated VIEs. Additionally, our Operating Partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary
beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated. 
         REAL ESTATE ASSETS:    Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs
associated with the
development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction
period are capitalized. 
        Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years. 
        In
connection with our acquisition of properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are
estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of
existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. We measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the
amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value
based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. 
        Intangible
lease rights include: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are
amortized to expense over the term of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the ground leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were different
than the current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms. 
         EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:    We evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be
impairment. We
review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. We focus on properties where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a
significant amount. For these properties, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term.
In addition, we carefully review properties in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections. 
29



 
Table of Contents
        When
we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net
operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the
assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets. 
        When
real estate assets are identified as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair
values, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. The operations of assets held
for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
        FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial
instruments
included in other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable rate notes payable, lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2011 and 2010, approximate fair value. The fair values of our notes receivable, our fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows:

         INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES:    Our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control,
and joint
ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
        Under
the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of
real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of
cash flows, we follow the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts
and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture's sale of
assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity. 
        Our
management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or
circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment, using significant unobservable inputs, is less than its
carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of
the investment. 
         DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:    The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use
of the
derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to 
30



 
Table of Contents
hedge
the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. 
        For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently
reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
         CONVERSION OF OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS:    Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the
original provisions
of the Operating Partnership agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity. The difference between the fair value
of the consideration paid
and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the Company. 
        REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:    Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases
are
generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a
reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned. Management and franchise fee
revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period
of insurance coverage. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is
recognized as earned. 
        Property
expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. We accrue for property tax expense
based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected. 
         REAL ESTATE SALES:    In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands
and risks and
rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale
recognition but require deferral of profit recognition. 
         INCOME TAXES:    We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to
maintain our
qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and
assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. We plan to continue
to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be
subject to federal income tax. We are subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 
        We
have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). In general, our TRS may perform additional services
for tenants and
generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any
person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax.
Deferred tax assets and 
31



 
Table of Contents
liabilities
are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in
income tax expense when incurred. 
        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:    The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and
directors are
based on estimated fair values. Awards are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
        In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05,
"Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2011. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders' equity. In addition, items of other
comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is intended to increase the prominence of
other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive
statements of income and comprehensive income. The Company's adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 
        In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in
U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU No. 2011-04"). ASU No. 2011-04 updates and further clarifies requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. Additionally, ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies the FASB's
intent about the application of existing fair value measurements. ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied
prospectively. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 will have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.

         Property RentalThe increase in property rental revenues consists primarily of an
increase of $20,303 associated with acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010, an increase of $9,934 resulting from increases in occupancy and rental rates to existing customers at our stabilized
properties and an increase of $6,961 related to increases in occupancy at our lease up properties. This is offset by a decrease of $920 related to the sale of 19 properties to a joint venture with
Harrison Street Real Estate Capital LLC ("Harrison Street") in January 2010. 
        Management and Franchise FeesOur taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by our joint ventures,
franchisees and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6% of cash collected from properties owned by third parties, franchisees and unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company also earns an
asset management fee from the Storage Portfolio I ("SPI") joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. 
        During
2011, it was discovered that the asset management fee owed to the Company by the SPI joint venture had not been recorded by either party for the five-year period ended
December 31, 2010. The annual asset management fee for this period was $885. After determining that the amounts were not material either in the prior periods or the current year for restatement
purposes, $4,425 of asset management fees earned during the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, was recorded in the current year. Additionally, asset management fees earned
during the year ended December 31, 2011, of $812 were also recorded. The remainder of the increase in management and franchise fees is related to the increase in third-party properties under
management during 2011 compared to the prior year. We managed 185 third-party properties as of December 31, 2011, compared to 160 as of December 31, 2010. 
        Tenant ReinsuranceThe increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in overall customer participation to 63% at
December 31, 2011, compared to approximately 60% at December 31, 2010. In addition, we operated 882 properties at December 31, 2011, compared to 820 at December 31, 2010.

         Property OperationsThe increase in property operations expense consists primarily of increases of $8,481 related to acquisitions completed in 2011
and 2010, and $1,781 related to increases in expenses at our lease-up properties. These increases were offset by a decrease of $946 resulting from lower expenses at our stabilized
properties, which relates mainly to decreases in property taxes, advertising and utilities expenses. 
        Tenant ReinsuranceTenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. 
         Unrecovered Development and Acquisition CostsThese costs relate to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The increases were related to
increased acquisition activity when compared to the prior year. During 2011, we acquired 55 properties, compared to only 15 during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
        Loss on SubleaseThis expense is a result of a $2,000 charge recorded in the year ended
December 31, 2010, relating to the bankruptcy of a tenant subleasing office space from us in Memphis, TN. The Memphis, TN office lease is a liability assumed as part of the Storage, USA
acquisition in July 2005. There were no such losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
         Severance CostsThe severance costs recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, relate to severance granted to our former Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, Kent Christensen, who left the Company on December 7, 2011. There were no severance costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
         General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the additional costs related to the management of
additional properties. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased 55 properties, 40 of which we did not previously manage. In addition, we managed 185 third-party properties at
December 31, 2011, compared to 160 at December 31, 2010. Also included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, is an expense of $1,800 related
to litigation matters. There were no such expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
        Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition and development of new properties. We
acquired 55 properties and completed the development of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2011.

         Interest ExpenseThe increase in interest expense was primarily the result of costs associated with prepaying certain loans and an increase in the
average amount of debt outstanding when compared to the prior year. 
         Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Exchangeable Senior NotesRepresents the amortization of the discount on
exchangeable senior notes, which reflects the effective interest rate relative to the carrying amount of the liability. 
         Interest IncomeInterest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions. The increase in interest
income is due to slightly higher cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the cash proceeds received from the stock offering in May 2011. 
         Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holder Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the
Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred units of our Operating Partnership (the "Preferred OP units"). 
         Equity in Earnings of Real Estate VenturesThe increase in equity in earnings of real estate ventures was due primarily to an increase in revenues at
joint ventures resulting from increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers. This increase was offset by a reduction of approximately $1,300 from the SPI joint venture as a
result of the asset management fee expense recorded by the joint venture. 
        During
2011, it was discovered that the asset management fee owed to us by the SPI joint venture had not been recorded by either party for the five-year period ended
December 31, 2010. The annual asset management fee for this period was $885, offset by an annual reduction of $221 of equity in earnings of SPI. The total prior period adjustment for the years
2006 through 2010, increased asset management fee revenues by $4,425, and decreased equity in earnings by $1,106 and was recorded in the current year. The remaining reduction to equity in earnings
related to the net effect of the current year asset management fee of $203. 
         Income Tax ExpenseThe decrease in income tax expense relates primarily to solar tax credits. The decrease related to the credit was partially offset
by increased taxes resulting from increased tenant reinsurance income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiary.

         Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership equals the
fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder plus approximately 1.0% and 1.1% of the remaining net income allocated after the adjustment for the fixed distribution paid for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The amount allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interest was higher in 2011 than in 2010 as our net income was higher in 2011
than it was in 2010. 
        Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents
approximately 3.2% and 3.8% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Losses allocated to other noncontrolling interests represents the losses allocated to partners in consolidated joint ventures.

Table of Contents
Street
on January 21, 2010. There was an additional decrease in revenue of $1,682 relating to the deconsolidation of five properties as a result of our adoption of amended accounting guidance
in ASC 810 effective January 1, 2010. These decreases were offset by increases in revenues of $5,852 relating to increases in occupancy at our lease-up properties, $3,319
relating to increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized properties, and $2,371 associated with acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009. 
         Management and Franchise FeesOur taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by our joint ventures,
franchisees and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6% of cash collected from properties owned by third parties, franchisees and unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in
management and franchise fees is related to additional fees earned from the joint venture with Harrison Street and to the increase in third-party properties managed by us compared to the prior year.
We managed 160 third-party properties as of December 31, 2010, compared with 124 as of December 31, 2009. 
         Tenant ReinsuranceThe increase in tenant reinsurance revenues is due to the fact that during the year ended December 31, 2010, we successfully
increased overall customer participation to approximately 60% at December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 54% at December 31, 2009. In addition we operated 820 properties at
December 31, 2010, compared to 766 at December 31, 2009.

         Property OperationsThe decrease in property operations expense was primarily due to decreases of $5,695 related to the sale of 19 properties to an
unconsolidated joint venture with Harrison Street on January 21, 2010, and $692 related to the deconsolidation of five properties as a result of our adoption of amended accounting guidance in
ASC 810 effective January 1, 2010. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $2,762 related to our stabilized and lease up properties and $855 associated with acquisitions completed
in 2010 and 2009. 
        Tenant ReinsuranceTenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The increase in tenant reinsurance
expense is related to the increase in overall customer participation in the tenant reinsurance program to approximately 60% at December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 54% at
December 31, 2009. In addition we operated 820 properties at December 31, 2010, compared to 766 at December 31, 2009. 
         Unrecovered Development and Acquisition CostsThese costs relate to unsuccessful development and acquisition activities during the periods indicated.
On June 2, 2009, the Company announced that 
37



 
Table of Contents
it
had begun a wind-down of its development program. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded $18,883 of one-time impairment charges in order to write down the
carrying value of undeveloped land, development projects that will be completed and investments in development projects to their estimated fair values less cost to sell. 
        Loss on SubleaseThis expense is a result of a $2,000 charge relating to the bankruptcy of a tenant subleasing office space from us in Memphis, TN.
The Memphis, TN office lease is a liability assumed as part of the Storage, USA acquisition in July 2005. 
         Severance CostsOn June 2, 2009, the Company announced that it had begun a wind-down of its development program. As a result of
this decision, the Company recorded severance costs of $1,400. In December 2009, the Company began the closure of its marketing office in Memphis, TN. As a result of this closure, the Company recorded
severance costs of $825. There were no severance costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
        General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the additional costs related to the management of
additional third-party properties. We operated 820 properties at December 31, 2010, compared to 766 at December 31, 2009. 
         Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 19 properties to an unconsolidated
joint venture with Harrison Street on January 21, 2010. This decrease was partially offset by the additional depreciation on new properties added through acquisition and development during 2010
and 2009.

         Interest ExpenseThe decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of a decrease of $5,120 relating to the deconsolidation of the debt related
to the 19 properties sold to an unconsolidated joint venture with Harrison Street on January 21, 2010, and a decrease of $694 related to the deconsolidation of five properties as a result of
our adoption of amended accounting guidance in ASC 810 effective January 1, 2010. These decreases were partially offset as a result of higher interest rates on new loans obtained in 2010
and 2009.

Table of Contents 
         Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Exchangeable Senior NotesThe decrease in non-cash interest
expense related to amortization of discount on exchangeable senior notes for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year was due to the repurchase of a total principal
amount of $122,000 of our notes during 2009. The discount associated with the repurchase of the notes was written off as a result of these repurchases, which decreased the ongoing amortization of the
discount in 2010 when compared to 2009. 
         Interest IncomeThe decrease in interest income is primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our invested cash when compared to the
same period in the prior year, along with a decrease in the average cash balance. 
         Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holder Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the
Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred units of our Operating Partnership (the "Preferred OP units"). 
         Gain on Repurchase of Exchangeable Senior NotesThis amount represents the gain on the repurchase of $122,000 total principal amount of our
exchangeable senior notes during 2009. We did not repurchase any of our exchangeable senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2010. 
         Equity in Earnings of Real Estate VenturesThe decrease is related primarily to additional losses allocated to equity in earnings of real estate
ventures due to the deconsolidation of five lease-up properties as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance in ASC 810 effective January 1, 2010. 
         Income Tax ExpenseThe decrease in income tax expense relates primarily to a $832 solar tax credit that was partially offset by increased taxes
resulting from increased tenant reinsurance income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiary.

         Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership equals the
fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder plus approximately 1.1% of the remaining net income allocated after the adjustment for the fixed distribution paid for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009. The amount allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interest was lower in 2010 than in 2009 as our net income was lower in 2010 than it was in
2009. 
        Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents
approximately 3.8% and 4.4% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
loss allocated to the other noncontrolling interests was

lower
than the prior year due mainly to the deconsolidation of five lease-up properties with other noncontrolling interests effective January 1, 2010 as a result of the adoption of
new accounting guidance in ASC 810. 
 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  
        FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash
flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish
predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the
value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after
adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net
income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the consolidated financial statements. 
        The
computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that
interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative
to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash
distributions. The following table sets forth the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated:

 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2011 to the Year Ended December 31, 2010  
        The increase in same-store rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to incoming and existing customers
and increased occupancy. Occupancy increased 310 basis points over the prior year. The decreases in same-store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, were
primarily due to lower utility costs, a decrease in yellow page advertising and lower than anticipated snow removal costs.

 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010 to the Year Ended December 31, 2009  
        The increase in same-store rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to incoming and existing customers
and increased occupancy. The decreases in same-store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were primarily due to decreases in utilities, office expenses, property
taxes and insurance. 
 CASH FLOWS  
 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2011 to the Year Ended December 31, 2010  
        Cash flows provided by operating activities were $144,164 and $104,815 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The increase when compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in net income. There was also a decrease in the amount of cash used to pay accounts payable and accrued
expenses. These increases were offset by a decrease in cash received from affiliated joint ventures and related parties during 2011 compared to 2010. 
        Cash
used in investing activities was $251,919 and $83,706 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2011 was primarily the result of $125,371
more cash being used to acquire new properties in 2011 compared to 2010. The Company also paid $51,000 to purchase a note receivable, which was offset by $860 of principal payments received in 2011,
compared to $0 in 2010. Additionally, the Company received $15,750 in proceeds from the sale of 19 properties to a joint venture in 2010, compared to $0 in 2011. These increases were offset by a
decrease of $29,002 in the amount of cash used to fund development activities in 2011 compared to 2010. 
        Cash
provided by financing activities was $87,489 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to cash used in financing activities of $106,309 for the year ended
December 31, 2010. The increase in cash provided was the result of $112,349 of net cash proceeds generated from the sale of common stock in the current year, compared with $0 in 2010, along
with an increase of $284,425 in cash proceeds received from notes payable and lines of credit in 2011 when compared to 2010. These increases of cash were offset by the increase of $199,947 of cash
used for principal repayments on notes payable and lines of credit during 2011 when compared to 2010. 
 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010 to the Year Ended December 31, 2009  
        Cash flows provided by operating activities were $104,815 and $81,165 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase when compared to the prior year was due mainly to an increase in cash received from affiliated joint ventures and related parties during 2010 compared to 2009 to repay
receivables from related parties and affiliated real estate joint ventures. The decrease in net income in the current year when compared to the prior year was offset by a gain on the repurchase of
exchangeable senior notes and a loss relating to the wind-down of our development program in 2009. 
        Cash
used in investing activities was $83,706 and $104,410 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in 2010 was primarily the result of $31,239
less cash being used to fund
development activities in 2010 compared to 2009. Additionally, the Company received $15,750 in proceeds from the sale of 19 properties to a joint venture in 2010, compared to $0 in 2009. The decrease
in cash used and proceeds from the sales of properties were offset by an increase of $31,403 in cash used to acquire new properties in 2010 compared to 2009. 
        Cash
used in financing activities was $106,309 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $91,223 for the year ended
December 31, 2009. The decrease in cash provided in 2010 when compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease of $251,498 in the net proceeds from notes payable and lines of
credit in 2010 when compared to 2009, and $39,885 more cash paid for principal payments on notes payable and lines of credit in 2010 when 
42



 
Table of Contents
compared
to 2009. These decreases were partially offset by $87,734 less cash being used to repurchase exchangeable senior notes in 2010 compared to 2009. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
        As of December 31, 2011, we had $26,484 available in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to use this cash to repay debt
scheduled to mature in 2012 and for general corporate purposes. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual
basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
        Our
cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2011, we
experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the
financial markets.

        As
of December 31, 2011, we had $1,359,254 of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.2%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio of total fixed rate debt
and other instruments to total debt was 75.5% (including $342,427 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). The weighted average interest rate of
the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was 4.7%. Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive
covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 2011. 
        We
expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of
OP units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Lines. In addition, we are pursuing additional term loans secured by
unencumbered properties. 
        Our
liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, property acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and non-recurring capital
expenditures. We may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual 
43



 
Table of Contents
restrictions
and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We do not
expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint
ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Any additional
issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of
our common stock. We may also use OP units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
        Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any
obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market
or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 
        Our
exchangeable senior notes provide for excess exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount. See the notes to our financial
statements for a further description of our exchangeable senior notes.

 FINANCING STRATEGY  
        We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although
our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time
to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be 
44



 
Table of Contents
either
fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:


the interest rate of the proposed financing; 
the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties;  
prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing; 
the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing; 
long-term objectives with respect to the financing; 
target investment returns; 
the ability of particular properties, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt
service payments; 
overall level of consolidated indebtedness; 
timing of debt and lease maturities; 
provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization; 
corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets;
and 
the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt. 

        Our
indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular
properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance
properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties,
for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable. 
        We
may from time to time seek to retire, repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt, including our exchangeable senior notes, as well as shares of common stock or other
securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements,
contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 SEASONALITY  
        The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from
May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter
may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.  
 
    Item 7a.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
 Market Risk  
        Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair
values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. 
45



 
Table of Contents
 Interest Rate Risk  
        Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international
economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1,400,000 in total debt, of which approximately $332,900 was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate
swaps). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt (excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors) would
increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2,600 annually. 
        Interest
rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change
in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty
of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc. 
        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Extra Space Storage Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2011 and
2010 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Extra Space Storage Inc.         Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements         December 31, 2011         (Amounts in thousands, except property
and share data)     
 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

        Extra Space Storage Inc. (the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"), formed as a Maryland Corporation on
April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage facilities located throughout the United States. The Company continues
the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The Company's interest in its properties is held through its
operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating Partnership"), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company's primary assets are general partner and limited partner
interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or
UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it
will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. 
        The
Company invests in self-storage facilities by acquiring or developing wholly-owned facilities or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At
December 31, 2011, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in 697 storage facilities. In addition, the Company managed 185 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the
total number of properties which it owns and/or manages to 882, located in 34 states and Washington, D.C. 
        The
Company operates in three distinct segments: (1) property management, acquisition and development; (2) rental operations; and (3) tenant reinsurance. The
Company's property management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing, redeveloping and selling self-storage facilities. In June 2009, the Company
announced the wind-down of its development activities. As of December 31, 2011, there was one remaining development project in process. The Company expects to complete this project
by the end of the first quarter of 2012. The rental operations activities include rental operations of self-storage facilities. No single tenant accounts for more than 5% of rental income.
Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company's self storage facilities. 
 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 Basis of Presentation  
        The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 Variable Interest Entities  
        The Company accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities ("VIEs").
An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or

similar
rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they
occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable
interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. 
        The
Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company (1) enters into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pays a
non-refundable deposit, or (2) enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of
the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to
the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If the
Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company's financial statements. Additionally, the Operating
Partnership has notes payable to three
trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated. 
        The
Company's investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control, and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the
primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 Use of Estimates  
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Reclassifications  
        Certain amounts in the 2010 and 2009 financial statements and supporting note disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not impact previously reported net income or accumulated deficit.

        There
were no transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company did not have any significant
assets or liabilities that are re-measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  
        Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated by the Company for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there
may be impairment. The Company reviews each self-storage facility at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on
facilities where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these facilities, the Company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the
facility will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company carefully reviews facilities in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating
results to original projections. 
        When
the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the
undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows
attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets. 
        When
real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs.
If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. The
operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
        The
Company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or
circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment
has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. 
        As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
        The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable rate notes payable, lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximate
fair value. The fair values of the Company's notes receivable, fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows:

 Real Estate Assets  
        Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the
development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated
with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $752, $2,013, and $4,148,
respectively. 
        Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years. 
        In
connection with the Company's acquisition of self-storage facilities, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based
on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant. Intangible assets,
which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current

leases.
The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on the Company's historical
experience with turnover in its facilities. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. Acquisition-related
transaction costs are expensed as incurred. 
        Intangible
lease rights represent: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are
amortized to expense over the life of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were lower than the
current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms. 
 Investments in Real Estate Ventures  
        The Company's investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint
ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
        Under
the equity method, the Company's investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company's share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions.
Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company's ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of
presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported
under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the
proceeds from the joint venture's sale of assets), in which case it is reported as an investing activity. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents  
        The Company's cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of America and at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 Restricted Cash  
        Restricted cash is comprised of letters of credit and escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the
United States relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.

 Other Assets  
        Other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures, deferred financing costs, customer accounts receivable, investments in
trusts, other intangible assets, income taxes receivable, deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is
computed on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective
debt agreements. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  
        The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges.
Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. 
        For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in the statements of
operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of
earnings, and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 Risk Management and Use of Financial Instruments  
        In the normal course of its ongoing business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are three main components of
economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness
of tenants to make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of properties due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the
value of properties held by the Company. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk. 
 Conversion of Operating Partnership Units  
        Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original provisions of the Operating Partnership
agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to the Company's equity. The difference between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the adjustment to the
carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital for the Company. 
 Revenue and Expense Recognition  
        Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on
month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to
rental income

over
the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized as income when earned. Management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly
as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. Equity in
earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned. 
        Property
expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax
expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected. 
 Real Estate Sales  
        In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and
rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale
recognition but require deferral of profit recognition. 
 Advertising Costs  
        The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to directory, direct mail, internet and other advertising. Direct response
advertising costs are deferred and amortized over the expected benefit period determined to be 12 months. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $860 and $1,073, respectively,
of prepaid advertising included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognized $5,958, $6,430 and $5,892 in
advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
 Income Taxes  
        The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to
maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature
of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to
stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company
were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax
expense on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 0.0% (unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualifies as a return of capital.

 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
        The
Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc. ("ESMI"), as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). In general, the Company's TRS may perform
additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or any
lodging facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is
subject to corporate federal income tax. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESMI, generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to corporate federal income tax and state
insurance premiums tax. 
        Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there
were no material unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
the Company had no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions. 
 Stock-Based Compensation  
        The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors are based on
estimated fair values. Awards granted are valued at fair value and any compensation element is recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. 
 Net Income Per Share  
        Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding including
unvested share based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company
over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares
and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued and is calculated using either the treasury stock or
if-converted method. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, convertible debt, exchangeable Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Operating Partnership units
("Preferred OP units") and exchangeable Operating Partnership units ("OP units")) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings but could do so in the future by virtue of their option or
conversion right. In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security. The
numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In
computing diluted earnings per share, only potential common shares that are dilutive, those that reduce earnings per share, are included. 
        The
Company's Operating Partnership has $87,663 of exchangeable senior notes issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2011, that also can potentially have a dilutive effect on
its earnings per

share
calculations. The exchangeable senior notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company's common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the
exchangeable senior notes. The exchangeable senior notes are exchangeable if the price of the Company's common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price for a specified
period during a quarter, and under certain other circumstances. The exchange price was $23.20 per share at December 31, 2011, and could change over time as described in the indenture. The price
of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130% of the exchange price for the specified period of time during the fourth quarter of 2011. The exchangeable senior notes are also exchangeable at any
time from March 1, 2012 through April 1, 2012. 
        The
Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the exchangeable senior notes relative to its exchange obligations, but has retained the right to
satisfy the exchange obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock. Though the Company has retained that right, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 260,
"Earnings Per Share," requires an assumption that shares will be used to pay the exchange obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount, and
requires that those shares be included in the Company's calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method. No
shares were included in the computation at December 31, 2011, as the shares in excess over the accreted principal would have been anti-dilutive. For the years ending
December 31, 2010 and 2009, no shares were included in the computation because there was no excess over the accreted principal for these periods. 
        For
the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential conversion of Preferred OP units into common shares, where the Company has the option to redeem in
cash or shares and where the Company has stated the positive intent and ability to settle at least $115,000 of the instrument in cash (or net settle a portion of the Preferred OP units against the
related outstanding note receivable), only the amount of the instrument in excess of $115,000 is considered in the calculation of shares contingently issuable for the purposes of computing diluted
earnings per share as allowed by ASC 260-10-45-46. 
        For
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, options to purchase approximately 107,523 shares, 1,788,142 shares, and 4,925,153 shares of common stock, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. All restricted stock grants have been included in basic and diluted shares outstanding
because such shares earn a non-forfeitable dividend and carry voting rights.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
        In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income
(Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. This guidance eliminates the
option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders' equity. In addition, items of other comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or
loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by
requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The
Company's adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 
        In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in
U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU No. 2011-04"). ASU No. 2011-04 updates and further clarifies requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. Additionally, ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of existing fair value measurements. ASU
No. 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods

        The
Company amortizes to expense intangible assetstenant relationships on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the
facility (currently estimated at 18 months). The Company amortizes to expense the intangible lease rights over the terms of the related leases. Amortization related to the tenant relationships
and lease rights was $2,633, $907, and $1,905, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining balance of the unamortized lease rights will be amortized over
the next 6 to 50 years. 
        In
June 2009, the Company announced the wind-down of its development activities. As a result of this change, the Company reviewed its properties under construction,
unimproved land and its investment in development joint ventures for potential impairments. This review included the preparation of updated models based on current market conditions, obtaining
appraisals and reviewing recent sales and list prices of undeveloped land and mature self storage facilities. Based on this review, the Company identified certain assets as being impaired. The
impairments relating to long-lived assets where the Company intends to complete the development and hold the asset are the result of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows being less
than the current carrying value of the assets. The Company compared the carrying value of certain undeveloped land and seven vacant condominiums that the Company intended to sell to the fair market
value of similar undeveloped land and condominiums. For the assets that the Company intended to sell, where the current estimated fair market value less costs to sell was below the carrying value, the
Company reduced the carrying value of the asset to the current fair market value less selling costs and recorded an impairment charge. These assets were classified as held for sale. The impairments
relating to investments in development joint

ventures
were the result of the Company comparing the estimated current fair market value to the carrying value of the investment. For those investments in development joint ventures where the current
estimated fair market value was below the carrying value, the Company reduced the investment to the current fair market value through an impairment charge. Losses relating to changes in fair value
were included in unrecovered development and acquisition costs on the Company's statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. No impairment losses were recorded during the
years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010. During 2011, the Company decided to lease the seven condominiums and as such they are no longer included in real estate assets held for sale. The rental
income related to the condominiums is included in property operations and was immaterial for the year ending December 31, 2011. Real estate assets held for sale included in net real estate
assets as of December 31, 2011 are recorded at fair value and consisted of undeveloped land. 
        On
April 10, 2009, the Company sold vacant land in Los Angeles, California for cash of $4,652. A loss of $343 was recorded as a result of this sale, and is included in unrecovered
development and acquisition costs in the consolidated statement of operations.

        As part of the acquisition of the 19-property portfolio purchased on October 19, 2011, the Company assumed three different
mortgage loans with a total amount due of $68,681 at the closing date. At the time of purchase, the Company recorded a $4,846 premium on the debt assumed in order to record the loans at their fair
values at the purchase date. This premium is included in premium (discount) on notes payable in the consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the
loans.

generated
through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest. 
        In
accordance with ASC 810, the Company reviews all of its joint venture relationships quarterly to ensure that there are no entities that require consolidation. As of
December 31, 2011, there were no previously unconsolidated entities that were required to be consolidated as a result of this review. 
        On
December 1, 2011, the Company purchased Everest Real Estate Fund LLC's interest in Storage Associates Holdco, LLC, a joint venture in which the Company previously
held a 10% equity interest, for $4,941 in cash and a $4,850 promissory note. This joint venture owned six properties located in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island. These
properties became wholly-owned and consolidated as of the date of the purchase. During September 2011, the Company purchased a note payable due from Holdco to the Bank of America for $51,000. The note
payable had a monthly interest rate of LIBOR plus 185 basis points and was due in March 2012. Upon the purchase of the remaining equity interest in Holdco on December 1, 2011, the balance of
the note of $50,140 was assumed by the Company and is subsequently eliminated in consolidation. 
        On
January 1, 2011, the Company paid $320 in cash to obtain its joint venture partners' equity interests in a joint venture. No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction.
The joint venture owned a single stabilized self-storage property located in Pennsylvania and was previously accounted for under the equity method. The property is now wholly-owned and
consolidated by the Company. 
        On
June 28, 2010, the Company contributed $6,660 to ESW as a result of a capital call related to the joint venture's repayment of its $16,650 loan. On August 25, 2010, ESW
closed on a new loan and on August 30, 2010, ESW returned $6,660 of investment capital to the Company. 
        On
June 15, 2010, the Company paid $193 to obtain an additional 7.2% percentage interest in ESSM, increasing the Company's interest in the venture from 41.0% to 48.2%. 
        On
January 21, 2010, the Company closed a joint venture transaction with an affiliate of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital LLC ("Harrison Street"). Harrison Street
contributed approximately $15,800 in cash to the joint venture in return for a 50.0% ownership interest. The Company contributed 19 wholly-owned properties and received approximately $15,800 in cash
and a 50.0% ownership interest in the joint venture. The joint venture assumed approximately $101,000 of existing debt which is secured by the properties. The properties are located in California,
Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The Company continues to operate the properties and receives a 6.0% management fee. The Company's 50% joint venture interest is
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

 Variable Interests in Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures:  
        The Company has interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures with unrelated third parties which are variable interest entities
("VIEs" or the "VIE JVs"). The Company holds 18% and 39% of the equity interests in the two VIE JVs, and has 50% of the voting rights in each of the VIE JVs. Qualification as a VIE was based on the
determination that the equity investments at risk for each of these joint ventures were not sufficient based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis performed by the Company. The Company performed
a qualitative analysis for these joint ventures to determine which party was the primary beneficiary of each VIE. The Company determined that since the powers to direct the activities most significant
to the economic performance of these entities are shared equally by the Company and its joint venture partners, there is no primary beneficiary. Accordingly, these interests are recorded using the
equity method. 
        The
VIE JVs each own a single self-storage property. These joint ventures are financed through a combination of (1) equity contributions from the Company and its joint
venture partners, (2) mortgage notes payable and (3) payables to the Company. The payables to the Company consist of amounts owed for expenses paid on behalf of the joint ventures by the
Company as manager and mortgage notes payable to the Company. The Company performs management services for the VIE JVs in exchange for a management fee of approximately 6% of cash collected by the
properties. Except as disclosed, the Company has not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to the VIE JVs that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. 
        The
Company guarantees the mortgage notes payable of the VIE JVs. The Company's maximum exposure to loss for these joint ventures as of December 31, 2011, is the total of the
guaranteed loan balances, the payables due to the Company and the Company's investment balances in the joint ventures. The Company believes that the risk of incurring a material loss as a result of
having to perform on the loan guarantees is unlikely and, therefore, no liability has been recorded related to these guarantees. Also, repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facility
and land that collateralize the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company. Additionally, the Company believes the payables to the Company are collectible.

 8. DERIVATIVES  

        GAAP requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative
instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. A company must designate each qualifying hedging
instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operation. 
        The
Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps
are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed and variable-rate borrowings.

 9. NOTES PAYABLE TO TRUSTS  

        During July 2005, ESS Statutory Trust III (the "Trust III"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued an
aggregate of
$40,000 of preferred securities which mature on July 31, 2035. In addition, the Trust III issued 1,238 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of $1,238. On
July 27, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $41,238 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership ("Note 3"). Note 3 had a
fixed rate of 6.91% through July 31, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, the Trust III entered
into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at 4.99% per annum and matures July 11, 2018. The interest on Note 3, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust III
to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust III with no prepayment premium on July 27, 2010. 
        During
May 2005, ESS Statutory Trust II (the "Trust II"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the
Company, issued an aggregate of $41,000 of preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust II issued 1,269 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for
a purchase price of $1,269. On May 24, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $42,269 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership
("Note 2"). Note 2 had a fixed rate of 6.67% through June 30, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. Effective
July 11, 2011, the Trust II entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at 4.99% per annum and matures July 11, 2018. The interest on Note 2,
payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust II to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust II with no prepayment premium on
June 30, 2010. 
        During
April 2005, ESS Statutory Trust I (the "Trust"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company
issued an aggregate of $35,000 of trust preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust issued 1,083 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a
purchase price of $1,083. On April 8, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred and common securities of $36,083 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership
(the "Note"). The Note has a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. Effective June 30, 2010, the Trust entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest
rate to be paid at 5.62% per annum and matures on June 30, 2015. The interest on the Note, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust to pay

dividends
on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust with no prepayment premium on June 30, 2010. 
        Trust,
Trust II and Trust III are VIEs because the holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have the power to direct the activities of the
entities that most significantly affect the entities' economic performance because of their lack of voting or similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership's investment in the trusts' common
securities was financed directly by the trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered
to be an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership's investment in the trusts is not a variable interest because equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the
investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore the Operating Partnership cannot be the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, they
have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes as discussed above for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trust, Trust II, and Trust III by the Company. The
Company has also recorded its investment in the trusts' common securities as other assets. 
        The
Company has not provided financing or other support during the periods presented to the trusts that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. The Company's maximum
exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the trusts is equal to the total amount of the notes discussed above less the amounts of the Company's investments in the trusts' common
securities. The net amount is the notes payable that the trusts owe to third parties for their investments in the trusts' preferred securities. 
        Following
is a tabular comparison of the carrying amounts of the liabilities the Company has recorded as a result of its involvements with the trusts to the maximum exposure to loss the
Company is subject to related to the trusts as of December 31, 2011:

 10. EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES  

        On March 27, 2007, the Company's Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due April 1, 2027 (the "Notes"). Costs incurred to issue the
Notes were approximately $5,700. The remaining portion of these costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over five years, which represents the estimated term of the Notes, and
are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are
fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year until the maturity date of April 1,

2027.
The Notes bear interest at 3.625% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (up to the
principal amount of the Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock at an
exchange rate as of December 31, 2011, of approximately 43.1091 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes at the option of the Operating Partnership. 
        The
Operating Partnership may redeem the Notes at any time to preserve the Company's status as a REIT. In addition, on or after April 5, 2012, the Operating Partnership may redeem
the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice to holders
of the Notes. 
        The
holders of the Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on each of April 1, 2012, April 1, 2017
and April 1, 2022, and upon the occurrence of a designated event, in each case for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered "Events of Default," as defined in the indenture governing the Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity
of the Notes. 
        GAAP
requires entities with convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components
of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The Company, therefore, accounts for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately. The equity component
is included in paid-in-capital in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for
purposes of accounting for the debt component. The discount is being amortized over the period of the debt as additional interest expense. 
        Information
about the carrying amounts of the equity component, the principal amount of the liability component, its unamortized discount, and its net carrying amount are as follows:

 Repurchases of Notes  
        The Company has repurchased a portion of its Notes. The Company allocated the value of the consideration paid to repurchase the
Notes (1) to the extinguishment of the liability component and (2) to the reacquisition of the equity component. The amount allocated to the extinguishment of the liability component is
equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to extinguishment. The difference between the consideration attributed to the extinguishment of the liability component and the sum of
(a) the net carrying amount of the repurchased liability
component, and (b) the related unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as a gain on debt extinguishment. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the
equity component of the repurchased Notes and recognized as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

in the lease obligation liability is approximately $1,747 and $1,865 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to minimum rentals to be
received in the future under non cancelable subleases. The lease obligation liability increased by $2,000 during the year ended December 31, 2010, as a result of the bankruptcy of a tenant
subleasing office space from the Company in Memphis, TN. The Memphis, TN office lease is a liability assumed in the Storage USA acquisition in July 2005. The increase in this liability was recognized
through a $2,000 charge which is included as loss on sublease in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.

        During
2011, it was discovered that the asset management fee owed to the Company by the SPI joint venture had not been recorded by either party for the five-year period ended
December 31, 2010. The annual asset management fee for this period was $885, offset by an annual reduction of $221 of equity in earnings of SPI. Therefore, the Company's net income was
understated by $664 for each year in the five-year period ended December 31, 2010. After determining that the amounts were not material either in the prior periods or the current
year for restatement purposes, the Company recorded the asset management fee adjustments for the years 2006 through 2010 in the current year. The total prior period adjustment increased asset
management fee revenues by $4,425, and decreased equity in earnings by $1,106. Additionally, the Company recorded a receivable of $5,327 which represents the asset management fee owed for 2006 through
2011. The Company expects this receivable to be fully paid by the end of 2012.

        Other
receivables from properties consist of amounts due for management fees, asset management fees and expenses paid on behalf of the properties that the Company manages. The Company
believes that all of these related party and affiliated real estate joint venture receivables are fully collectible. The Company does not have any payables to related parties at December 31,
2011 and 2010. 
        In
January 2009, the Company purchased a lender's interest in a construction loan from a joint venture that owns a single property located in Sacramento, CA. The construction loan was to
ESS of Sacramento One, LLC, a joint venture in which the Company owns a 50% interest, and was guaranteed by the Company. In July 2009, the Company purchased a lender's interest in a mortgage
note from a joint venture that owns a single property located in Chicago, IL. The note was to Extra Space of Montrose, a joint venture in which the Company holds a 39% interest, and was also
guaranteed by the Company. Both ESS of Sacramento One, LLC and Extra Space of Montrose were consolidated as of December 31, 2009, as each joint venture was considered to be a VIE of
which the Company was the primary beneficiary. The construction loan and mortgage note receivable were eliminated by the Company in consolidation as of December 31, 2009. On January 1,
2010, the Company adopted changes to the accounting guidance in ASC 810, "Consolidation." As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the Company
determined that these joint ventures should no longer be consolidated as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these entities' economic performance is shared equally by the
Company and their joint venture partners, and therefore there is no primary beneficiary of either joint venture. The Company therefore deconsolidated these joint ventures as of January 1, 2010,
and removed the associated assets and liabilities from its books. The $2,251 note receivable from Extra Space of Montrose and the $5,002 loan receivable from ESS of Sacramento One, LLC are no
longer eliminated in consolidation as the Company now accounts for its interest in these joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. 
        Centershift,
a related party service provider, is partially owned by a certain director and certain members of management of the Company. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company
entered into a license agreement with Centershift which secures a perpetual right for continued use of STORE (the site management software used at all sites operated by the Company) in all aspects of
the Company's property acquisition, development, redevelopment and operational activities. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company paid Centershift $1,087, $778,
and $1,081, respectively, relating to the purchase of software and to license agreements.

        The
Company has entered into an aircraft dry lease and service and management agreement with SpenAero, L.C. ("SpenAero"), an affiliate of Spencer F. Kirk, the Company's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays a defined hourly rate for use of the aircraft. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company
paid SpenAero $608, $668, and $631, respectively. The services that the Company receives from SpenAero are similar in nature and price to those that are provided to other outside third parties. 
 14. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  

        The Company's charter provides that it can issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.
As of December 31, 2011, 94,783,590 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding. 
        All
holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to receive dividends and to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The transfer agent and registrar for the
Company's common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. 
        In
May 2011, the Company closed a public stock offering of 5,335,423 shares of its common stock at an offering price of $21.16 per share. The Company received gross proceeds of $112,898.
Transaction costs were $549, for net proceeds of $112,349. 
 15. NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS  

        On June 15, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement with various limited partnerships affiliated with AAAAA Rent-A-Space to
acquire ten self-storage facilities (the "Properties") in exchange for 989,980 Preferred OP units of the Operating Partnership. The self-storage facilities are located in
California and Hawaii. 
        On
June 25, 2007, the Company loaned the holder of the Preferred OP units $100,000. The note receivable bears interest at 4.85%, and is due September 1, 2017. The loan is
secured by the borrower's Preferred OP units. The holder of the Preferred OP units can convert up to 114,500 Preferred OP units prior to the maturity date of the loan. If any redemption in excess of
114,500 Preferred OP units occurs prior to the maturity date, the holder of the Preferred OP units is required to repay the loan as of the date of that Preferred OP unit redemption. Preferred OP units
are shown on the balance sheet net of the $100,000 loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Preferred OP units. 
        The
Operating Partnership entered into a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement") which provides for the designation and issuance of the
Preferred OP units. The Preferred OP units will have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

 15. NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS (Continued) 
        Under
the Partnership Agreement, Preferred OP units in the amount of $115,000 bear a fixed priority return of 5% and have a fixed liquidation value of $115,000. The remaining balance
will participate in distributions with and have a liquidation value equal to that of the common Operating Partnership units. The Preferred OP units became redeemable at the option of the holder on
September 1, 2008, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company's option, in cash or shares of common stock. 
        GAAP
requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but
separate from the company's equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the
face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be
redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. 
        The
Company has evaluated the terms of the Preferred OP units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the Preferred OP units as stockholders' equity in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the
consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying
amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made. 
 16. NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP  

        The Company's interest in its properties is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of
the Operating Partnership. ESS Business Trust II, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner
interests, the Company held a 95.9% majority ownership interest therein as of December 31, 2011. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including Preferred OP units) of
4.1% are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2011, the Operating Partnership had 3,049,935 common OP units outstanding. 
        The
noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the formation of the Company and as a result of
subsequent acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in properties to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units in the form of OP units. Limited partners who
received OP units in the formation transactions or in exchange for contributions for interests in properties have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP units
for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (10 day average) at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its
option, elect to acquire those OP units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to

adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. The ten day average closing stock price at December 31, 2011, was $24.01 and there were 3,049,935 OP units
outstanding. Assuming that all of the unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP units on December 31, 2011 and the Company elected to pay the non-controlling
members cash, the Company would have paid $73,229 in cash consideration to redeem the units. 
        In
January 2011, 150,000 OP units were redeemed in exchange for the Company's common stock. During April 2011, 143,641 OP units were redeemed in exchange for the Company's common stock
and 13,387 OP units were redeemed for $271 in cash. 
        During
July 2010, 90,135 OP units were redeemed for $1,314 in cash. During August 2010, 180,270 OP units were redeemed for $2,802 in cash. 
        In
December 2009, a member of management redeemed 72,643 OP units in exchange for the Company's common stock. This member of management no longer held any OP units after this redemption. 
        In
November 2009, a director redeemed 217,930 OP units in exchange for the Company's common stock. The director no longer held any OP units after this redemption. 
        During
April 2009, 114,928 OP units were redeemed in exchange for the Company's common stock. During July 2009, 232,099 OP units were redeemed in exchange for $1,908 in cash. 
        GAAP
requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but

        The
Company has evaluated the terms of the common OP units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the common OP units as stockholders' equity in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the
consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying
amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made. 
 17. OTHER NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  

        Other noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests of various third parties in three consolidated self-storage properties as of December 31, 2011. Two of
these consolidated properties were undeveloped, and one was in the lease-up stage as of December 31, 2011. The ownership interests of the third party owners range from 10.0% to
27.6%. Other noncontrolling interests are included in the stockholders' equity section of the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The income or losses

        In
October 2010, the Company paid $500 to obtain its joint venture partners' equity interests in three joint ventures: Extra Space of Franklin Blvd. LLC, Extra Space of Washington
Avenue LLC and Extra Space of Elk Grove LLC. Each of these joint ventures owned a single pre-stabilized property. These properties are now wholly-owned by the Company. 
        On
June 25, 2010, the Company acquired all of its minority partners' membership interests in two consolidated self-storage properties located in New Jersey for a total
of $50 in cash. These properties are now wholly-owned by the Company. 
        In
April 2009, the Company requested a capital contribution from its partners in Westport Ewing LLC, a consolidated joint venture, in order to reduce the joint venture's loan with
its current lender. The partners were unable to provide their pro rata share of the funds required to satisfy the lender and deeded their interest in Westport Ewing LLC to the Company on
June 1, 2009. As a result, the property held by this joint venture became a wholly-owned property of the Company. The Company recorded a loss of $800 related to the reassessment of the fair
value of the property. 
 18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

        The Company has the following plans under which shares were available for grant at December 31, 2011:


The 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan as amended and restated, effective March 25, 2008, and  
The 2004 Non-Employee Directors' Share Plan (together, the "Plans"). 

        Option
grants are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of stock on the date of grant. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance
Committee ("CNG Committee") at the time of grant, options shall vest ratably over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Each option will be exercisable once it has vested.
Options are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the CNG Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would cause a violation of the
ownership limit in the Company's charter. Options expire 10 years from the date of grant. 
        Also
as defined under the terms of the Plans, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are subject to a vesting period over which the restrictions are released and the
stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the performance or vesting period, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted stock granted
under the Plans; however, the grantee has the ability to vote the shares and receive nonforfeitable dividends paid on shares. Unless otherwise determined by the CNG Committee at the time of grant, the
forfeiture and transfer restrictions on the shares lapse over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. 
        As
of December 31, 2011, 2,786,113 shares were available for issuance under the Plans.

        The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2011 and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
December 31, 2011. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company's stock. 
        The
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $5.39, $3.27, and $1.31, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

        The

for the estimated life of the option. The Company uses actual historical data to calculate the expected price volatility, dividend yield

average expected term. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted-average of 17.4% of unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2011, is adjusted periodically based on the

        The
Company recorded compensation expense relating to outstanding options of $942, $801, and $831, in general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively. Total cash received for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, related to option exercises was $18,622, $5,661, and $0, respectively. At
December 31, 2011, there was $722 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive
Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.59 years. The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions that
could potentially change over time, including the expected forfeiture rate. Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at December 31, 2011, noted above does not necessarily
represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the statement of operations. 
 Common Stock Granted to Employees and Directors  
        The Company recorded $4,815, $3,779, and $2,978 of expense in general and administrative expense in its statement of operations related
to outstanding shares of common stock granted to employees and directors for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a
weighted-average of 7% of unvested awards outstanding as of December 31, 2011, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from
the previous estimates. At December 31, 2011, there was $5,117 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards under the Company's 2004
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.99 years. 
        The
fair value of common stock awards is determined based on the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.

 19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN  

        The Company has a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code under which eligible employees can contribute up to 15% of their annual salary, subject
to a statutory prescribed annual limit. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made matching contributions to the plan of $832, $805, and $755, respectively, based on
100% of the first 3% and up to 50% of the next 2% of an employee's compensation. 
 20. INCOME TAXES  

        As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which is distributed annually to its stockholders. However, the Company
has elected to treat one of its corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary. In general, the Company's TRS may perform additional services for tenants and
generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any
person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

 22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  

        If the joint ventures default on the loans, the Company may be forced to repay the loans. Repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facilities and land that collateralize
the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company. The Company has recorded no liability in relation to these guarantees as of December 31, 2011, as the fair value of the
guarantees is not material. The Company believes the risk of incurring a material loss as a result of having to perform on these guarantees is remote. 
        The
Company has been involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As a result of these litigation matters, the Company has recorded a liability of $1,800,
which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not believe it to be reasonably possible that the loss related to these litigation matters will be in excess
of the current amount accrued. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was not involved in any material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against it which, in
the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

    Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure     
        None.  
 
    Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures     
(i)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition
of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance,
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
        We
have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The
disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
103



 
Table of Contents
        We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
(ii)   Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
(a)   Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        Our
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued the following attestation report over our internal control over financial reporting. 
(b)   Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm  
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.  
        We have audited Extra Space Storage Inc.'s (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Extra Space
Storage Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. 
        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the 
104



 
Table of Contents
maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011,
and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Extra Space
Storage Inc. and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(c)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
        There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred
during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
