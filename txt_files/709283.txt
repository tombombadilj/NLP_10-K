ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Business Description 
Quantum Corporation (Quantum, the
Company, us or we), founded in 1980, is a global expert in data protection
and big data management. We provide solutions for storing and protecting
information in physical, virtual, cloud and big data environments that are
designed to help customers be certain they are maximizing the value of their
data over its entire lifecycle. With our solutions, customers can better adapt
in a world of continuing change by keeping and protecting more data for a longer
period of time while reducing costs and increasing return on investment. We work closely
with a broad network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), direct
marketing resellers (DMRs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and
other suppliers to meet customers evolving data protection and big data
management needs. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol QTM.
Our data protection solutions include
DXi® deduplication systems and Scalar® automated tape
libraries that optimize backup and recovery, simplify management and lower cost
and our vmPROTM virtual server backup and disaster recovery offerings
that protect virtual environments while minimizing the impact to servers and
storage. For big data environments, we provide StorNext® tiered

1


In recent years we have transformed
Quantum through acquisitions and organic growth into a systems and solutions
company. Our strategy is to grow the independent channel for Quantum branded
solutions by offering products with superior performance and value. We plan to
continue to expand and improve our product and solution offerings, with emphasis
on branded disk systems, software solutions, virtual offerings and cloud
solutions.
Industry Background 
Information Technology (IT) departments
face an environment of change. There is increasing focus on the economics of
data as these departments not only address continued data growth but also
identify solutions to store more data for longer periods of time as data becomes
more valuable. With new ways to analyze and reuse data for additional revenue
streams, new ideas and operational breakthroughs, IT managers are looking to
ensure the organization can take full advantage of the information and knowledge
from that data. For these reasons, data protection and big data management are
important to businesses and organizations and consistently are reflected as top
priorities in end user research studies. 
Another change that has occurred over the
last several years is the emergence of new architectures and technologies that
reduce costs and increase efficiency. These include data deduplication,
scale-out storage, virtualization and cloud storage. The challenge is that these
technologies can also introduce disruption for IT, so it takes careful planning
and smart solutions to enable organizations to move forward. 
In the face of these changes, IT
departments also confront continued constraints. Resources and budgets remain
tight, which is one of the main reasons reducing data acquisition costs and
ongoing operational costs is a top priority. In addition, even as they look to
capitalize on new technologies and solutions, many IT managers still have to
support legacy environments and applications. Finally, there is often built-in
inertia or risk aversion when it comes to changing architectures or existing
vendors. As a result, there is significant opportunity for storage specialists
such as Quantum to assist organizations through transition.
Products 
Big Data Management and
Archive 
With new digital technologies creating
larger data files that can generate greater business value, there is a growing
need to retain data for progressively longer periods while maintaining
visibility and access to it. IT departments are increasingly focused on managing
this big data. Generally, big data refers to relatively new data types that
produce large files, often measured in petabytes, such as video, imaging and
audio. Big data also refers to large collections of small data, such as retail
purchasing information, underwater photos of the ocean floor and feeds from
traffic cameras that when combined, create meaning and increasingly, competitive
advantage. In addition, in managing big data, organizations are increasingly
recognizing that they need efficient and cost-effective ways to archive it. We
offer StorNext software and appliance-based solutions to address this growing
need for managing and archiving big data.
StorNext Software 
Designed for data-intensive environments,
our StorNext software reduces the time and total cost of managing data for end
users with large data sets and challenging distributed environments. The
StorNext File System software provides high-performance shared access to data
across different networks, operating systems and storage platforms. In addition,
our StorNext Storage ManagerTM software automatically copies and
migrates data between different tiers of storage based on user-defined policies.
The result is a highly scalable, high-performance data management solution
designed to optimize the use of storage while enabling the long-term protection
and recoverability of data. 
Our StorNext software helps businesses
with big data to benefit from workflow efficiencies, automated tiered storage
and policy-based archive management. Designed for open system data-intensive
environments, StorNext software products allow multiple users to rapidly access
a single data set, increasing productivity and storage utilization. They also
transparently move data, reducing storage costs while simultaneously providing
embedded data protection. For several years, organizations within rich media
production and broadcasting, the federal government, life sciences and other
disciplines have utilized our data management software to derive more value from
their data while controlling costs. Many of these customers now rely on our
software as a key technology enabler for their business processes and workflow.

StorNext Appliances
Our StorNext appliances leverage the power
of StorNext software and market-leading hardware to offer predictable
high-performance file sharing and archiving in purpose-built configurations of
metadata controllers, expansion appliances and disk, and archive enabled
libraries. They are simple to deploy and architected to deliver scalable,
industry-leading performance, drive lower operational costs and provide a
flexible open system for enabling third party applications. These appliances
also work seamlessly with traditional StorNext software and partner hardware
offerings to provide additional options for building a shared storage area
network (SAN) and scale out network-attached storage (NAS) environment. They
are intended to serve a wide range of markets, such as film editing, seismic
processing or genome sequencing and balance the highest performance with the
lowest long-term cost for sharing big data files in data intensive operations.

Data Protection 
DXi Disk Systems
Our DXi disk-based backup systems meet the
needs of a broad range of customers, from small businesses and remote offices to
large distributed enterprise data center environments, seeking high speed
recovery and extreme reliability beyond what a tape-only environment can
deliver. These solutions offer functionality normally reserved for enterprise
class data centers, such as data deduplication, virtual tape, snapshot, data
recovery and replication capabilities. Our disk-based backup appliances are
designed for easy implementation and integration into existing environments and
provide industry-leading performance, capacity and price-performance.

Our DXi disk systems use deduplication
technology to expand the amount of backup data users can retain on traditional
disk systems. The result is a cost-effective means for IT departments to store
backup data on disk for months instead of days, providing high-speed restores,
increasing available data recovery points and reducing media management. For
disaster recovery in distributed environments, the DXi-SeriesTM also
makes wide area network (WAN) replication practical because of the greatly
reduced bandwidth required with data deduplication. By greatly increasing
effective disk capacity, data deduplication enables users to retain backup data
on fast recovery disk much longer than possible using conventional disk and
significantly reduces the bandwidth needed to move data between sites. We hold a
key patent in one of the most efficient methods of data deduplication, known as
variable-length data deduplication.
Our DXi-Series systems provide a
combination of high performance and advanced functionality. In addition to data
deduplication, the core set of advanced features of the DXi-Series includes a
high performance embedded file system, support for high speed data compression,
asynchronous replication, direct tape creation and built-in monitoring and
diagnostic tools.
vmPRO For Virtual
Environments 
Our virtual environment offerings include
vmPRO software and vmPRO appliances. Our vmPRO software provides virtualization
data protection software with advanced utilities designed to dramatically
improve and simplify virtual data protection in midrange and larger data
centers. It works with our DXi family of deduplication products to accelerate
backup, restore and disaster recovery protection in data center virtual
environments while reducing IT costs. We also offer vmPRO appliances that
provide an integrated data protection solution designed to simplify backups in
virtual environments. These appliances include both backup software and
integrated storage with deduplication in a single solution for small to
medium-size businesses and remote offices. The vmPRO appliances optimize virtual
machines and accelerate performance by filtering out unassigned, expired and
inactive data to reduce overhead on servers, networks and storage. 
Scalar Tape Automation Systems

We are the leading named supplier of tape
automation shipments and we continue to expand features and capabilities of our
tape library offerings to increase storage capacity and improve performance. Our
Scalar tape automation portfolio includes a range of products, from autoloaders
with one tape drive and up to sixteen cartridges to large enterprise-class
libraries which can hold hundreds of drives and thousands of cartridges. Our
tape libraries intelligently manage and protect business critical data in
workgroup, medium size business and enterprise data center environments. With an
emphasis on ease of use, management features and investment optimization, Scalar
tape libraries are designed to grow with business needs. These products
integrate tape drives into a system with automation technology, advanced
connectivity and sophisticated management tools,
including integrated media integrity analysis in tape drives and library
diagnostic systems. We also offer the SuperLoader®3 autoloader
designed to maximize data density and performance.
3


Tying our libraries together from
entry-level to enterprise is a common, integrated software called
iLayerTM, which provides monitoring, alerts and proactive
diagnostics, thereby reducing service calls, shortening issue resolution time
and decreasing the time users spend managing their tape automation solutions. In
addition, we believe the growth in archiving of unstructured data represents a
substantial opportunity for tape automation systems. To capitalize on this trend
and the changing role of tape automation systems in data protection, we have
invested in our enterprise Scalar i6000 and midrange Scalar i500 platforms to
provide increased redundancy capabilities. These platforms can be implemented on
their own or in an appliance configuration with our StorNext archiving
software.
Devices and Media 
Our device and media products include
removable disk drives and libraries, NAS appliances and tape drives and media.
Our RDX® removable and ruggedized disk backup devices combine
attributes of disk and tape, with deduplication technology offered in our RDX
disk libraries. Our NAS appliance has built-in backup software and deduplication
technology, designed to enable businesses to significantly reduce storage
requirements and network traffic. 
We offer tape drives and media based on
the LTO format. The latest generation LTO tape drive technology is capable of
storing nearly twice the capacity of the previous generation, while consuming
less power. Our LTO family of devices is designed to deliver outstanding
performance, capacity and reliability, combining the advantages of linear
multi-channel, bidirectional formats with enhancements in servo technology, data
compression, track layout and error correction. These LTO tape drives are
designed to provide midrange and enterprise customers with disaster recovery and
cost-effective backup solutions.
We also sell a full range of storage media
offerings to complement each tape drive technology and satisfy a variety of
specific media requirements. Our media includes DLTtape®, LTO
Ultrium®, DAT and DDS data cartridges. Our media is compatible with
our drives, autoloaders and libraries as well as other industry products.

Cloud Solutions
We offer a software platform to help
customers take advantage of cloud-based data protection through a highly
optimized, flexible approach designed to overcome the limitations of other cloud
offerings. This platform is centered on our vmPRO technology and our virtual
deduplication appliance, the DXi V1000TM. Our cloud-based data
protection platform leverages our expertise in data protection to deliver a
highly efficient, cost-effective foundation for cloud-based backup, restore and
data recovery that helps customers transition easily and practically to the
cloud on their terms and timeframe. Our approach is based on knowledge that most
customers continue to use both disk and tape for data protection on a mix of
physical and virtual servers and are more comfortable with a hybrid cloud
strategy. This focus on flexibility is reflected in the benefits provided by our
cloud-optimized software platform, including fast restores; cost-effective
disaster recovery and business continuity; secure, multi-tenant cloud support;
significant data reduction and WAN-optimized replication.
Global Services and
Warranty
Our global services strategy is an
integral component of our total customer solution. Service is typically a
significant purchase factor for customers considering either big data management
or data protection and storage solutions, and our ability to provide
comprehensive service and support can present us with a noteworthy competitive
advantage to attract new customers and retain existing customers. In addition,
we believe that our ability to retain long-term customer relationships and
secure repeat business is frequently tied directly to our service capabilities
and performance. 
Our extensive use of technology and
innovative, built-in product intelligence allows us to scale our global services
operations to meet the needs of our expanding installed base. We are currently
able to provide service to customers in more than 100 countries, supported by
24-hour, multi-language technical support centers located in North America,
Europe and Asia. We provide our customers with warranty coverage on all of our
products. Customers with high availability requirements may also purchase
additional service to extend the warranty period, obtain faster response times,
or both, on our disk systems, tape automation and software products. We offer
this additional support coverage at a variety of response levels up to 24-hours
a day, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year, for customers with stringent
high-availability needs. We provide support ranging from repair and replacement
to 24-hour rapid exchange to on-site service support for our midrange and
enterprise-class products. 
4


We generally warrant our hardware products
against defects for periods ranging from one to three years from the date of
sale. We provide warranty and non-warranty services from our Colorado Springs,
Colorado facility and, for certain products, through third party service
providers. In addition, we utilize various other third party service providers
throughout the world to perform repair and warranty services for us to reach
additional geographic areas and industries in order to provide quality services
in a cost-effective manner.
Research and Development

We compete in an industry characterized by
rapid technological change and evolving customer requirements. Our success
depends, in part, on our ability to introduce new products and features to meet
end user needs. Our research and development teams are working on the next
generation disk, tape automation, data deduplication, virtual systems, cloud
solutions and big data technologies as well as software solutions to advance
these technologies for the big data and archive and the data protection markets
to meet changing customer requirements. We continue to focus our efforts on
software solutions and integrated software and hardware solutions that offer
improvements in the efficiency and cost of storing, moving, managing and
protecting large amounts of data and closely integrating our products to provide
compelling solutions for our customers.
We continue to invest in research and
development to improve and expand our product lines and introduce new product
lines, striving to provide superior data protection, including cloud
environments, and big data and archive solutions. Research and development costs
were $74.3 million, $73.0 million and $69.9 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. 
Sales and Distribution
Channels
Quantum
Branded Sales Channels 
For Quantum-branded products, we utilize
distributors, VARs and direct marketing resellers. Our integrated Quantum
Alliance Reseller Program provides our channel partners the option of
purchasing products directly or through distribution and provides them access to
a more comprehensive product line. Additionally, we sell directly to a select
number of large corporate entities and government agencies. 
OEM Relationships 
We sell our products to several OEM
customers that resell our hardware products under their own brand names and
typically assume responsibility for product sales, end user service and support.
We also license software to certain OEM customers that include this software in
their own brand name products. These OEM relationships enable us to reach end
users not served by our branded distribution channels or our direct sales force.
They also allow us to sell to select geographic or vertical markets where
specific OEMs have exceptional strength.
Customers 
Our sales are concentrated with several
key customers because under our business model, as is typical for our industry,
we sell to OEMs, distributors, VARs and DMRs to reach end user customers. Sales
to our top five customers represented 34% of revenue in fiscal 2012, 33% of
revenue in fiscal 2011 and 37% of revenue in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011 and
fiscal 2010, sales to Dell comprised 10% and 13% of revenue, respectively.
Through our Quantum Alliance Reseller Program and our emphasis on growing our
branded business, including increasing the independent channel, we are expanding
our customer base and continue to distribute our products and services across a
larger number of customers.

Competition 
The markets in which we participate are
highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change and changing
customer requirements. In some cases, our competitors in one market area are
customers or suppliers in another. Our competitors often have greater financial,
technical, manufacturing, marketing or other resources than we do. Additionally,
the competitive landscape continues to change due to merger and acquisition
activity as well as new entrants into the market.
Our StorNext software and appliance
products primarily face competition from EMC Corporation (EMC) and
International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM). Our virtual solutions, vmPRO software and appliances, primarily compete
with virtualization startups and traditional backup application vendors. Our cloud solutions
face competition from a large number of businesses that provide hardware,
software and virtual solutions as well as companies that offer cloud services
based on other technology. 
Our disk solutions primarily compete with
products sold by EMC, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), IBM and NetApp, Inc.
(NetApp). Additionally, a number of software companies that have traditionally
been partners with us have deduplication features in their products and will, at
times, compete with us. A number of our competitors also license technology from
other competing companies.
In the tape automation market, we
primarily compete for midrange and enterprise reseller and end user business
with Dell, IBM and Oracle as well as HP through its OEM relationship with other
tape automation suppliers. Competitors for entry-level and OEM tape automation
business include BDT Products, Inc. and several others that supply or
manufacture similar products. In addition, disk backup products are a
competitive alternative to tape products and solutions. 
At the storage device level, our main
competitors are HP and IBM. Both HP and IBM develop and sell their own LTO tape
drives, which compete with our device offerings. We also face competition from
disk alternatives, including removable disk drives in the entry-level market.
Although we have our own removable disk drive offerings, several other companies
sell removable disk drives, such as Dell, HP and Imation Corporation.

For a discussion of risks associated with
competing technologies, see the Risk Factor in Item 1A titled, We derive the
majority of our revenue from products incorporating tape technology. If
competition from new or alternative storage technologies continues or increases,
our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and
adversely affected. 
Manufacturing 
We utilize contract manufacturers to
produce a number of our products and we manufacture various other products in
our own facilities. We manufacture our disk products, vmPRO appliances, StorNext
appliances and certain tape automation systems and perform device and system
configuration for our North American customers from our Colorado Springs,
Colorado facility. In addition, we perform test and repair for these products in
that same facility. 
We outsource the manufacture of certain
tape automation systems, tape devices and service parts from contract
manufacturers. Tape drives used in our products are primarily sourced from
Hungary and Malaysia. Disk drives used in our products are largely sourced from
Thailand and China. Certain tape automation system materials and assemblies as
well as certain disk system materials and assemblies are sourced in China,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the U.S. 
Our recording tape media is manufactured
by one or more tape media manufacturing companies, which are qualified and
licensed to manufacture, use and sell media products. In most cases, the media
is produced in Japan and multi-sourced on a worldwide basis. 
Technology 
We develop and protect our technology and
know-how, principally in the field of data storage. As of March 31, 2012, we
hold over 400 U.S. patents and have nearly 100 pending U.S. patent applications.
In general, these patents have a 20-year term from the first effective filing
date for each patent. We also hold a number of foreign patents and patent
applications for certain of our products and technologies. Although we believe
that our patents and applications have significant value, rapidly changing
technology in our industry means that our future success will also depend
heavily on the technical competence and creative skills of our employees.

6


From time to time, third parties have
asserted that the manufacture and sale of our products have infringed on their
patents. We conduct ongoing investigations into the assertions and presently
believe that either licenses are not required or that any licenses ultimately
determined to be required could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
However, we cannot provide assurance that such licenses are presently
obtainable, or if later determined to be required, could be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings for additional
disclosures regarding an on-going lawsuit alleging patent
infringement.
On occasion, we have entered into various
patent licensing and cross-licensing agreements with other companies. We may
enter into patent cross-licensing agreements with other third parties in the
future as part of our normal business activities. These agreements, when and if
entered into, would enable these third parties to use certain patents that we
own and enable us to use certain patents owned by these third parties. We have
also sold certain patents, retaining a royalty-free license for these
patents.
Seasonality 
As is typical in our industry, we have the
greatest demand for our products and services in the fourth quarter of each
calendar year, or our fiscal third quarter. We usually experience the lowest
demand for our products and services in the first and second quarters of each
calendar year, or our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal first quarter,
respectively.
Backlog

We manufacture our products based on
forecasts of customer demand. We also place inventory in strategic locations in
order to enable certain key customers to obtain products on demand. Orders are
generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. Product orders are
confirmed and, in most cases, shipped to customers within one week. More complex
systems and product configurations often have longer lead times and may include
on-site integration or customer acceptance. We ship most of the backlog that we
accumulate during any particular fiscal quarter in the same quarter in which the
backlog initially occurs. Therefore, our backlog generally grows during each
fiscal quarter and shrinks during the latter part of the quarter to reach its
lowest levels at the end of that same quarter, by which time significant
shipments have occurred. As a result, our backlog as of the end of any fiscal
quarter is not material and is not a predictor of future sales.
Employees 
We had approximately 1,820 employees

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS
DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING QUANTUM.
ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT ARE
CURRENTLY DEEMED IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. PLEASE SEE
PAGE 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THESE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS.
We rely on indirect sales channels to
market and sell our branded products. Therefore, the loss of or deterioration in
our relationship with one or more of our resellers or distributors, or our
inability to establish new indirect sales channels to drive growth of our
branded revenue, especially for disk systems and software solutions, could
negatively affect our operating results. 
We sell the majority of our branded
products to value-added resellers, or VARs, and to direct marketing resellers
such as CDW Corporation, who in turn sell our products to end users, and to
distributors such as Avnet, Inc., Ingram Micro, Inc. and others. The success of
these sales channels is hard to predict, particularly over time, and we have no
purchase commitments or long-term orders from them that assure us of any
baseline sales through these channels. Several of our resellers carry competing
product lines that they may promote over our products. A reseller might not
continue to purchase our products or market them effectively, and each reseller
determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and
the pricing of the products that it sells to end user customers. Establishing
new indirect sales channels is an important part of our strategy to drive growth
of our branded revenue.
As we introduce new products and
solutions, we could negatively impact our relationship with channel partners
that historically have sold other products and solutions that now compete with
our new offerings. For example, we introduced various StorNext appliance
solutions in fiscal 2012 causing us to more directly compete for hardware sales
with channel partners that sold other hardware products in conjunction with our
StorNext software. 
9


Certain of our contracts with customers
contain most favored nation pricing provisions mandating that we offer our
products to these customers at the lowest price offered to other similarly
situated customers. In addition, sales of our enterprise products, and the
revenue associated with the on-site service of those products, are somewhat
concentrated in specific customers, including government agencies and
government-related companies. Our operating results could be adversely affected
by any number of factors including:
A change in competitive strategy that adversely
  affects a resellers willingness or ability to distribute our products;
The reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or
  the return of a significant amount of products;
Our inability to gain traction in developing new
  indirect sales channels for our branded products;
The loss of one or more of such distributors or
  resellers;
Any financial difficulties of such distributors or
  resellers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us; or
Changes in requirements or programs that allow our
  products to be sold by third parties to government customers. 
Our operating results depend on a
limited number of products and on new product introductions, which may not be
successful, in which case our business, financial condition and operating
results may be materially and adversely affected. 
A limited number of products comprise a
significant majority of our sales, and due to rapid technological change in the
industry, our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and
successfully introduce new products. To compete effectively, we must continually
improve existing products and introduce new ones. We have devoted and expect to
continue to devote considerable management and financial resources to these
efforts. We cannot provide assurance that: 
We will introduce new products in the timeframe we
  are forecasting;
We will not experience technical, quality,
  performance-related or other difficulties that could prevent or delay
  the introduction and market acceptance of new
  products;
Our new products will achieve market acceptance
  and significant market share, or that the markets for these products will continue or grow as we have
  anticipated;
Our new products will be successfully or timely
  qualified with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications which must occur before customers
  will place large product orders; or
We will achieve high volume production of these
  new products in a timely manner, if at all. 
If we are not successful in timely
completion of our new product qualifications and then ramping sales to our key
customers, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In
addition, if the quality of our products is not acceptable to our customers,
this could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue and increased
warranty and repair costs. 
Competition may intensify in the data
protection market as a result of competitors introducing products based on new
technology standards and merger and acquisition activity, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 
Our competitors in the data protection
market for disk systems and virtual machine solutions are aggressively trying to
advance and develop new technologies and products to compete against our
technologies and products, and we face the risk that customers could choose
competitor products over ours due to these features and technologies.
Competition in these markets is characterized by technological innovation and
advancement. As a result of competition and new technology standards, our sales
or gross margins could decline, which could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Technological developments and competition
over the years in the tape automation market has resulted in decreased prices
for tape automation products and product offerings. Pricing pressure is more
pronounced in the tape automation market for entry-level products and least
pronounced for enterprise products. Similar to our competitors, our products may
be priced lower and often incorporate new and/or different features and
technologies than prior years. We face risks that customers could choose
competitor products over ours due to these features and technologies or due to
pricing differences. We have managed pricing pressure by reducing production
costs and/or adding features to increase value to maintain a certain level of
gross margin for our tape automation systems. If competition further
intensifies, or if there is additional industry consolidation, our sales and
gross margins for tape automation systems could decline, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 
10


Industry consolidation and competing
technologies with device products, which include tape drives and removable hard
drives, have resulted in decreased prices and increasingly commoditized device
products. Our response has been to manage our device business at the material
margin level and we have chosen not to compete for sales in intense price-based
situations or if we would be unable to maintain a certain gross margin level.
Our focus has shifted to higher margin opportunities in other product lines.
Although revenue from devices has decreased in recent years, our material
margins have remained relatively stable over this period. We have exited certain
portions of the device market and have anticipated decreased sales of devices.
We face risk of reduced shipments of our devices beyond our plans, and could
have reduced margins on these products, which could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, the competitive landscape
could change due to merger and acquisition activity in the data protection
market. Such transactions may impact us in a number of ways. For instance, they
could result in: 

Smaller number of competitors having greater
  resources and becoming more competitive with us;
Companies that we have not historically competed
  against entering into one or more of our primary markets and increasing
  competition in that market(s); and 
Customers that are also competitors becoming more
  competitive with us and/or reducing their purchase of our products.

These transactions also create uncertainty
and disruption in the market, given that it is often unknown whether a pending
transaction will be completed, the timing of such a transaction, and its degree
of impact. Given these factors and others, such merger and acquisition activity
may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 
Competition may intensify in the big
data and archive market as a result of competitors introducing products based on
new technology standards and merger and acquisition activity, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Competition in the big data and archive
market is characterized by technological innovation and advancement, including
performance and scale features, and our competitors are aggressively trying to
advance and develop new technologies and solutions. We face the risk that
customers could choose competitor solutions over ours due to these features and
technologies. As a result of competition and new technology standards, our sales
from software solutions and appliances could decline, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Additionally, the competitive landscape
could change due to merger and acquisition activity, such as the acquisition of
Isilon Systems, Inc. by EMC. Transactions such as these may impact us in a
number of ways. For instance, they could result in: 
Smaller number of competitors having greater
  resources and becoming more competitive with us;
Companies that we have not historically competed
  against entering into one or more of our primary markets and increasing
  competition in that market(s); and 
Customers that are also competitors becoming more
  competitive with us and/or reducing their purchase of our products.

These transactions also create uncertainty
and disruption in the market, given that it is often unknown whether a pending
transaction will be completed, the timing of such a transaction, and its degree
of impact. Given these factors and others, such merger and acquisition activity
may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our royalties, branded software and OEM
deduplication software revenues are relatively profitable and can significantly
impact total company profitability. A significant decline in royalty, branded
software or OEM deduplication software revenues could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
We receive royalty revenue based on tape
media cartridges sold by various tape media manufacturers and resellers. Under
our license agreements with these companies, each of the licensees determines
the pricing and number of units of tape media cartridges that it sells. Our
royalty revenue varies depending on the level of sales of the various media
cartridge offerings sold by the licensees and other factors, including:

The size of the installed base of devices and
  similar products that use tape media cartridges;
The performance of our strategic licensing
  partners, which sell tape media cartridges;
The relative growth in units of newer device
  products, since the associated media cartridges for newer products
typically sell at higher prices than the media
  cartridges associated with older products;
The media consumption habits and rates of end
  users;
The pattern of device retirements; and
The level of channel inventories. 
Our media royalties depend on royalty
rates and the quantity of media consumed in the market. We do not control
licensee sales of these tape media cartridges. Reduced royalty rates, or a
reduced installed device base using tape media cartridges, would result in
further reductions in our royalty revenue and could reduce gross margins. This
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Our branded software revenues are also
dependent on many factors, including the success of competitive offerings, our
ability to execute on our product roadmap and our effectiveness at marketing and
selling our branded software solutions directly or through our channel partners.

Our OEM deduplication software revenues
also depend on many factors, including the success of competitive offerings, our
ability to execute on our product roadmap with our OEM deduplication software
partners, the effort of our OEM deduplication software partners in marketing and
selling the resulting products, the market acceptance of the resulting products
and changes in the competitive landscape such as that which occurred with EMCs
purchase of Data Domain. Our relationship with EMC changed from partner to
competitor in deduplication as a result of their acquisition of Data Domain.
Following this acquisition, except for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 when
significant revenue was recognized in accordance with contractual requirements,
our OEM deduplication software revenue has significantly declined, which has
negatively impacted our results. 
We derive the majority of our revenue
from products incorporating tape technology. If we are unable to compete with
new or alternative storage technologies, our business, financial condition and
operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 
We derive the majority of our revenue from
products that incorporate some form of tape technology and we expect to continue
to derive significant revenue from these products in the next several years. As
a result, our future operating results depend in part on continued market
acceptance and use of products employing tape technology. Disk products as well
as various software solutions and alternative technologies continue to gain
broader market acceptance. We face risks that our tape customers migrate toward
these products and solutions.
We are addressing this risk through our
own targeted investment in disk systems and other alternative technologies;
however, these markets are characterized by rapid innovation, evolving customer
demands and strong competition, including competition with several companies who
are also significant customers. If we are not successful in our efforts, our
business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and
adversely affected. 
A large percentage of our sales come
from a few customers, some of which are also competitors, and these customers
generally have no minimum or long-term purchase commitments. The loss of, or a
significant reduction in demand from, one or more key customers could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. 
Our sales have been and continue to be
concentrated among a few customers because under our business model, we sell to
OEMs, distributors, VARs and DMRs to reach end user customers. Furthermore,
customers are not obligated to purchase any minimum product volume and our
relationships with customers are terminable at will. Revenue from OEM customers
has decreased in recent years. If we experience further declines in revenue from
OEM customers or any of our other large customers, we could be materially and
adversely affected. In addition, certain of our large customers are also our
competitors, and such customers could decide to reduce or terminate their
purchases of our products for competitive reasons. 
12


Some of our tape and disk products are
incorporated into larger storage systems or solutions that are marketed and sold
to end users by our large OEM customers as well as our VARs, channel partners
and other distributors. Because of this, we have limited market access to these
end users, limiting our ability to reach and influence their purchasing
decisions. These market conditions further our reliance on these OEM and other
large customers such as distributors and VARs. Thus if they were to
significantly reduce, cancel or delay their orders with us, our results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
We continue to face risks related to
the slow economic recovery.
The economic crisis in the U.S. and global
financial markets in 2008 and 2009 had a material and adverse impact on our
business and our financial condition, including reduced demand for our products
and concerns about our ability to access capital markets. The initial impact of
this economic crisis was reflected in our results for the third quarter of
fiscal 2009. We continue to face risks related to the slow economic recovery,
including risks related to economic conditions in Europe. In addition, concerns
about the potential default of various national bonds and debt backed by
individual countries as well the politics impacting these, could negatively
impact the U.S. and global economies and adversely affect our financial results.
Uncertainty about economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may further
reduce or postpone spending in response to reduced budgets, tight credit,
negative financial news and declines in income or asset values which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted which could
have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business
conditions and could also adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.
If our products fail to meet our or our
customers specifications for quality and reliability, our results of operations
may be adversely impacted and our competitive position may
suffer. 
Although we place great emphasis on
product quality, we may from time to time experience problems with the
performance of our products, which could result in one or more of the following:

Increased costs related to fulfillment of our
  warranty obligations;
The reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or
  the return of a significant amount of products;
Focused failure analysis causing distraction of
  the sales, operations and management teams; or
The loss of reputation in the market and customer
  goodwill. 
These factors could cause our business,
financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely
affected. 
We have taken considerable steps
towards reducing our cost structure and may take further cost reduction actions.
The steps we have taken and may take in the future may not reduce our cost
structure to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales and therefore,
these anticipated cost reductions may be insufficient to result in consistent
profitability. 
In the last several years, we have
recorded significant restructuring charges and made cash payments in order to
reduce our cost of sales and operating expenses to rationalize our operations
following past acquisitions, to respond to adverse economic and industry
conditions and from strategic management decisions. We may take future steps to
further reduce our operating costs, including future cost reduction steps or
restructurings in response to strategic decisions, adverse changes in our
business or industry or future acquisitions. We may be unable to reduce our cost
of sales and operating expenses at a rate and to a level appropriate in relation
to our future sales, which may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and operating results.
If we are unable to attract and retain
skilled employees, our business could be adversely impacted. 
We may be subject to increased turnover in
our employee base or the inability to fill open headcount requisitions due to
competition, concerns about our operational performance or other factors. In
addition, we may rely on the performance of employees whose skill sets are not
sufficiently developed to completely realize the expected fulfillment of their
job responsibilities. Either of these situations could impair or delay our
ability to realize operational and strategic objectives and cause increased
expenses and lost sales opportunities. 
13


Economic or other business factors may
lead us to write down the carrying amount of our goodwill or long-lived assets,
such as the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2009, which could have a
material and adverse effect on our results of operations.
We evaluate our goodwill for impairment
annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently when
indicators of impairment are present. Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist. We
continue to monitor relevant market and economic conditions, including the price
of our stock, and perform appropriate impairment reviews when conditions
deteriorate such that we believe the value of our goodwill could be further
impaired or an impairment exists in our long-lived assets. It is possible that
conditions could deteriorate due to economic or other factors that affect our
business, resulting in the need to write down the carrying amount of our
goodwill or long-lived assets to fair value at the time of such assessment. As a
result, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.

Third party intellectual property
infringement claims could result in substantial liability and significant costs,
and, as a result, our business, financial condition and operating results may be
materially and adversely affected. 
From time to time, third parties allege
our infringement of and need for a license under their patented or other
proprietary technology, such as our current litigation with CTS Solutions
described in Item 3 below. While we currently believe the amount of ultimate
liability, if any, with respect to any such actions will not materially affect
our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome
of any license discussion or litigation is uncertain. Adverse resolution of any
third party infringement claim could subject us to substantial liabilities and
require us to refrain from manufacturing and selling certain products. In
addition, the costs incurred in intellectual property litigation can be
substantial, regardless of the outcome. As a result, our business, financial
condition and operating results could be materially and adversely
affected.
In addition, certain products or
technologies acquired or developed by us may include open source software.
Open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge. Certain
open source software licenses, however, require users of the open source
software to license to others any software that is based on, incorporates or
interacts with, the open source software under the terms of the open source
license. Although we endeavor to comply fully with such requirements, third
parties could claim that we are required to license larger portions of our
software than we believe we are required to license under open source software
licenses. If such claims were successful, they could adversely impact our
competitive position and financial results by providing our competitors with
access to sensitive information that may help them develop competitive products.
In addition, our use of open source software may harm our business and subject
us to intellectual property claims, litigation or proceedings in the future
because:
Open source license terms may be ambiguous and may
  subject us to unanticipated obligations regarding our products, technologies and intellectual property;
Open source software generally cannot be protected
  under trade secret law; and
It may be difficult for us to accurately determine
  the origin of the open source code and whether the open source software infringes, misappropriates or violates third party
  intellectual property or other rights. 
As a result of our global manufacturing
and sales operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to
businesses with international operations of a similar scope, any of which could,
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business.

A significant portion of our manufacturing
and sales operations and supply chain occurs in countries other than the U.S. We
also have sales outside the U.S. We utilize contract manufacturers to produce
certain of our products and have suppliers for various components, several of
which have operations located in foreign countries including China, Hungary,
Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Because of these operations, we are
subject to a number of risks including:
Shortages in component parts and raw
  materials;
Import and export and trade regulation changes
  that could erode our profit margins or restrict our ability to
  transport our products;
The burden and cost of complying with foreign and
  U.S. laws governing corporate conduct outside the U.S.; 
14


Adverse movement of foreign currencies against the
  U.S. dollar (the currency in which our results are reported) and global economic conditions generally;
Inflexible employee contracts and employment laws
  that may make it difficult to terminate or change the compensation structure for employees in some foreign countries in the
  event of business downturns;
Potential restrictions on the transfer of funds
  between countries;
Political, military, social and infrastructure
  risks, especially in emerging or developing economies;
Import and export duties and value-added taxes;
  and
Natural disasters, including earthquakes,
  flooding, typhoons and tsunamis. 
Any or all of these risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business. 
Our quarterly operating results could
fluctuate significantly, and past quarterly operating results should not be used
to predict future performance. 
Our quarterly operating results have
fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate significantly in the
future. As a result, our quarterly operating results should not be used to
predict future performance. Quarterly operating results could be materially and
adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

Failure to complete shipments in the last month of
  a quarter during which a substantial portion of our products are typically shipped;
Customers canceling, reducing, deferring or
  rescheduling significant orders as a result of excess inventory levels,
  weak economic conditions or other
  factors;
Customer fiscal year-ends and budget availability
  impacting customer demand for our products;
Declines in royalty revenues;
Declines in software revenues;
Product development and ramp cycles and product
  performance or quality issues;
Poor execution of and performance against expected
  sales and marketing plans and strategies;
Reduced demand from our OEM or distribution, VAR,
  DMR and other large customers; and
Increased competition. 
If we fail to meet our projected quarterly
results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.
If we fail to protect our intellectual
property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization, our
competitive position may suffer. 
Our future success and ability to compete
depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of
copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secrets laws and nondisclosure
agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. However, we
cannot provide assurance that patents will be issued with respect to pending or
future patent applications that we have filed or plan to file or that our
patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive
products or that any actions we have taken will adequately protect our
intellectual property rights. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements
with our employees, consultants, customers, potential customers and others as
required, in which we strictly limit access to, and distribution of, our
software, and further limit the disclosure and use of our proprietary
information.
Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain
or use our products or technology. Enforcing our intellectual property rights
can sometimes only be accomplished through the use of litigation, such as in the
litigation with Riverbed Technology, Inc. settled in fiscal 2009. Our
competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially
equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws
of the U.S.

Because we may order components from
suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products which
include these components, we could face a material inventory risk, which could
have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Although we use third parties to
manufacture certain of our products, we also manufacture products in-house.
Managing our in-house manufacturing capabilities presents a number of risks that
could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. For instance, as
part of our component planning, we place orders with or pay certain suppliers
for components in advance of receipt of customer orders. We occasionally enter
into negotiated orders with vendors early in the manufacturing process of our
products to ensure that we have sufficient components for our products to meet
anticipated customer demand. Because the design and manufacturing process for
these components can be complicated, it is possible that we could experience a
design or manufacturing flaw that could delay or even prevent the production of
the components for which we previously committed to pay. We also face the risk
of ordering too many components, or conversely, not enough components, since
supply orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than
actual customer orders. In addition, in some cases, we make non-cancelable order
commitments to our suppliers for work-in-progress, suppliers finished goods,
custom sub-assemblies, discontinued (end-of-life) components and Quantum-unique
raw materials that are necessary to meet our lead times for finished goods. If
we cannot change or be released from supply orders, we could incur costs from
the purchase of unusable components, either due to a delay in the production of
the components or other supplies or as a result of inaccurately predicting
supply orders in advance of customer orders. These same risks exist with our
third party contract manufacturing partners. Our business and operating results
could be materially and adversely affected if we incur increased costs, or are
unable to fulfill customer orders.
In addition, several of our disk drive
suppliers as well as suppliers of other components for our tape automation
products with operations in Thailand were impacted by flooding in October 2011,
which has affected those suppliers ability to manufacture a sufficient number
of drives and components in order to meet the demands of their customers,
including us. Certain suppliers have also announced anticipated price increases
for available drives. Continued supply shortages and pricing complexities could
materially and adversely affect our supply chain, customer relationships and
results of operations. Although we have purchased a supply of hard disk drives
to meet estimated demand for the near term, our business and operating results
could be materially and adversely affected if we incur increased costs or are
unable to meet customer demand.
Some of our manufacturing, component
production and service repair are outsourced to third party contract
manufacturers, component suppliers and service providers. If we cannot obtain
products, parts and services from these third parties in a cost effective and
timely manner that meets our customers expectations, this could materially and
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Many aspects of our supply chain and
operational results are dependent on the performance of third party business
partners. We face a number of risks as a result of these relationships,
including, among others:
Sole source of product
  supplyIn many cases, our business
  partner may be the sole source of supply for the products or parts they
  manufacture, or the services they provide, for
  us. Because we are relying on one supplier, we are at greater risk of
experiencing shortages, reduced production capacity or
  other delays in customer deliveries that could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost sales and increased expenses,
  each of which could materially damage customer relationships and result in lost revenue. 
Cost and purchase
  commitmentsWe may not be able to
  control the costs for the products our business partners manufacture for us or
  the services they provide to us. They procure
  inventory to build our products based upon a forecast of customer demand
  that we provide. We could be responsible for
  the financial impact on the contract manufacturer, supplier or service
provider of any reduction or product mix shift in the
  forecast relative to materials that they had already purchased under a prior forecast. Such a variance in forecasted demand
  could require us to pay them for finished goods
  in excess of current customer demand or for excess or obsolete inventory and
  generally incur higher costs. As a result, we
  could experience reduced gross margins and operating losses based on these
  purchase commitments. With respect to service
  providers, although we have contracts for most of our third party repair
  service vendors, the contract period may not be the same as the
  underlying service contract with our customer. In such
  cases, we face risks that the third party service provider may increase the
  cost of providing services over subsequent
  periods contracted with our customer.
16 


Financial condition and
  stabilityOur third party business
  partners may suffer adverse financial or operational results or may be
  negatively impacted by global and local
  economic conditions. Therefore, we may face interruptions in the supply
  of product components or service as a result of
  financial or other volatility affecting our supply chain. We could
suffer production downtime or increased costs to
  procure alternate products or services as a result of the possible
inadequate financial condition of one or more of our
  business partners. 
Quality and supplier
  conductWe have limited control over the
  quality of products and components produced and services provided by
  our supply chain business partners. Therefore,
  the quality of the products, parts or services may not be acceptable to
our customers and could result in customer
  dissatisfaction, lost revenue and increased warranty costs. In addition, we have limited control over the manner in which
  our business partners conduct their business. Sub-tier suppliers selected by the primary third party could have process
  control issues or could select components with
  latent defects that manifest over a longer period of time. Therefore, we may
  face negative consequences or publicity as a
  result of a third partys failure to comply with applicable compliance, trade,
  environmental or employment regulations.

Any or all of these risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business. In the past we have successfully
transitioned products or component supply from one supplier to another existing
supplier of different products or to our own facilities without significant
financial or operational impact, but there is no guarantee of our continued
ability to do so.
If we do not successfully manage the
changes that we have made and may continue to make to our infrastructure and
management, our business could be disrupted, and that could adversely impact our
results of operations and financial condition. 
Managing change is an important focus for
us. In recent years, we have implemented several significant initiatives
involving our sales and marketing, engineering and operations organizations,
aimed at increasing our efficiency and better aligning these groups with our
corporate strategy. In addition, we have reduced headcount to streamline and
consolidate our supporting functions as appropriate following past acquisitions
and in response to market or competitive conditions. Our inability to
successfully manage the changes that we implement, and detect and address issues
as they arise could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of
operations and financial condition.
Our stock price could become more
volatile if certain institutional investors were to increase or decrease the
number of shares they own. In addition, there are other factors and events that
could affect the trading prices of our common stock. 
A small number of institutional investors
have owned a significant portion of our common stock at various times in recent
years. If any or all of these investors were to decide to purchase significant
additional shares or to sell significant amounts or all of the common shares
they currently own, that may cause our stock price to be more volatile. For
example, there have been instances in the past where a shareholder with a
significant equity position began to sell shares, putting downward pressure on
our stock price for the duration of their selling activity. In these situations,
selling pressure outweighed buying demand and our stock price declined. This
situation has occurred due to our stock price falling below institutional
investors price thresholds and our volatility increasing beyond investors
volatility parameters causing even greater sell pressure. The opposite has also
occurred whereby a shareholder purchases a significant equity position, creating
demand for our common stock and an increased stock price. 
Trading prices of our common stock may
fluctuate in response to a number of other events and factors, such as:

General economic conditions;
Changes in interest rates;
Fluctuations in the stock market in general and
  market prices for technology companies in particular;
Quarterly variations in our operating
  results; 
17 


New products, services, innovations and strategic
  developments by our competitors or us, or business combinations and investments by our competitors or us;
Changes in financial estimates by us or securities
  analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;
Changes in our capital structure, including
  issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; and
Strategic acquisitions. 
Any of these events and factors may cause
our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and
financing opportunities. 
Our design and production processes are
subject to safety and environmental regulations which could lead to increased
costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 
We are subject to a variety of laws and
regulations relating to, among other things, the use, storage, discharge and
disposal of materials and substances used in our facilities and manufacturing
processes as well as the safety of our employees and the public. Directives
first introduced in the European Union impose a take back obligation on
manufacturers for the financing of the collection, recovery and disposal of
electrical and electronic equipment and restrict the use of certain potentially
hazardous materials, including lead and some flame retardants, in electronic
products and components. Other jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally
have since introduced similar requirements, and we anticipate that future
regulations might further restrict allowable materials in our products, require
the establishment of additional recycling or take back programs or mandate the
measurement and reduction of carbon emissions into the environment. We have
implemented procedures and will likely continue to introduce new processes to
comply with current and future safety and environmental legislation. However,
measures taken now or in the future to comply with such legislation may
adversely affect our manufacturing or personnel costs or product sales by
requiring us to acquire costly equipment or materials, redesign production
processes or to incur other significant expenses in adapting our manufacturing
programs or waste disposal and emission management processes. Furthermore,
safety or environmental claims or our failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines
against us, or the suspension of affected operations, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We are subject to many laws and
regulations, and violation of or changes in those requirements could materially
and adversely affect our business.

We are subject to numerous U.S. and
international laws regarding corporate conduct, fair competition, preventing
corruption and import and export practices, including requirements applicable to
U.S. government contractors. While we maintain a rigorous corporate ethics and
compliance program, we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny,
significant monetary fines or penalties, suspension of business opportunities or
loss of jurisdictional operating rights as a result of any failure to comply
with those requirements. We may also be exposed to potential liability resulting
from our business partners violation of these requirements. In addition, U.S.
regulatory agencies have recently introduced new enforcement efforts that may
proactively seek conduct-related information from companies operating in certain
targeted industries or locations, without regard for whether potential
violations have been identified. If we were to receive such an information
request, we may incur increased personnel and legal costs in order to adequately
review and respond to the request. Further our U.S. and international business
models are based on currently applicable regulatory requirements and exceptions.
Changes in those requirements or exceptions could necessitate changes to our
business model. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely impact
our business and operating results.
We may be sued by our customers as a
result of failures in our products.

We face potential liability for
performance problems of our products because our end users employ our storage
technologies for the storage and backup of important data and to satisfy
regulatory requirements. Although we maintain technology errors and omissions
insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not
be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any
imposition of liability or accrual of litigation costs that is not covered by
insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business. In
addition, we could potentially face claims for product liability from our
customers if our products cause property damage or bodily injury. Although we
maintain general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential
claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability
that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or accrual of litigation costs
that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could
harm our business.
18 


We must maintain appropriate levels of
service parts inventories. If we do not have sufficient service parts
inventories, we may experience increased levels of customer dissatisfaction. If
we hold excessive service parts inventories, we may incur financial losses.

We maintain levels of service parts
inventories to satisfy future warranty obligations and also to earn service
revenue by providing enhanced and extended warranty and repair service during
and beyond the warranty period. We estimate the required amount of service parts
inventories based on historical usage and forecasts of future warranty
requirements, including estimates of failure rates and costs to repair, and out
of warranty revenue. Given the significant levels of judgment inherently
involved in the process, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to
maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories to satisfy customer
needs and to avoid financial losses from excess service parts inventories. If we
are unable to maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and
adversely impacted. 
Because we rely heavily on distributors
and other resellers to market and sell our products, if one or more distributors
were to experience a significant deterioration in its financial condition or its
relationship with us, this could disrupt the distribution of our products and
reduce our revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating results. 
In certain product and geographic segments
we heavily utilize distributors and value added resellers to perform the
functions necessary to market and sell our products. To fulfill this role, the
distributor must maintain an acceptable level of financial stability,
creditworthiness and the ability to successfully manage business relationships
with the customers it serves directly. Under our distributor agreements with
these companies, each of the distributors determines the type and amount of our
products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it
sells to its customers. If the distributor is unable to perform in an acceptable
manner, we may be required to reduce the amount of sales of our product to the
distributor or terminate the relationship. We may also incur financial losses
for product returns from distributors or for the failure or refusal of
distributors to pay obligations owed to us. Either scenario could result in
fewer of our products being available to the affected market segments, reduced
levels of customer satisfaction and/or increased expenses, which could in turn
have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
From time to time we have made
acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could
harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 
As a part of our business strategy, we
have in the past and may make acquisitions in the future, subject to certain
debt covenants. We may also make significant investments in complementary
companies, products or technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate such
acquisitions or significant investments, it could harm our business, financial
condition and operating results. Risks that we may face in our efforts to
integrate any recent or future acquisitions include, among others:
Failure to realize anticipated savings and
  benefits from the acquisition;
Difficulties in assimilating and retaining
  employees;
Potential incompatibility of business
  cultures;
Coordinating geographically separate
  organizations;
Diversion of managements attention from ongoing
  business concerns;
Coordinating infrastructure operations in a rapid
  and efficient manner;
The potential inability to maximize our financial
  and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and
  services;
Failure of acquired technology or products to
  provide anticipated revenue or margin contribution;
Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses
  associated with the acquisition;
Costs and delays in implementing or integrating
  common systems and procedures;
Reduction or loss of customer orders due to the
  potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay;
Impairment of existing customer, supplier and
  strategic relationships of either company;
Insufficient cash flows from operations to fund
  the working capital and investment requirements;
Difficulties in entering markets in which we have
  no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such
markets have stronger market positions;
The possibility that we may not receive a
  favorable return on our investment, the original investment may become
impaired, and/or we may incur losses from these
  investments;
Dissatisfaction or performance problems with the
  acquired company; 
19


The assumption of risks of the acquired company
  that are difficult to quantify, such as litigation;
The cost associated with the acquisition,
  including restructuring actions, which may require cash payments that,
  if large enough, could materially and adversely
  affect our liquidity; and
Assumption of unknown liabilities or other
  unanticipated adverse events or circumstances. 
Acquisitions present many risks, and we
may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the
time of any transaction. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to
successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we
may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could negatively impact our
business, financial condition and operating results. 
Our capital structure includes debt,
which imposes upon us debt service obligations and our credit facility contains
various operating and financial covenants that limit our discretion in the
operation of our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows
from operations to meet these debt obligations or remain in compliance with the
covenants our business, financial condition and operating results could be
materially and adversely affected. 
Our level of indebtedness presents risks
to investors, both in terms of the constraints that it places on our ability to
operate our business and because of the possibility that we may not generate
sufficient cash to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it
becomes due. 
Potential consequences of having debt
include:
Requiring that we dedicate a portion of our cash
  flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital,
  capital expenditures, research and development and other cash requirements;
Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or
  reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we
  compete, such as limiting our ability to engage
  in mergers and acquisitions activity, which may place us at a
  competitive disadvantage;
Mandatory field audits and control of cash
  receipts by the lender if we do not maintain average liquidity above
  certain thresholds;
Increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic
  and industry conditions;
Making it more difficult or impossible for us to
  make payments on other indebtedness or obligations; and
Limiting our ability to incur additional debt on
  acceptable terms, if at all. 
Our credit facility agreement contains
restrictive covenants that require us to comply with and maintain certain
financial tests and ratios, as well as restrict our ability, subject to certain
thresholds, to:
Incur debt;
Incur liens;
Make acquisitions of businesses or entities or
  sell certain assets;
Make investments, including loans, guarantees and
  advances;
Engage in transactions with affiliates;
Pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases;
  and
Enter into certain restrictive agreements.

Our ability to comply with covenants
contained in this credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control,
including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.
Our credit facility agreement is
collateralized by a pledge of all of our assets. If we were to default and were
unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, the lender would have a right to
foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations under the credit
agreement. Any such action on the part of the lender against us could have a
materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
20


If the future outcomes related to the
estimates used in recording tax liabilities to various taxing authorities result
in higher tax liabilities than estimated, then we would have to record tax
charges, which could be material. 
We have provided amounts and recorded
liabilities for probable and estimable tax adjustments that may be proposed by
various taxing authorities in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. If events
occur that indicate payments of these amounts will be less than estimated, then
reversals of these liabilities would create tax benefits being recognized in the
periods when we determine the liabilities have reduced. Conversely, if events
occur which indicate that payments of these amounts will be greater than
estimated, then tax charges and additional liabilities would be recorded. In
particular, various foreign jurisdictions could challenge the characterization
or transfer pricing of certain intercompany transactions. In the event of an
unfavorable outcome of such challenge, there exists the possibility of a
material tax charge and adverse impact on the results of operations in the
period in which the matter is resolved or an unfavorable outcome becomes
probable and estimable. 
Certain changes in stock ownership could
result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
carryovers that can be utilized each year. Should we undergo such a change in
stock ownership, it would severely limit the usage of these carryover tax
attributes against future income, resulting in additional tax charges, which
could be material. 
We are exposed to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency
exchange rates relative to our position in such currencies could have a
materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 
We do not currently use derivative
financial instruments for foreign currency hedging or speculative purposes. We
have used in the past, and may use in the future, foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. To the
extent that we have assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency that
are inadequately hedged or not hedged at all, we may be subject to foreign
currency losses, which could be significant.
Our international operations can act as a
natural hedge when both operating expenses and sales are denominated in local
currencies. In these instances, although an unfavorable change in the exchange
rate of a foreign currency against the U.S. dollar would result in lower sales
when translated to U.S. dollars, operating expenses would also be lower in these
circumstances. An increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged
for U.S. dollars would require more of that particular foreign currency to equal
a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before such rate increase. In such
cases, and if we were to price our products and services in that particular
foreign currency, we would receive fewer U.S. dollars than we would have
received prior to such rate increase for the foreign currency. Likewise, if we
were to price our products and services in U.S. dollars while competitors priced
their products in a local currency, an increase in the relative strength of the
U.S. dollar would result in our prices being uncompetitive in those markets.
Such fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On September 12, 2011, Compression
Technology Solutions LLC (CTS) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against a
group of companies, consisting of Quantum, CA., Inc., EMC Corporation,
Hewlett-Packard Company, International Business Machines Corp., NetApp, Inc. and
Quest Software, Inc., in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of
Missouri, alleging that certain unspecified products of the defendants,
characterized as deduplication software systems, and, in the case of Quantum,
including Quantums DXi Series Deduplication software, fall within the scope
of patent 5,414,650. CTS is seeking injunctive relief, as well as the recovery
of monetary damages, including treble damages for willful infringement. We do
not believe we infringe the CTS patent; we believe that the CTS patent is
invalid, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. In April 2012, our motion
to transfer venue was granted and the lawsuit was transferred to the U.S.
District Court in the Northern District of California. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, we cannot identify probable or estimable damages
related to the lawsuit.

ITEM 7.  

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND
      ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
OVERVIEW
Quantum Corporation (Quantum, the
Company, us or we), founded in 1980, is a global expert in data protection
and big data management. We provide solutions for storing and protecting
information in physical, virtual, cloud and big data environments that are
designed to help customers be certain they are maximizing the value of their
data over its entire lifecycle. With our solutions, customers can better adapt
in a world of continuing change by keeping and protecting more data for a longer
period of time while reducing costs and increasing return on investment. We work closely
with a broad network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), direct
marketing resellers (DMRs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and
other suppliers to meet customers evolving data protection and big data
management needs. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol QTM.
We offer a comprehensive range of
solutions for data protection and big data management challenges providing
performance and value to end user customers of all sizes, from small businesses
to multinational enterprises. We believe our combination of expertise,
innovation and platform independence allows us to solve data protection and big
data management issues more easily, cost-effectively and securely. Our open
systems solutions are designed to provide significant storage efficiencies,
scalability and cost savings while protecting customers prior investments. They
include DXi® deduplication systems for high speed recovery and
reliability, Scalar® tape automation products for disaster recovery
and long-term data retention, StorNext® data management software and
appliances for high-performance big data file sharing and archiving and
vmPRO solutions for protecting virtual machine data. We also offer
cloud solutions for cloud-based backup, fast restore, data recovery and business
continuity. In addition, we have the global scale and scope to support our
worldwide customer base.
Business

We earn our revenue from the sale of
products, systems and services through an array of channel partners and our
sales force to reach end user customers of all sizes. Our products are sold
under both the Quantum brand name and the names of various OEM customers. We
have a broad portfolio of disk systems, software solutions, tape automation
systems, tape drives and other devices and media. Our data management software
provides technology for shared workflow applications and multi-tiered archiving
in high-performance, large-scale storage environments. We also offer vmPRO
software, a virtualization data protection software with advanced utilities
designed to dramatically improve and simplify virtual data protection in
midrange and larger data centers. We have introduced a cloud-based data
protection technology platform for public and private clouds. The majority of
our disk systems and tape automation systems include software features that
provide disk and tape integration capabilities with our core deduplication and
replication technologies. In addition, our service offerings include a broad
range of coverage options to provide the level of support for the widest
possible range of information technology (IT) environments. 
We have been transforming the company into
a systems and solutions provider over the past few years, introducing offerings
in the significant growth markets of disk and software data protection and big
data and archive and introducing strategic enhancements and offerings in the
tape automation market while continuing to provide service and support to new
and existing customers. We have implemented a number of initiatives in an effort
to drive branded revenue growth. One key initiative for fiscal 2012 was to grow
the independent channel for Quantum branded products. Another key area of focus
for fiscal 2012 was continuing to expand and improve our products and solutions,
with emphasis on branded disk systems and software solutions, including
introducing and ramping sales of the StorNext appliance family and virtual
offerings.
Our efforts in fiscal 2012 were reflected
in increased total branded revenue and record revenue in disk systems and
software solutions in fiscal 2012. Total branded revenue increased for the
second consecutive fiscal year and revenue from disk systems and software
solutions increased 8% from fiscal 2011. In addition, branded disk systems
revenue and branded software solutions revenue were both records, increasing 19%
and 15%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Growth of the independent
channel contributed to this revenue growth. We added a significant number of new
disk systems and software solutions customers, and in the mature tape automation
market, we added a considerable number of new customers for midrange and
enterprise tape automation products. This past fiscal year we implemented
initiatives that improved our sales team, our channel team and our technical
sales team. In addition, we improved the training and alignment with our top
channel partners on our products and solutions. 
25


We continued our technology and product
innovation in fiscal 2012. We enhanced our DXi product line, introduced a new
family of StorNext appliances and added new management, security and
availability features to our Scalar tape libraries. Following the acquisition of
Pancetera Software, Inc. (Pancetera) in June 2011, we integrated the
technology into our portfolio with the launch of the vmPRO virtual server
protection solutions and laid the groundwork for our cloud-based data protection
platform. The strength, value and quality of our products were recognized with
several industry awards and honors, notably for the DXi6700 and vmPRO 4000, in
addition to our enterprise and midrange tape automation libraries. 
We offer products and solutions in several
high growth markets, namely the markets for disk-based back up, big data,
virtual data protection and cloud based solutions. Our opportunity and goal in
these markets is to increase our product and solution offerings and to
significantly grow revenue from sales of our disk systems and software solutions
to increase total revenue. We project total revenue in the tape automation
market will be essentially the same over the next few years with growth in
demand for tape automation products used as a storage tier in the big data and
archive market offset by declines in demand for tape automation products in the
data protection market. Our opportunity and goal for tape automation systems is
to grow our market share with our innovative products. 
Our goal for fiscal 2013 is to grow total
revenue, driven primarily by increased revenue from our disk systems and
software solutions, with minimal expected growth in branded tape automation
revenue. We expect this revenue growth to be tempered by declines in tape
automation revenue from OEM customers and a decline in royalty
revenue.
Results 
In fiscal 2012, we saw improved revenue
momentum with our partners, especially for midrange disk systems, and our
continued efforts to increase revenue from disk systems and software solutions
resulted in an 8% increase in disk systems and software solutions revenue. We
invested significantly in our product portfolio in fiscal 2012, introducing a
number of new products, including our StorNext software appliances and virtual
systems software and data protection solutions. In fiscal 2012, we also
continued to develop new technologies that will be the framework for future new
product introductions.
We had total revenue of $652.4 million in
fiscal 2012, a 3% decrease from fiscal 2011 primarily due to expected reductions
in OEM sales, including OEM deduplication software revenue and royalty revenue.
Our product revenue from OEM customers decreased 14% while revenue from branded
products increased 3% from fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased disk systems
and software solutions revenue. Service revenue decreased primarily due to lower
hardware service contract revenues from certain legacy branded tape automation
products that reached end of service life. Our focus on growing the branded
business during the fiscal year is reflected in the greater proportion of
non-royalty revenue from our branded business, at 81% in fiscal 2012, compared
to 79% in fiscal 2011 and 74% in fiscal 2010. Royalty revenue decreased 12%
primarily due to declining royalties from older DLT media and, to a lesser
extent, from lower LTO royalties.
Our gross margin percentage decreased 10
basis points from fiscal 2011 to 42.0% largely due to a shift in our sales mix
that was comprised of less high margin OEM deduplication software revenue and
royalty revenue than the prior year, mostly offset by decreased intangible
amortization.
Operating expenses increased $11.9
million, or 5%, primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses, largely
due to growing our branded sales force to increase branded revenue and expand
our position with existing and new channel partners to drive future growth. We
had $5.2 million in income from operations in fiscal 2012, down from $24.7
million in fiscal 2011.
Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2012
largely due to a decrease in average interest rates from refinancing
subordinated term debt in fiscal 2011. In addition during fiscal 2012, we
refinanced our senior secured term debt with a revolving credit facility with
terms that are financially more beneficial and provide additional flexibility to
run our business. During fiscal 2012, we paid $104.3 million in principal to
fully repay the senior secured term debt and borrowed $49.5 million on a new
revolving credit line. We continued to generate cash from operating activities,
with $45.7 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $52.3 million in fiscal
2011.

Total revenue decreased in fiscal 2012
compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to expected reductions in OEM and royalty
revenue. The largest decreases in OEM revenue were from lower deduplication
software, tape automation products, devices and service revenue. Partially
offsetting these decreases were increased sales of branded disk systems and
software solutions in fiscal 2012.
Total revenue decreased in fiscal 2011
compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to expected reductions in OEM, service and
royalty revenue. We had a slight increase in product revenue in fiscal
2011 primarily due to increased sales of disk systems and software solutions
revenue, largely offset by expected reductions in OEM devices and media revenue
from a number of devices reaching end of life and expected decreases in OEM tape
automation systems revenue.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

Our product revenue, which includes sales
of our hardware and software products sold through both our Quantum branded and
OEM channels, decreased slightly from fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased
sales of tape automation systems and devices and media, mostly offset by
increased revenue from disk systems and software solutions. Revenue from sales
of branded products increased 3% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011
primarily due to increased sales of disk systems and software
solutions.
A primary goal for fiscal 2012 was to grow
revenue from disk systems and software solutions. We introduced new disk
products, a new product line of StorNext appliances and released upgrades to
both disk systems and to software solutions in fiscal 2012, all of which
contributed to fiscal 2012 revenue. We continued our efforts to expand
engagement with our channel partners to increase sales of disk systems and
software solutions. Revenue from disk systems and software solutions increased
8% to $119.0 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to
increased midrange disk product sales followed by the addition of StorNext
appliances. Midrange disk systems revenue increases were primarily due to the
addition of revenue from our DXi6701 and DXi6702 products. Tempering these
increases was an expected decrease in OEM deduplication software revenue due to
our primary OEM deduplication software customer becoming a competitor in fiscal
2010 and revenue recognized in accordance with contractual requirements in
fiscal 2011 that was not repeated.
27


Tape automation systems sales decreased
$9.1 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. This decrease was
primarily due to expected declines in OEM revenue, followed by decreased branded
enterprise and entry-level tape automation systems revenue. 
Product revenue from devices, including
tape drives and removable hard drives, and non-royalty media sales decreased 5%
to $87.3 million primarily due to anticipated decreases in sales of older
branded and OEM device technologies that reached, or are nearing, end of life.
Largely offsetting the decrease was an increase in branded media revenue
primarily due to the events in Japan in March 2011 and resulting concern of
shortages and supply disruption in the market. We continue to be strategic with
media sales and have chosen to not pursue opportunities that do not provide
sufficient margins.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Product revenue in fiscal 2011 increased
slightly from fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased sales of disk systems and
software solutions, mostly offset by anticipated decreases in devices and media
and tape automation systems. Revenue from sales of branded products increased 7%
in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 also primarily due to increased sales of
disk systems and software solutions.
A primary goal for fiscal 2011 was to grow
revenue from disk systems and software solutions. We introduced new disk
products and upgrades to both disk systems and to software solutions in fiscal
2011, and we also worked to expand engagement with our channel partners to
increase sales of disk systems and software solutions. Revenue from disk systems
and software solutions increased 33% to $110.7 million in fiscal 2011 compared
to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased midrange disk product sales. Midrange
disk systems revenue nearly tripled from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the
addition of revenue from our DXi6700 product family and increased sales of the
DXi6500 product family. In addition, StorNext software revenue also continued to
increase compared to prior years. As a result of these revenue increases, disk
systems and software solutions comprised a greater proportion of both product
revenue and total revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
Tape automation systems sales decreased
$9.8 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This decrease was
primarily due to expected declines in OEM revenues from our decision to exit
portions of this market in prior years as well as declining demand in the
overall tape automation market. We had a smaller decrease in branded tape
automation systems revenue due to declines in enterprise and midrange product
sales mostly offset by increased entry-level product sales from the addition of
the Scalar i40 and i80 products. 
Product revenue from devices and
non-royalty media sales decreased 15% to $92.1 million primarily due to
anticipated decreases in sales of older OEM device technologies that reached, or
are nearing, end of life. We continued to be strategic with media sales in
fiscal 2011 and chose to not pursue opportunities that would not provide
sufficient margins. Media revenues were approximately the same as fiscal
2010.
Service Revenue
Service revenue includes revenue from
sales of hardware service contracts, product repair, installation and
professional services. Hardware service contracts are typically purchased by our
customers to extend the warranty or to provide faster service response time, or
both. Service revenue decreased 4% to $144.4 million in fiscal 2012 compared to
fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower hardware service contract revenues from end
of service life on higher revenue service contracts for certain legacy branded
tape automation products and to a lesser extent from decreased OEM product
repair services. Service contracts on certain newer technology branded products
provide lower revenue than service contracts on older technology branded
products nearing end of service life. OEM service revenue decreases are
primarily due to a number of our device products that reached end of service
life in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012.
Service revenue decreased 3% to $151.1
million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to planned
decreases in OEM product repair services and, to a lesser extent, reduced
hardware service contracts from our OEM customers. OEM service revenue decreases
are due to many of our device products that reached, or are nearing, end of
service life. Service revenue from our branded products was approximately the
same as fiscal 2010.
28


Royalty Revenue 
Royalty revenue declined 12%, or $7.6
million, in fiscal 2012 and decreased 7%, or $4.6 million, in fiscal 2011
primarily due to expected decreases of maturing DLT media unit sales by media
licensees in both fiscal years. Royalties from LTO media decreased 4% in fiscal
2012 primarily due to decreased LTO media unit sales by media licensees. In
fiscal 2011, the DLT royalty decrease was partially offset by increased
royalties from LTO media.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal
2011
The 10 basis point decrease in gross
margin percentage in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was due to largely
offsetting factors. Gross margin decreased due to less high margin revenue in
our product mix, largely from decreased OEM deduplication software revenue and
royalty revenue. Both OEM deduplication software and royalty revenue provide
among the highest margins of our portfolio. Gross margin was favorably impacted
by lower intangible amortization from certain intangibles becoming fully
amortized in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

The 100 basis point increase in gross
margin percentage in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was largely due to
lower intangible amortization from certain intangibles becoming fully amortized
in the first half of fiscal 2011. In addition, gross margin was favorably
impacted by the continued shift in sales mix toward higher margin products and
services. Product sales through our branded channels comprised a higher
percentage of non-royalty revenue in fiscal 2011 than fiscal 2010. Branded sales
comprised 79% of non-royalty revenue in fiscal 2011, compared to 74% for fiscal
2010. Sales of branded products typically generate higher gross margins than
sales to our OEM customers; however, as noted above, OEM deduplication software
revenue provides one of our highest product margins. Contributing to the change
in our revenue mix in fiscal 2011 was our emphasis on sales growth of our disk
systems and software solutions which increased to 17% of revenue in fiscal 2011
compared to 12% of revenue in the prior year. The gross margin percentage
increase was tempered by the $4.6 million decrease in royalty revenue.

Product Gross Margin 
Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal
2011
Product gross margin dollars decreased 1%
in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the 1% decrease in
product revenue. However, product gross margin percentage improved
slightly from fiscal 2011. The product gross margin increase was primarily due to
a $7.1 million decrease in intangible amortization in fiscal 2012, mostly offset
by the decrease in high margin OEM deduplication software revenue compared to
fiscal 2011. 
29


Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Product gross margin dollars increased
$7.0 million, or 5%, and product gross margin percentage improved approximately
150 basis points from fiscal 2010 although product revenue was approximately the
same in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. These margin increases were
primarily due to a $7.4 million decrease in intangible amortization in fiscal
2011. Product gross margin was also favorably impacted by the change in our
product revenue mix compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue from branded product sales
increased 7% in fiscal 2011. In addition, revenue from disk systems and software
solutions increased to 24% of product revenue in fiscal 2011, compared to 18% of
product revenue in fiscal 2010. Offsetting the change in product revenue mix was
increased warranty expense due to warranty benefits in fiscal 2010 compared to
warranty expense in fiscal 2011. Warranty benefits in the prior year were
attributable to decreasing overall service and repair costs, a declining number
of in-warranty units repaired and numerous products reaching the end of their
warranty coverage. 
Service Gross Margin 
Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal
2011
Service gross margin dollars decreased
$0.9 million, or approximately 2%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Our
service gross margin percentage increased 110 basis points to 38.7% in fiscal
2012, largely due to decreased external provider expenses and inventory
allowance expense. External service provider expense decreased due to a
combination of bringing repair of additional product lines in-house and
negotiating lower rates on the renewals of contracts with certain service
providers in fiscal 2012. We had higher inventory allowance expense in fiscal
2011 due to end of service life plans for several products. In addition, we had
a change in the mix of services for OEM repairs and for our branded products
under contract. Our service activities for fiscal 2012 reflected a greater
proportion of revenue from branded products under contract, which have
relatively higher margins than margins for OEM repair services.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal
2010
Service gross margin dollars increased
$1.1 million, or approximately 2%, despite a 3% reduction in service revenue in
fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. Additionally, our service gross margin
percentage increased 200 basis points to 37.6% in fiscal 2011 from 35.6% in
fiscal 2010, primarily due to expense reductions in our service delivery model.
In addition, branded service revenue comprised a larger proportion of service
revenue in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 primarily due to declines in repairs
for OEM customers. We reduced expense in our service delivery model by repairing
certain product lines in our facilities at a lower cost in fiscal 2011 than we
incurred with external service providers in prior years.

The increase in research and development
expenses for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in
salaries and benefits from investment in our disk systems software and hardware
and our virtual systems engineering teams to support new product development
efforts. Partially offsetting this increase was a $0.5 million decrease in
travel expenses compared to the prior year.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

The increase in research and development

engineering teams to support new product development efforts. Partially
offsetting this increase was a $0.8 million decrease in project materials due to
the types of products under development and related testing material
requirements compared to the prior year.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

Sales and marketing expenses increased in
fiscal 2012 primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in salaries and benefits,
including commissions. Commissions increased due to increased branded product
revenue and salaries and benefits increased largely due to growing our branded
sales force. In addition, travel expenses increased $1.0 million due in part to
increased airfare and fuel costs, incremental travel by our sales engineers to
support customer sales and increased travel for sales training events to expand
our position with existing and new channel partners to drive future
growth.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Sales and marketing expenses increased in
fiscal 2011 primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in salaries and benefits
from growing our branded sales force and marketing team. In addition,
advertising and marketing expenditures increased by $1.8 million from supporting
new product introductions and efforts to expand our position with existing and
new channel partners to drive future growth.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

The increase in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to a $2.2 million increase in salaries and benefits
primarily from increased stock compensation expense due to equity grants related
to promotions and merit increases. In addition, we had $1.4 million in credits
in fiscal 2011 primarily due to accounts receivable recoveries and a litigation
settlement that were not repeated.
We may incur higher than typical legal
costs in fiscal 2013 to defend ourselves while a patent infringement lawsuit
brought by Compression Technology Solutions LLC (CTS) is ongoing. The CTS
lawsuit is discussed in more detail in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies
under Legal Proceedings. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we
cannot identify probable or estimable damages related to the lawsuit at this
time.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

The decrease in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in net VAT expense
primarily due to provisions for VAT audits during fiscal 2010 that were not
repeated in fiscal 2011. In addition, we had a $0.8 million decrease in legal
expenses compared to fiscal 2010.

Our restructuring actions are steps
undertaken to reduce costs in an effort to return to consistent profitability.
In fiscal 2011 and 2012, restructuring actions to consolidate operations
supporting our business were the result of strategic management decisions. In
fiscal 2010, restructuring actions to consolidate operations supporting our
business were primarily in response to the global recession. For additional
information and disclosure of restructuring charges refer to Note 8
Restructuring Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Until we
achieve consistent and sustainable levels of profitability, we may incur
restructuring charges in the future from additional cost reduction efforts.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

The decrease in restructuring charges in
fiscal 2012 was due to a $2.0 million decrease in severance charges due to fewer
positions eliminated during the year as a result of strategic management
decisions and a $0.9 million decrease in restructuring charges related to cost
of revenue due to lower actual costs than estimated to exit a supplier
relationship. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $0.9 million increase
in facility restructuring charges due to negotiating a $0.3 million settlement
for a lease liability on a vacated facility in India in fiscal 2012 and $0.6
million in credits in fiscal 2011 primarily due to negotiating settlements for
lease liabilities for amounts lower than the outstanding lease
contracts.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

The decrease in restructuring charges in
fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $5.3 million decrease in facility
restructuring charges from vacating and accruing the remaining contractual lease
payments on four facilities in fiscal 2010 as well as negotiating settlements
for lease liabilities on two vacated facilities in the U.S. for amounts lower
than the outstanding lease contracts in fiscal 2011. Partially offsetting this
decrease was a $3.0 million increase in severance and benefits expense as a
result of strategic management decisions to consolidate operations supporting
our business in fiscal 2011. The restructuring charges related to cost of
revenue were costs from exiting a supplier relationship in fiscal 2011.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

Other income and expense decreased
primarily due to a $1.6 million net decrease in investment gains from fiscal
2011, largely due to gains from private technology venture limited partnerships
that were not repeated. In addition, we had a $0.4 million net increase in
foreign exchange losses primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against
the euro in fiscal 2012. These were partially offset by $0.9 million in fees for
an amendment to our senior secured credit agreement in fiscal 2011 that were not
repeated. 
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Other income and expense was relatively
unchanged in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 from the net result of
offsetting changes. We had a $1.2 million decrease from fair value gains on an
interest rate collar in fiscal 2010 that expired in fiscal 2010 and $0.9 million
in fees for an amendment to our senior secured credit agreement in fiscal 2011.
These were offset by a $0.9 million net increase in foreign exchange gains
primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening against the Australian dollar and the
euro in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and a net increase of $0.9 million
in investment gains on private technology venture limited
partnerships.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011

Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2012
compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreased average interest rates from
refinancing subordinated term debt that had a 12% interest rate with 3.5%
convertible subordinated notes issued in November 2010. In addition, we had a
lower senior secured term debt balance in fiscal 2012 than fiscal 2011 which
also contributed to decreased interest expense.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2011
compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreased average interest rates from
refinancing subordinated term debt with 3.5% convertible subordinated notes
issued in November 2010. In addition, we reduced our outstanding senior secured
term debt balance by $81.7 million and this term debt had lower interest rates
compared to fiscal 2010, both of which contributed to decreased interest
expense.
In addition to the items noted above,
interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs for debt
facilities. For further information, refer to Note 7 Long-Term Debt and
Convertible Subordinated Debt to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012,
we fully repaid our senior secured term loan with Credit Suisse using cash on
hand and borrowings of $49.5 million from a new credit facility with Wells
Fargo. In connection with this debt extinguishment, we wrote off $2.3 million of
unamortized debt costs related to the Credit Suisse credit agreement.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2011,
we fully repaid outstanding subordinated term loans by issuing $135 million
aggregate principal of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes. In connection with
this debt extinguishment, we wrote off $1.2 million of unamortized debt costs
related to the subordinated term loans. 
During fiscal 2010, we refinanced $137.9
million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 4.75% convertible
subordinated debt, consisting of $87.2 million through a tender offer and $50.7
million in a private transaction. In connection with these transactions, we
recorded a gain on debt extinguishment, net of costs, of $12.9 million comprised
of a gross gain of $15.6 million, reduced by $2.1 million in expenses and $0.6
million of unamortized debt costs related to the refinanced notes.

The $0.9 million increase in tax expense
in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the release in
fiscal 2011 of $0.9 million in tax liabilities in foreign jurisdictions that

compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the release of $0.9 million in tax
liabilities in foreign jurisdictions in fiscal 2011. Tax expense in fiscal 2012
and fiscal 2010 was primarily comprised of foreign income taxes and state taxes.
Tax expense in fiscal 2011 was primarily comprised of foreign income taxes and
state taxes, offset by the release of tax liabilities in foreign jurisdictions
due to a favorable settlement and expiration of statutes of
limitation.

The increase in share-based compensation
expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $3.7
million increase in expense related to restricted stock units due to more
restricted stock units granted for employee performance merit increases at a
higher grant-date stock price in fiscal 2012 than fiscal 2011. In addition we
had a $0.6 million increase in expense related to the employee stock purchase
plan (ESPP) due to increased participation in fiscal 2012. This was partially
offset by a $1.0 million decrease in expense related to options due to more
options vesting in fiscal 2012 than were replaced by new option grants.

The increase in share-based compensation
expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the
reinstatement of the ESPP in January 2010. Share-based compensation expense
related to the ESPP increased $1.2 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal
2010 due to the cancellation of the ESPP for the majority of fiscal 2010. The
increase was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in expense related to
our restricted stock units as more restricted stock vested in fiscal 2011 than
was replaced by new restricted stock unit grants.

Fiscal 2012 
The $54.5 million difference between
reported net loss and cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was
primarily due to $60.4 million of non-cash expenses, including $23.1 million in
amortization, $13.7 million in share-based compensation, $11.8 million in
depreciation and $10.7 million in service parts lower of cost or market
adjustment. In addition, we had an $8.1 million increase in deferred revenue
primarily due to increased sales of service contracts. Partially offsetting
these was a $21.4 million use of cash from increased manufacturing inventories
primarily due to purchasing materials to build and configure new
products and securing hard disk drives in light of supply constraints from
flooding in Thailand earlier in the fiscal year.
35


Cash used in investing activities during
fiscal 2012 was primarily due to $11.4 million in purchases of property and
equipment and $8.2 million of cash paid, net of cash acquired, for our
acquisition of Pancetera. Equipment purchases were primarily for engineering
equipment and testing hardware to support product development
activities.
Cash used in financing activities during
fiscal 2012 was primarily due to net debt repayments of $55.8 million, including
$104.3 million to fully repay our senior secured term debt. We refinanced a
portion of the senior secured term debt with a new revolving credit facility in
fiscal 2012. This refinancing is described in more detail below in Capital
Resources and Financial Condition. Partially offsetting cash used in financing
activities was $10.4 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options and issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase
plan.
Fiscal 2011 
The $47.8 million difference between
reported net income and cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was
primarily due to $67.5 million of non-cash expenses, including $30.3 million in
amortization, $13.8 million in service parts lower of cost or market adjustment,
$11.7 million in depreciation and $10.4 million in share-based compensation.
These noncash expenses were partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in
accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales of products and service
billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010. 
Cash used in investing activities during
fiscal 2011 was primarily due to $12.3 million in purchases of property and
equipment. Equipment purchases were primarily for engineering test equipment to
support product development activities.
Cash used in financing activities during
fiscal 2011 was primarily due to net debt repayments of $95.5 million, including
$81.7 million of principal on our senior secured term debt. We refinanced
subordinated term loans with 3.50% convertible subordinated debt in fiscal 2011,
and the repayment of this long-term debt was offset by borrowings of convertible
subordinated debt, net. For additional information regarding this refinancing,
see Note 7 Long-Term Debt and Convertible Subordinated Debt to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we received $16.5 million from
the issuance of common stock. 
Fiscal 2010 
The $83.5 million difference between
reported net income and cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was
primarily due to $71.3 million of non-cash expenses comprised of $38.5 million
in amortization, $12.1 million in depreciation, $11.4 million in service parts
lower of cost or market adjustment and $9.8 million in share-based compensation.
These non-cash expenses were partially offset by a $15.6 million non-cash gain
on debt extinguishment. Cash provided by operating activities was also due to an
$11.5 million increase in accounts payable from the timing of payments and from
increased purchases at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. In
addition, we had a $9.5 million increase in deferred revenue primarily from
prepaid license fees under an OEM agreement. 
Cash used in investing activities during
fiscal 2010 was primarily due to $8.6 million in purchases of property and
equipment. Equipment purchases were comprised of engineering, IT and marketing
equipment to support product development initiatives. We also upgraded a data
center and invested in leasehold improvements in another facility in fiscal
2010. 
Cash used in financing activities during
fiscal 2010 was primarily due to repaying $61.9 million of our senior secured
term debt. We refinanced a majority of our 4.375% convertible subordinated debt
during the first half of fiscal 2010, and repayments of these notes were offset
by borrowings of long-term debt, net, under two subordinated term loan
agreements.
Capital Resources and Financial
Condition 
We continue to focus on improving our
operating performance, including increasing revenue in higher margin areas of
the business and continuing to improve margins in an effort to return to
consistent profitability and to generate positive cash flows from operating
activities. We believe that our existing cash and capital resources will be
sufficient to meet all currently planned expenditures, debt service, contractual
obligations and sustain operations for at least the next 12 months. This belief
is dependent upon our ability to achieve revenue and gross margin projections
and to continue to control operating expenses in order to provide
positive cash flow from operating activities. Should any of the above
assumptions prove incorrect, either in combination or individually, it would
likely have a material negative effect on our cash balances and capital
resources.
36


The following is a description of our
existing capital resources including outstanding balances, funds available to
borrow, and primary repayment terms including interest rates. For additional
information, see Note 7 Long-Term Debt and Convertible Subordinated Debt to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
On March 29, 2012, we refinanced the
senior secured credit agreement with Credit Suisse (CS credit agreement) by
entering into a senior secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Capital
Finance, LLC (Wells Fargo) providing a revolving credit facility up to $75
million (WF credit agreement). The WF credit agreement matures March 29, 2017,
or August 16, 2015 if our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding on
that date. We borrowed $49.5 million on March 29, 2012 to repay all borrowings
under the CS credit agreement.
Under the WF credit agreement, we may
borrow on a revolving basis amounts to be used to refinance all debts under our
CS credit agreement as well as for general purposes. The maximum principal
amount that may be borrowed is the lesser of $75 million, reduced by $1.0
million per quarter commencing July 1, 2012, or the amount of the monthly
borrowing base. The monthly borrowing base is comprised of a cash component, an
accounts receivable component and an inventory component. We may prepay all or a
portion of any amounts borrowed without penalty or premium.
The interest rate on amounts borrowed is
based on an election by us of an annual rate equal to (1) a base rate
established by Wells Fargo plus an applicable margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on
availability levels under the WF credit agreement or (2) the LIBOR rate plus an
applicable margin ranging from 2.0% and 2.5%, based on availability levels under
the WF credit agreement. The base rate is defined in the WF credit agreement.

At March 31, 2012, we had $49.5 million
outstanding borrowings at an interest rate of 4.50%, and subsequently elected
the LIBOR rate plus applicable margin on April 5, 2012, bringing the interest
rate to 2.72%. In addition, we have letters of credit totaling $0.1 million,
reducing the amount available to borrow on the revolver to $25.4 million at
March 31, 2012. Quarterly, we are required to pay a 0.375% commitment fee on
undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility. 
The WF credit agreement contains customary
covenants, including cross-default provisions, as well as financial covenants
that require the fixed charge coverage ratio to be greater than 1.20 for the 12
month period ending on the last day of any month and average liquidity for the
most recently completed month of at least $15 million during the period
commencing on March 29, 2012 and ending on September 30, 2012, increasing to $20
million on October 1, 2012. In addition, to avoid triggering mandatory field
audits and Wells Fargo controlling our cash receipts, we must maintain average
liquidity of at least $20 million during the period commencing on March 29, 2012
and ending on September 30, 2012, increasing to $25 million on October 1, 2012.
There is also a blanket lien on all of our assets under a security agreement
with Wells Fargo. As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all
covenants.
In addition we have $135 million aggregate
principal amount of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due November 15, 2015
outstanding, the terms of which are governed by an agreement between Quantum and
U.S. Bank National Association. We are required to make semi-annual interest
payments on these notes.
Generation of positive cash flow from
operating activities has historically been, and will continue to be, an
important source of cash to fund operating needs and meet our current and
long-term obligations. We have taken many actions in recent years to offset the
negative impact of the recession and slow economic recovery and their impact on
the data protection and big data and archive markets. We cannot provide
assurance that the actions we have taken in the past or any actions we may take
in the future will ensure a consistent, sustainable and sufficient level of net
income and positive cash flow from operating activities to fund, sustain or grow
our business. Certain events that are beyond our control, including prevailing
economic, competitive and industry conditions, as well as various legal and
other disputes, may prevent us from achieving these financial objectives. Any
inability to achieve consistent and sustainable net income and cash flow could
result in:


(i)
      
Restrictions on our ability to
      manage or fund our existing operations, which could result in a material
      and adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
      condition.

 

(ii)
      
Unwillingness on the part of
      Wells Fargo to do any of the following:
Provide a waiver or amendment for any covenant
  violations we may experience in future periods, thereby triggering a default under, or termination of, the revolving
  credit line, or
Approve any amendments to the credit agreement we
  may seek to obtain in the future. 
37






Any lack of renewal, waiver,
      or amendment, if needed, could result in the revolving credit line
      becoming unavailable to us and any amounts outstanding becoming
      immediately due and payable. In the case of our borrowings at March 31,
      2012, this would mean $49.5 million could become immediately
      payable.



 

(iii)
    
      
Further impairment of our
      financial flexibility, which could require us to raise additional funding
      in the capital markets sooner than we otherwise would, and on terms less
      favorable to us, if available at all.
Any of the above mentioned items,
individually or in combination, could have a material and adverse effect on our
results of operations, available cash and cash flows, financial condition,
access to capital and liquidity.
Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements 
Lease Commitments 
We lease certain facilities under
non-cancelable lease agreements. Some of the leases have renewal options ranging
from one to ten years and others contain escalation clauses and provisions for
maintenance, taxes or insurance. We also have equipment leases for computers and
other office equipment. Future minimum lease payments under these operating
leases are shown below in the Contractual Obligations section. 
Commitments to Purchase Inventory

We use contract manufacturers for certain
manufacturing functions. Under these arrangements, the contract manufacturer
procures inventory to manufacture products based upon our forecast of customer
demand. We have similar arrangements with certain other suppliers. We are
responsible for the financial impact on the supplier of any reduction or product
mix shift in the forecast relative to materials that the supplier had already
purchased under a prior forecast. Such a variance in forecasted demand could
require a cash payment for inventory in excess of current customer demand or for
costs of excess or obsolete inventory. As of March 31, 2012, we had issued
non-cancelable purchase commitments for $34.3 million to purchase inventory from
our suppliers. 
Stock Repurchases 
As of March 31, 2012, there was $87.9
million remaining under our authorization to repurchase Quantum common stock. No
stock repurchases were made during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010. Our ability to repurchase our common stock is restricted unless we
meet certain thresholds under the terms of the WF credit agreement.

As of March 31, 2012, we had $5.2 million
of long-term tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, for which we cannot
make a reasonably reliable estimate of when payments are likely to occur.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND
POLICIES 
Our discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations is based on the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these
statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments about future
uncertainties that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our
significant accounting policies are presented within Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates require the most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are described below. An
accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain when the estimate is made, if
different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the
estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial
statements. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our
critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
We believe the assumptions and estimates used and the resulting balances are
reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 
Revenue Recognition 
Application of the various accounting
principles related to measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make
judgments and estimates in the following related areas: determining estimated
selling prices (ESP) and allocating revenue based on the relative selling
prices in arrangements with multiple deliverables, including assessing whether
we have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third-party evidence of
selling price (TPE) for each deliverable; the interpretation of non-standard
terms and conditions in sales agreements; assessments of future price
adjustments, such as rebates, price protection and future product returns and
estimates for contractual licensee fees.
When we enter into sales arrangements with
customers that contain multiple deliverables such as hardware, software and
services, these arrangements require us to identify each deliverable and
determine its ESP following the relative selling price hierarchy. Additionally,
we sometimes use judgment in order to determine the appropriate timing of
revenue recognition and to assess whether any software and nonsoftware
components function together to deliver a tangible products essential
functionality in order to ensure the arrangement is properly accounted for as
software or hardware revenue.
When we enter into multiple deliverable
revenue arrangements with customers which are not subject to software revenue
guidance, we use judgment to (1) separate the deliverables based on specific
criteria, (2) assign an estimated selling price to each deliverable based on the
selling price hierarchy using VSOE, TPE or ESP and (3) allocate the total
arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. When VSOE
cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element
based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for largely
interchangeable products when sold separately. When we are unable to establish
selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP. We use judgment to determine ESP,
which is the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service
were regularly sold on a standalone basis. In this determination we consider our
discounting and internal pricing practices, external market conditions and
competitive positioning for similar offerings. 
While the majority of our sales
arrangements contain standard terms and conditions, we sometimes apply judgment
when interpreting complex arrangements with non-standard terms and conditions to
determine the appropriate accounting and timing of revenue recognition. An
example of such a judgment is deferring revenue related to significant
post-delivery obligations and customer acceptance criteria until such
obligations are fulfilled.
We license certain software to customers
under licensing agreements that allow those customers to embed the software into
specific products they offer. As consideration, licensees pay us a fee based on
the amount of sales of their products that incorporate our software. On a
periodic and timely basis, the licensees provide us with reports listing their
sales to end users for which they owe us license fees. Similarly, royalty
revenue is estimated from licensee reports of units sold to end users subject to
royalties under master contracts. In both cases, these reports are used to
substantiate delivery and we recognize revenue based on the information in these
reports or when amounts can be reasonably estimated.
39


Inventory Allowances 
Our manufacturing and service parts
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a
first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Adjustments to reduce the carrying value of
both manufacturing and service parts inventories to their net realizable value
are made for estimated excess, obsolete or impaired balances. Factors
influencing these adjustments include significant estimates and judgments about
the future of product life cycles, product demand, rapid technological changes,
development plans, product pricing, physical deterioration, quality issues, end
of service life plans and volume of enhanced or extended warranty service
contracts.
Fair Value of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination 
We use judgment when applying the various
accounting principles to measure the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination. There are matters that are
inherently uncertain when making estimates used to determine fair value where
there are not active markets for these assets and liabilities. In addition,
different estimates reasonably could be used and changes in the estimate that
are reasonably possible could materially impact the resulting valuation and the
financial statements. For example, judgments have been required to determine
fair values of amortizable intangible assets, in-process research and
development and the resulting amount of goodwill. Significant estimates and
assumptions we make to estimate fair value of these acquired assets include:

Planned product roadmaps, including the primary
  feature sets of new products;
Expected efforts and associated costs required to
  integrate technologies acquired into new products;
Assessed importance of in-process research and
  development to our overall development plan;
Estimated values and rates of a market
  participant;
Estimated future cash flows of current and future
  products; and
Estimated discount rate applied to future cash
  flows. 
In addition, the estimated future life of
purchased technology intangibles impacts future financial statements. We believe
the assumptions and estimates used and the resulting fair values are reasonable.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets and
Goodwill 
We apply judgment when reviewing
amortizable intangible and other long-lived assets (long-lived assets) and
goodwill for impairment, including when evaluating potential impairment
indicators. Indicators we consider include adverse changes in the business
climate that could affect the value of our long-lived assets or goodwill,
changes in our stock price and resulting market capitalization relative to book
value, changes in our business strategy, product mix or to the long-term
economic outlook, decreases or slower than expected growth in sales of products,
relative weakness in customer channels and, in the case of goodwill, testing
long-lived assets for recoverability. 
We use an undiscounted cash flow approach
to evaluate our long-lived assets for recoverability when there are impairment
indicators. Estimates of future cash flows require significant judgments about
the future and include company forecasts and our expectations of future use of
our long-lived assets, both of which may be impacted by market conditions. Other
critical estimates include determining the asset group or groups within our
long-lived assets, the primary asset of an asset group and the primary assets
useful life.
During fiscal 2012, we early adopted the
accounting guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment calculation is necessary.
As a result, we may perform a qualitative test, a quantitative test, or both for
the annual goodwill impairment assessment. For our annual goodwill impairment
testing, or if a goodwill impairment indicator exists in an interim period, we
compare the fair value of the company to its carrying value. Estimates to
determine the fair value of the company require significant judgment. If the
results indicate our fair value is less than our carrying value then a second
step must be performed to quantify the amount of goodwill impairment, requiring
additional assumptions and judgments.
The following assumptions and estimates
may be used by management when the income approach is used in the second step of
a goodwill impairment test. We derive discounted cash flows using estimates and
assumptions about the future. Other significant assumptions may include:
expected future revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, working capital
levels, asset lives used to generate future cash flows, a discount rate, a
terminal value multiple, income tax rates and utilization of net operating loss
tax carryforwards. These assumptions are developed using current market
conditions as well as internal projections. Inherent in
our development of cash flow projections for the income approach used in an
impairment test are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our
operating results, approved business plans, expected growth, cost of capital and
income tax rates. We also make certain assumptions about future economic
conditions, applicable interest rates and other market data.
40


Accrued Warranty 
We estimate future product failure rates
based upon historical product failure trends as well as anticipated future
failure rates if believed to be significantly different from historical trends.
Similarly, we estimate future costs of repair based upon historical trends and
anticipated future costs if they are expected to significantly differ, for
example due to negotiated agreements with third parties. We use a consistent
model and exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying
estimates. Our model requires an element of subjectivity for all of our
products. For example, historical return rates are not completely indicative of
future return rates and we must therefore exercise judgment with respect to
future deviations from our historical return rates. When actual failure rates
differ significantly from our estimates, we record the impact in subsequent
periods and update our assumptions and forecasting models accordingly. As our
newer products mature, we are able to improve our estimates with respect to
these products.
Income Taxes 
A number of estimates and judgments are
necessary to determine deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and
valuation allowances. We
recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not
that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical
merits of the tax position. The calculation of our tax liabilities requires
judgment related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have
to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on
factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances,
changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit
activity.
We have provided a full valuation
allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets due to our history of net
losses, difficulty in predicting future results and our conclusion that we
cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize the deferred tax
assets. In addition, we have provided a full valuation allowance against certain
of our international net deferred tax assets. Due to reorganizations in these
jurisdictions, it is unclear whether we will be able to realize a benefit from
these deferred tax assets. Also, certain changes in stock ownership could result
in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers
that can be utilized each year. Should we undergo such a change in stock
ownership, it would severely limit the usage of these carryover tax attributes
against future income, resulting in additional tax charges.
Significant management judgment is
required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation
allowances for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit
from our net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance
until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation
allowance. Future income tax expense will be reduced to the extent that we have
sufficient evidence to support a reversal or decrease in this allowance. We also
have deferred tax assets and liabilities due to prior business acquisitions with
corresponding valuation allowances after assessing our ability to realize any
future benefit from these acquired net deferred tax assets.
41


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
Our financial instruments are exposed to
changes in market interest rates. 
Market Interest Rate
Risk 
Changes in interest rates affect interest
income earned on our cash equivalents. In addition, changes in interest rates
affect interest expense on our borrowings under the WF credit agreement and
affected interest expense on borrowings under the CS credit agreement while
outstanding. Our outstanding convertible subordinated notes have a fixed
interest rate, thus a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates
would not impact interest expense on these borrowings.
Our cash equivalents consisted solely of
money market funds at March 31, 2012 and 2011. During fiscal 2012 and fiscal
2011, interest rates on these funds were under 1.0%. A hypothetical decrease in
interest rates would have caused an immaterial decrease in interest income for
fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.
Interest accrued on our CS credit
agreement at our option, based on either, a prime rate plus a margin of 2.5%, or
a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.5%. Interest rate on amounts borrowed on our WF
credit agreement is based on an election by us of an annual rate equal to (1) a
base rate established by Wells Fargo plus an applicable margin of 1.0% to 1.5%,
based on availability levels under the WF credit agreement or (2) the LIBOR rate
plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.0% and 2.5%, based on availability
levels under the WF credit agreement. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in
interest rates would increase interest expense $0.2 million and $0.4 million for
fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Quantum Corporation: 
In our opinion, the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statement of
operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Quantum Corporation and its
subsidiaries at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2012 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

QUANTUM CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Quantum Corporation (Quantum, the
Company, us or we), founded in 1980, is a global expert in data protection
and big data management. We provide solutions for storing and protecting
information in physical, virtual, cloud and big data environments that are
designed to help customers be certain they are maximizing the value of their
data over its entire lifecycle. With our solutions, customers can better adapt
in a world of continuing change by keeping and protecting more data for a longer
period of time while reducing costs and increasing return on investment. We work closely
with a broad network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), direct
marketing resellers (DMRs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and
other suppliers to meet customers evolving data protection and big data
management needs. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol QTM.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Quantum and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. On
June 13, 2011, we acquired Pancetera Software, Inc. (Pancetera), and
Panceteras results of operations are included in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations from that date. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S.
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses during the period. We base estimates on
historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are
believed to be reasonable based on available information. Our reported financial
position or results of operations may be materially different under different
conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with
respect to significant accounting policies, which are discussed below. In the
event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results,
adjustments are made in the current period to reflect this current information.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue consists of sales of hardware,
software and services, as well as royalties we earn for the license of certain
intellectual property. Revenue is recognized from the sale of products and
services when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered
realized and earned when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered; the price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable; and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Royalty revenue is
recognized when earned or amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Product Revenue 
Hardware
Revenue for hardware products sold to
distributors, VARs, DMRs, OEMs and end users is generally recognized upon
shipment. When significant post-delivery obligations exist, the related revenue
is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. If there are customer
acceptance criteria in the contract, we recognize revenue upon end user
acceptance, which typically occurs after delivery and installation are
completed.
In the period revenue is recognized,
allowances are provided for estimated future price adjustments, such as rebates,
price protection and future product returns. These allowances are based on
programs in existence at the time revenue is recognized, plans regarding future
price adjustments, the customers master agreements and historical product
return rates. Since we have historically been able to reliably estimate the
amount of allowances required, we recognize revenue, net of projected
allowances, upon shipment to our customers. If we were unable to reliably
estimate the amount of revenue adjustments in any specific reporting period,
then we would be required to defer recognition of the revenue until the rights
had lapsed and we were no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or
accept the return of the product.
50 


Product Revenue 
Software
Software revenue is generally recognized
upon shipment or electronic delivery and when vendor-specific objective evidence
(VSOE) of fair value for undelivered elements exists. For software
arrangements with multiple elements, the residual method is used to determine
the amount of product revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, the
VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining
portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as product revenue,
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria of appropriate revenue guidance
have been met. Revenue from post-contract customer support agreements, which
entitle customers to both telephone support and any unspecified upgrades and
enhancements during the term of the agreement, is recognized ratably over the
term of the support agreement.
We license certain software to customers
under licensing agreements that allow those customers to embed our software into
specific products they offer. As consideration, licensees pay us a fee based on
the amount of sales of their products that incorporate our software. On a
periodic and timely basis, the licensees provide us with reports listing their
sales to end users for which they owe us license fees. As the reports
substantiate delivery has occurred, we recognize revenue based on the
information in these reports or when amounts can be reasonably
estimated.
Service Revenue
Revenue for service is generally
recognized upon services being rendered. Service revenue consists of customer
field support agreements for our hardware products, installation, professional
services and out-of-warranty repairs. For customer field support agreements,
revenue equal to the separately stated price of these service contracts for our
hardware products is initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over
the contract period. Installation and professional services are not considered
essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter
the product capabilities, do not require specialized skills and may be performed
by our customers or other vendors. Installation and professional services are
recognized upon completion. Out-of-warranty repair revenue is recognized upon
completion of the repair. 
Royalty Revenue
We license certain intellectual property
to third party manufacturers under arrangements that are represented by master
contracts. The master contracts give the third party manufacturers rights to the
intellectual property which include allowing them to either manufacture or
include the intellectual property in products for resale. As consideration, the
licensees pay us a per-unit royalty for sales of their products that incorporate
our intellectual property. On a periodic and timely basis, the licensees provide
us with reports listing units sold to end users subject to the royalties. As the
reports substantiate delivery has occurred, we recognize revenue based on the
information in these reports or when amounts can be reasonably
estimated.
Multiple Element
Arrangements 
For multiple deliverable revenue
arrangements with customers which are not subject to software revenue guidance,
we separate the deliverables based on specific criteria, assign an estimated
selling price to each deliverable based on the selling price hierarchy using
VSOE, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) or estimated selling price
(ESP) and allocate the total arrangement consideration using the relative
selling price method. When VSOE cannot be established we attempt to establish
the selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on
competitor prices for largely interchangeable products when sold separately.
When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP. For
ESP, we consider our discounting and internal pricing practices. Additionally,
for certain transactions we evaluate whether any undelivered elements are
essential to the functionality of the delivered elements in order to determine
the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. If specific criteria are not met,
the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which results in
revenue being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met, when the
last undelivered element is delivered or ratably over the contract term as
appropriate. 
Service Cost of Revenue

We classify expenses as service cost of
revenue by estimating the portion of our total cost of revenue that relates to
providing field support to our customers under contract, installation,
integration and repair services. These estimates are based upon a variety of
factors, including the nature of the support activity and the level of
infrastructure required to support the activities from which we earn service
revenue. In the event our service business changes, our estimates of cost of
service revenue may be impacted. Service cost of revenue excludes costs
associated with basic warranty support on new products.
51 


Shipping and Handling Fees

Shipping and handling fees are included in
cost of revenue and were $20.3 million, $22.2 million and $26.1 million in
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Research and Development Costs

Expenditures relating to the development
of new products and processes are expensed as incurred. These costs include
expenditures for employee compensation, materials used in the development
effort, other internal costs, as well as expenditures for third party
professional services. We have determined that technological feasibility for our
software products is reached shortly before the products are released to
manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established
have not been material. We expense software-related research and development
costs as incurred. 
Advertising Expense 
We expense advertising costs as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $4.3
million, $5.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. 
Restructuring Charges

In recent periods and over the past
several years, we have recorded significant restructuring charges related to the
realignment and restructuring of our business operations. These charges
represent expenses incurred in connection with strategic planning, certain cost
reduction programs and acquisition integrations that we have implemented and
consist of the cost of involuntary termination benefits, facilities charges,
asset write-offs and other costs of exiting activities or geographies.

The charges for involuntary termination
costs and associated expenses often require the use of estimates, primarily
related to the number of employees to be paid severance and the amounts to be
paid, largely based on years of service and statutory requirements. Assumptions
to estimate facility exit costs include the ability to secure sublease income
largely based on market conditions, the likelihood and amounts of a negotiated
settlement for contractual lease obligations and other exit costs. Other
estimates for restructuring charges consist of the realizable value of assets
including associated disposal costs and termination fees with third parties for
other contractual commitments. 
Share-Based Compensation

We account for share-based compensation
using the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model to estimate the fair value of
share-based awards at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes model requires the
use of highly subjective assumptions, including expected life, expected
volatility and expected risk-free rate of return. Other reasonable assumptions
could provide differing results. We calculate a forfeiture rate to estimate the
share-based awards that will ultimately vest based on types of awards and
historical experience. Additionally, for awards which are performance based, we
make estimates as to the probability of the underlying performance being
achieved.
Foreign Currency Translation and
Transactions 
Assets, liabilities and operations of
foreign offices and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency
of the entity. For a majority of our foreign operations, the functional currency
is the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of foreign offices with a local
functional currency are translated, for consolidation purposes, at current
exchange rates from the local currency to the reporting currency, the U.S.
dollar. The resulting gains or losses are reported as a component of other
comprehensive income. Foreign exchange gains and losses from changes in the
exchange rates underlying intercompany balances that are of a long-term
investment nature are also reported as a component of other comprehensive
income. Assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency
are remeasured each month with the remeasurement gain or loss recorded in other
income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign
currency gains and losses recorded in other income and
expense were a $0.1 million loss in fiscal 2012, a $0.3 million gain in fiscal
2011 and a $0.6 million loss in fiscal 2010.
52 



Income Taxes 
We recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities due to the effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. We also reduce deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized.
We recognize the benefit from a tax
position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained
upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The
calculation of our tax liabilities requires judgment related to uncertainties in
the application of complex tax regulations. It is inherently difficult and
subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of
various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a
quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited
to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled
issues under audit and new audit activity. A change in recognition or
measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional
tax charge to the provision. 
We recognize interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. To the extent accrued interest and
penalties do not become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected
as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such
determination is made. 
Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and
Other Investments 
We consider all highly liquid debt
instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at fair value, which approximates
their cost. 
Restricted cash is comprised of bank
guarantees and similar required minimum balances that serve as cash collateral in connection with various items including
insurance requirements, value added taxes, ongoing tax audits and leases in
certain countries. 
We also hold investments in private
technology venture limited partnerships. These investments individually
represent voting ownership interests of less than 20%. Ownership interests in
these limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity method unless our
interest is so minor (typically less than 5%) that we have virtually no
influence over the partnership operating and financial policies, in which case
the cost method is used. Currently, our investments in these limited
partnerships are accounted for using the equity method. 
Investments in other privately held
companies are accounted for under the cost method unless we hold a significant
stake. We review non-marketable equity investments on a regular basis to
determine if there has been any impairment of value which is other than
temporary by reviewing their financial information, gaining knowledge of any new
financing or other business agreements and assessing their operating viability.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers financial condition and, for the majority of our customers,
require no collateral. For customers that do not meet our credit standards, we
often require a form of collateral, such as cash deposits or letters of credit
prior to the completion of a transaction. These credit evaluations require
significant judgment and are based on multiple sources of information. We
analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experience, industry and
geographic concentrations of credit risk, current economic trends and changes in
customer payment terms. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
historical experience and expected collectibility of outstanding accounts
receivable. We record bad debt expense in general and administrative expenses.

Manufacturing Inventories

Our manufacturing inventory is stated at
the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out
(FIFO) basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of manufacturing inventory to its
net realizable value, if required, are made for estimated excess, obsolete or
impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include declines in
demand, rapid technological changes, product life cycle and development plans,
component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality
issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ
from our estimates. 
53


Service Parts Inventories

Our service parts inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or market. We carry service parts because we generally
provide product warranty for 1 to 3 years and earn revenue by providing enhanced
and extended warranty and repair service during and beyond this warranty period.
Service parts inventories consist of both component parts, which are primarily
used to repair defective units, and finished units, which are provided for
customer use permanently or on a temporary basis while the defective unit is
being repaired. Defective parts returned from customers that can be repaired are
repaired and put back into service parts inventories at their fair value. We
record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of service parts inventory to
its net realizable value, and we dispose of parts with a net realizable value of
zero. Factors influencing these adjustments include product life cycles, end of
service life plans and volume of enhanced or extended warranty service
contracts. Estimates of net realizable value involve significant estimates and
judgments about the future, and revisions would be required if these factors
differ from our estimates. 
Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:



Machinery and equipment
3 to 5 years

Computer equipment
3 to 5 years

ERP software
10 years

Other software
3 years

Furniture and fixtures
5 years

Other office equipment

Amortizable Intangible and Other
Long-lived Assets 
We review amortizable intangible and other
long-lived assets (long-lived assets) for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. The company operates as a single reporting unit for business and
operating purposes, and our impairment evaluation also treats the company as a
single reporting unit. Impairment indicators we consider include adverse changes
in the business climate that could affect the value of our long-lived assets,
changes in our stock price and resulting market capitalization relative to book
value, downward revisions in our revenue outlook, decreases or slower than
expected growth in sales of products and relative weakness in customer channels.
If we indentify impairment indicators, we evaluate recoverability using an
undiscounted cash flow approach. Estimates of future cash flows incorporate
company forecasts and our expectations of future use of our long-lived assets,
and these factors are impacted by market conditions. If impairment is indicated,
an impairment charge is recorded to write the long-lived assets down to their
estimated fair value.
Goodwill 
We evaluate goodwill for impairment
annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently when
indicators of impairment are present. During fiscal 2012, we early adopted the
accounting guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether a quantitative calculation is necessary. As a result, we may
perform a qualitative test, a quantitative test, or both for the annual
impairment assessment. Some of the impairment indicators we consider include
changes in our stock price and resulting market capitalization relative to book
value, changes in the business climate, business strategy or product mix,
changes to the long-term economic outlook and testing long-lived assets for
recoverability. We operate as a single reporting unit and consider the company
as a whole when reviewing these factors. If impairment is indicated, a goodwill
impairment charge is recorded to write the goodwill down to its implied fair
value.
54


Accrued Warranty 
We generally warrant our hardware products
against defects for periods ranging from 1 to 3 years from the date of sale. Our
tape automation systems and disk systems may carry service agreements with
customers that choose to extend or upgrade the warranty service. We provide
repair services from our facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado as well as
multiple third party providers inside and outside of the U.S. We use a
combination of internal resources and third party service providers to supply
field service and support. We continue to evaluate repair sites, and any
resulting actions taken may affect the future costs of repair. If the actual
costs were to differ significantly from our estimates, we would record the
impact of these unforeseen costs or cost reductions in subsequent
periods.
We estimate future failure rates based
upon historical product failure trends as well as anticipated future failure
rates if believed to be significantly different from historical trends.
Similarly, we estimate future costs of repair based upon historical trends and
anticipated future costs if they are expected to significantly differ, for
example due to negotiated agreements with third parties. We use a consistent
model and exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying
estimates. Our model requires an element of subjectivity for all of our
products. For example, historical rates of return are not completely indicative
of future return rates and we must therefore exercise judgment with respect to
future deviations from our historical return rate. When actual failure rates
differ significantly from our estimates, we record the impact in subsequent
periods and update our assumptions and forecasting models accordingly. As our
newer products mature, we are able to improve our estimates with respect to
these products. It is reasonably likely that assumptions will be updated for
failure rates and, therefore, our accrued warranty estimate could change in the
future. 
Business
Combinations 
We allocate the purchase price paid to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their
estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess purchase price
above the identified net tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities
is allocated to goodwill. We consider fair value to be the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We estimate
fair value using the fair value hierarchy for the tangible and intangible assets
acquired as well as liabilities and contingencies assumed from the acquired
company. 
Derivative Financial Instruments

We recognize all derivatives, whether
designated in hedging relationships or not, on the balance sheet at fair value.
If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair
value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If the
derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
Derivatives not designated or qualifying as a hedging instrument are adjusted to
fair value through earnings. We may, from time to time, enter into derivative
instruments to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.
Common Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2000, the Board of Directors
authorized us to repurchase up to $700 million of our common stock in open
market or private transactions. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, there was $87.9
million remaining on our authorization to repurchase Quantum common stock. Our
ability to repurchase our common stock is restricted unless we meet certain
thresholds under the terms of the Wells Fargo credit agreement (WF credit
agreement). 
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
We use exit prices, that is the price to
sell an asset or transfer a liability, to measure assets and liabilities that
are within the scope of the fair value measurements guidance. We classify these
assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy: 


Level 1:
Quoted (observable) market
      prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:  
      
Observable inputs other than Level 1,
      such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
      markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
      corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
      the asset or liability.

Level 3:
Prices or valuations that
      require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
      unobservable.
55


The assets measured and recorded at fair
value on a recurring basis consist of money market funds which are valued using

We have certain non-financial assets that
are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when there is an indicator
of impairment, and they are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is
recognized. These assets include property and equipment, amortizable intangible
assets, in-process research and development (IPR&D) and goodwill. We did
not record impairments to any non-financial assets in fiscal 2012 or fiscal
2011. We do not have any non-financial liabilities measured and recorded at fair
value on a non-recurring basis. 
We have financial liabilities for which we
are obligated to repay the carrying value, unless the holder agrees to a lesser
amount. The carrying value and fair value of these financial liabilities were as

Risks and Uncertainties

As is typical in the information storage
industry, a significant portion of our customer base is concentrated among a
small number of OEMs, distributors and large VARs. The loss of any one of our
more significant customers, or a significant decrease in the sales volume with
one of these significant customers, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if there is a
downturn in general economic conditions, the resulting effect on IT spending
could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. We also face risks and uncertainties since our competitors
in one area may be customers or suppliers in another. 
A limited number of products comprise a
significant majority of our sales, and due to increasingly rapid technological
change in the industry, our future operating results depend on our ability to
develop and successfully introduce new products. 
Concentration of Credit Risk

We currently invest our excess cash in
deposits with major banks and in money market funds. In the past, we have also
held investments in short-term debt securities of companies with strong credit
ratings from a variety of industries, and we may make investments in these
securities in the future. We have not experienced any material losses on these
investments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and to any
one type of investment. 
We sell products to customers in a wide
variety of industries on a worldwide basis. In countries or industries where we
are exposed to material credit risk, we may require collateral, including cash
deposits and letters of credit prior to the completion of a transaction. We do
not believe we have significant credit risk beyond that provided for in the
financial statements in the ordinary course of business. 
56


Sales to our top five customers
represented 34% of revenue in fiscal 2012 compared to 33% of revenue in fiscal
2011 and 37% of revenue in fiscal 2010. We had no customers that comprised 10%
or greater of revenue in fiscal 2012. Sales to our largest customer, Dell Inc.
(Dell), were 10% of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to 13% of revenue in
fiscal 2010.
Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements
In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we
adopted the goodwill impairment guidance for reporting units with zero or
negative carrying amounts. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on
our financial position or results of operations.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we
adopted the guidance for disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for
business combinations. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our
financial position or results of operations, other than the additional
disclosures included in the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we
early adopted the guidance regarding the presentation of other comprehensive
income. We elected to present other comprehensive income in two separate but
consecutive statements of net income and its components followed immediately by
a statement of other comprehensive income (loss). Adoption of this standard did
not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations, other
than the additional statement in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we
early adopted the guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative
assessment for step one goodwill impairment testing. Adoption of this standard
did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments
to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S.
GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04), which amends
the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures. ASU
2011-04 provides clarifications about the application of existing fair value
measurement and disclosure requirements. In addition, ASU 2011-04 changes how to
measure fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio and how
to apply premiums and discounts. There are also additional disclosures required.
ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We will apply this standard beginning
in fiscal 2013 and do not anticipate adoption will impact our statements of
financial position or results of operations. 
NOTE 3: ACQUISITION 
On June 13, 2011, in order to enhance our
product offerings and technology portfolio we acquired Pancetera pursuant to a
statutory merger in exchange for approximately $11.0 million, comprised of $8.2
million in cash and $2.8 million in Quantum common stock. We acquired all
outstanding shares of Pancetera and assumed all of Panceteras outstanding
unvested stock options according to the option exchange ratio defined in the
merger agreement with Pancetera. We also assumed unvested restricted Pancetera
common stock in accordance with the merger agreement. Panceteras results of
operations are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash
Flows from the June 13, 2011 acquisition date.
The acquisition was recorded under the
acquisition method of accounting, resulting in the purchase price being
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. The allocation of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed is set forth below (in thousands):

In performing our purchase
price allocation, we considered, among other factors, our intention for future
use of acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance and
estimates of future performance of Panceteras existing and future products. The
fair value of current assets, property and equipment and current liabilities was
based on market prices at the acquisition date. The fair value of amortizable
intangible assets and IPR&D was based, in part, on a valuation using a
discounted cash flow approach and other valuation techniques as well as
managements estimates and assumptions.
The amortizable intangible
assets are all related to developed technology and are included in purchased
technology within Note 5 Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Purchased technology,
which comprises products that have reached technological feasibility, was
primarily related to SmartRead®. SmartRead is patented technology,
primarily comprised of a set of algorithms that reduce storage input-output when
performing maintenance tasks such as backup, replication or migration of virtual
machines. Pancetera products containing the SmartRead technology included
SmartView TM and SmartMotion TM, which have been rebranded
as vmPRO software solutions. Purchased technology intangible assets also include
a combination of Pancetera processes, patents and trade secrets related to the
design and development of these products. This proprietary know-how can be
leveraged to develop new technology and improve our products. The SmartRead
purchased technology intangible asset has an amortization period of four
years.
IPR&D represents
incomplete Pancetera research and development projects that had not reached
technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Due to the nature of
IPR&D, the expected life is indeterminate and we periodically evaluate for
attainment of technological feasibility or impairment. Technological feasibility
is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding
and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be
produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features and
technical performance requirements. The value assigned to IPR&D was
determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall
development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the
projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows using a discount rate
of 18% to their present value based on the percentage of completion of the
IPR&D projects.
The goodwill as a result of
this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In addition,
we incurred acquisition expenses of $0.3 million during fiscal 2012 which are
included in general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents

NOTE 5: INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND
GOODWILL
Intangible Assets 
Acquired intangible assets are amortized
over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from one to eight
years. In estimating the useful lives of intangible assets, we considered the
following factors: 
The cash flow projections used to estimate the
  useful lives of the intangible assets showed a trend of growth that was expected to continue for an extended period of
  time;
Our tape automation products, disk systems and
  software, in particular, have long development cycles; these products have experienced long product life cycles;
  and
Our ability to leverage core technology into data
  protection and big data and archive solutions and, therefore, to extend the lives of these technologies. 
Acquired IPR&D is amortized over its
estimated useful life once technological feasibility is reached. If IPR&D is
determined to not have technological feasibility or is abandoned, we write off
the IPR&D in that period.
Following is the weighted average
amortization period for our amortizable intangible assets:

We warrant our products
      against defects for 1 to 3 years. A provision for estimated future costs
      and estimated returns for credit relating to warranty is recorded when
      products are shipped and revenue recognized. Our estimate of future costs
      to satisfy warranty obligations is primarily based on historical trends
      and, if believed to be significantly different from historical trends,
      estimates of future failure rates and future costs of repair. Future costs
      of repair include materials consumed in the repair, labor and overhead
      amounts necessary to perform the repair. If future actual failure rates
      differ from our estimates, we record the impact in subsequent periods. If
      future actual costs of repair were to differ significantly from our
      estimates, we would record the impact of these unforeseen cost differences
      in subsequent periods.

Long-Term Debt
Wells Fargo Credit
Agreement 
On March 29, 2012, we refinanced the
senior secured credit agreement with Credit Suisse (CS credit agreement) by
entering into a senior secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Capital
Finance, LLC (Wells Fargo) providing a revolving credit facility up to $75
million (WF credit agreement). The WF credit agreement matures March 29, 2017,
or August 16, 2015 if our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding on
that date. We borrowed $49.5 million on March 29, 2012 to repay all borrowings
under the CS credit agreement. Amounts borrowed are included in long-term debt
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We incurred and capitalized $1.0 million of
fees related to the WF credit agreement which are included in other long-term
assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These fees are being amortized to
interest expense over the term of the WF credit agreement. 
Under the WF credit agreement, we may
borrow on a revolving basis amounts to be used to refinance all debts under our
CS credit agreement as well as for general purposes. The maximum principal
amount that may be borrowed is the lesser of $75 million, reduced by $1.0
million per quarter commencing July 1, 2012, or the amount of the monthly
borrowing base. The monthly borrowing base is comprised of a cash component, an
accounts receivable component and an inventory component. We may prepay all or a
portion of any amounts borrowed without penalty or premium.
The interest rate on amounts borrowed is
based on an election by us of an annual rate equal to (1) a base rate
established by Wells Fargo plus an applicable margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on
availability levels under the WF credit agreement or (2) the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin
ranging from 2.0% and 2.5%, based on availability levels under the WF credit
agreement.
61



At March 31, 2012, we had $49.5 million
outstanding borrowings at an interest rate of 4.50%, and subsequently elected
the LIBOR rate plus applicable margin on April 5, 2012, bringing the interest
rate to 2.72%. In addition, we have letters of credit totaling $0.1 million,
reducing the amounts available to borrow on the revolver to $25.4 million at
March 31, 2012. Quarterly, we are required to pay a 0.375% commitment fee on
undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility. 
The WF credit agreement contains customary
covenants, including cross-default provisions, as well as financial covenants
that require the fixed charge coverage ratio to be greater than 1.20 for the 12
month period ending on the last day of any month and average liquidity for the
most recently completed month of at least $15 million during the period
commencing on March 29, 2012 and ending on September 30, 2012, increasing to $20
million on October 1, 2012. In addition, to avoid triggering mandatory field
audits and Wells Fargo controlling our cash receipts, we must maintain average
liquidity of at least $20 million during the period commencing on March 29, 2012
and ending on September 30, 2012, increasing to $25 million on October 1, 2012.
Both the fixed charge coverage ratio and average liquidity are defined in the WF
credit agreement. There is also a blanket lien on all of our assets under a
security agreement with Wells Fargo. As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance
with all covenants. 
Credit Suisse Credit
Agreement 
On July 12, 2007, we refinanced a prior
credit facility by entering into a senior secured credit agreement with Credit
Suisse providing a $50 million revolving credit facility and a $400 million
senior secured term loan. We borrowed $400 million on the term loan to repay all
borrowings under a prior credit facility used to fund the Advanced Digital
Information Corporation acquisition. We incurred and capitalized $8.1 million of
loan fees related to the CS credit agreement which were included in other
long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These fees were amortized
to interest expense over the respective loan terms. Interest accrued on the term
loan at our option based on either, a prime rate plus a margin of 2.5%, or a
LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.5%. During fiscal 2011, we made principal
payments of $81.7 million on the CS credit agreement term loan, and in fiscal
2012 we made principal payments of $104.3 million to fully extinguish the term
loan and CS credit agreement.
Subordinated Term Loans 
On November 15, 2010, we paid $121.7
million plus $1.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest to settle subordinated
term loans with EMC International Company. As a result of the voluntary
prepayment in full of these term loans, we have satisfied all of our obligations
under these loans. We funded this payment using proceeds from the 3.50%
convertible subordinated notes. 
Convertible Subordinated Debt

Current Notes Issued November
2010 
On November 15, 2010, we issued $135
million aggregate principal amount of the current notes due November 15, 2015
(current notes) with a conversion price of $4.33 per share of our common
stock. We may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity date although
investors may convert the current notes into Quantum common stock until November
14, 2015 at their option. In addition, since purchasers are qualified
institutional investors, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933
(Securities Act), the current notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act. We pay 3.50% interest per annum on the principal amount of the
current notes semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The terms of
the current notes are governed by an agreement dated November 15, 2010 between
Quantum and U.S. Bank National Association. The current notes are subordinated
to any existing indebtedness and other liabilities.
We incurred and capitalized $5.0 million
of loan fees in fiscal 2011 for the current notes which are included in other
long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These fees are amortized to
interest expense over the loan term. 
62


4.375% Notes Issued July
2003 
On July 30, 2010, we paid $22.1 million
plus $0.5 million in accrued and unpaid interest to redeem the 4.375%
convertible subordinated notes outstanding at that date in accordance with the
contractual terms at maturity. These notes matured August 1,
2010. 
Gain (Loss) on Debt Extinguishment, Net
of Costs 
In fiscal 2012, in connection with fully
extinguishing the CS term loan and credit agreement on March 29, 2012, we wrote
off $2.3 million of unamortized debt costs related to the CS term loan and
credit agreement.
In fiscal 2011, in connection with the
repayment of our subordinated term loans on November 15, 2010, we wrote off $1.2
million of unamortized debt costs related to these term loans. 
In fiscal 2010, in connection with a
tender offer and a private transaction for the 4.375% convertible subordinated
notes issued July 2003, we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment, net of costs,
of $12.9 million comprised of a gross gain of $15.6 million, reduced by $2.1
million in expenses and $0.6 million of unamortized debt costs related to these
notes.

Derivatives
We do not engage in hedging activity for
speculative or trading purposes. Under the terms of the CS credit agreement, we
were required to hedge floating interest rate exposure on 50% of our funded debt
balance through December 31, 2009. We entered into an interest rate collar
instrument with a financial institution that fixed the interest rate on $100.0
million of our variable rate term loan from December 31, 2008 through December
31, 2009. We incurred $1.5 million in interest expense in fiscal 2010 on this
collar.
Our interest rate collar did not meet all
of the criteria necessary for hedge accounting. We recorded the fair market
value in other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
change in fair market value in other income and expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations, recognizing a gain of $1.2 million in fiscal 2010. As
of December 31, 2009, the interest rate collar had expired.
NOTE 8: RESTRUCTURING
CHARGES
Our restructuring actions are steps
undertaken to reduce costs in an effort to return to consistent profitability.
In fiscal 2012 and 2011, restructuring actions to consolidate operations
supporting our business were the result of strategic management decisions. In
fiscal 2010, restructuring actions to consolidate operations supporting our
business were undertaken to improve operational efficiencies and to adapt our
operations in recognition of economic conditions. The following summarizes the
type of restructuring expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in
thousands):

Fiscal 2012 
Restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 were
primarily due to severance and benefits expenses of $1.6 million as a result of
strategic management decisions to consolidate operations supporting our
business. Most areas of the business, including international operations, were
impacted by these restructuring actions. The employees impacted were in our
research and development, sales and marketing and service teams. Facility
restructuring charges for fiscal 2012 were primarily due to negotiating a lease
settlement on a facility vacated in India. The other restructuring reversal for
fiscal 2012 was due to actual payments lower than estimated on a supplier
relationship exited in fiscal 2011. 
Fiscal 2011 
Restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 were
primarily due to severance and benefits expenses of $3.6 million as a result of
strategic management decisions to consolidate operations supporting our
business. Most areas of the business, including international operations, were
impacted by these restructuring actions. The employees impacted were in our
management, sales and marketing, research and development and service teams. The
facility reversals in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to negotiating settlements for lease
liabilities on two vacated facilities in the U.S. for amounts lower than the
outstanding lease contracts. The other restructuring charges were costs from
exiting a supplier relationship in fiscal 2011. 
64


Fiscal 2010 
For fiscal 2010, restructuring charges
were primarily due to $4.8 million in remaining contractual lease payments for
facilities vacated in the U.S. during fiscal 2010. We also vacated a facility in
India and negotiated a settlement for an amount lower than the outstanding lease
contract. Severance and benefits restructuring charges for fiscal 2010 were due
largely to eliminating additional positions in the U.S. and changes in our
estimates, primarily in Europe, as we completed settlement negotiations with
various local authorities. The other restructuring reversal in fiscal 2010 was
due to negotiating a settlement for contract termination fees related to a
program cancelled in a prior year.

The $1.8 million restructuring accrual as
of March 31, 2012 is primarily comprised of severance and benefits obligations,
the majority of which will be paid in fiscal 2013. The amounts accrued for
vacant facilities will be paid over their respective lease terms, which continue
through fiscal 2016.
Additional charges may be incurred in the
future related to these restructurings, particularly if the actual costs
associated with restructured activities are higher than estimated. Until we
achieve sustained profitability, we may incur additional charges in the future
related to additional cost reduction steps. Future charges that we may incur
associated with future cost reductions are not estimable at this
time.

NOTE 9: STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Description of Stock Incentive Plans 
Active Stock Incentive
Plans 
We have a Long-Term Incentive Plan that
provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchase rights and long-term performance awards to our employees, officers, and
consultants, as well as a Nonemployee Director Equity Incentive Plan that
provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchase rights and long-term performance awards to our nonemployee directors,
collectively the Active Plans. These plans have authorized 79.5 million shares
of stock of which 7.3 million shares of stock were available for grant as of
March 31, 2012. There are 26.5 million stock options and restricted shares
outstanding under the Active Plans as of March 31, 2012, which expire at various
times through June 2018.
With the exception of fiscal 2010, in
recent years we have primarily granted restricted stock units with a zero
purchase price. We continue to grant stock options to employees in certain
circumstances. In fiscal 2010, due to a combination of factors including our
share price at the beginning of the fiscal year, we primarily granted stock
options to our employees. Stock options granted in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010
generally vest over three to four years and have contractual terms of seven
years. Grants prior to fiscal 2005 had contractual terms of ten years. Stock
options under the Active Plans are granted at prices determined by the Board of
Directors, but at not less than the fair market value. The majority of
restricted stock units granted to employees in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 vest
over two to three years. Stock option and restricted stock grants to nonemployee
directors typically vest over one year. Both stock options and restricted stock
units granted under the Active Plans are subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates.
Other Stock Option
Plans 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2012,
we assumed outstanding unvested options and unvested restricted shares of
Pancetera which were exchanged into options and restricted shares of Quantum
common stock, respectively, in accordance with the merger agreement. As of June
13, 2011, Pancetera had approximately 0.8 million unvested stock options and 0.5
million unvested restricted shares outstanding. Based on the exchange ratio of
0.2403 calculated in accordance with the formula in the merger agreement, we
assumed the outstanding unvested options, which are exercisable for an aggregate
of 194,000 shares of Quantum common stock. Based on the relative cash and stock
consideration for Pancetera shares per the merger agreement, the unvested
restricted shares became 33,000 unvested restricted shares of Quantum common
stock and $200,000 in cash held in escrow. The estimated fair value of unvested
Pancetera options, unvested restricted shares and cash held in escrow related to
future service is being recognized over the remaining service
period. 
In addition to the Active Plans, we have
other stock option plans, including plans assumed in acquisitions, (Other
Plans) under which stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase
rights, restricted stock awards and long-term performance awards to employees,
consultants, officers and affiliates were authorized. Stock options granted and
assumed under the Other Plans generally vested over one to four years and
expired ten years after the grant date and restricted stock granted under the
Other Plans generally vested over one to three years. The Other Plans have been
terminated and outstanding stock options granted and assumed remain outstanding
and continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the respective other
stock option plan. Stock options and restricted stock granted under the Other
Plans are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates. Stock options under
the Other Plans were granted at prices determined by the Board of Directors, but
at not less than the fair market value and stock options assumed were governed
by the acquisition agreement. Stock options expire at various times through June
2021. 
Stock Purchase Plan 
We have an employee stock purchase plan
(the Purchase Plan) that allows for the purchase of stock at 85% of fair
market value at the date of grant or the exercise date, whichever value is less.
The Purchase Plan is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the Purchase Plan, rights to purchase shares are granted during the second
and fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Due to cancellation of rights from
August 2008 through January 2010 by the Board of Directors, there were no rights to
purchase shares granted during this period. Rights to purchase shares were
reinstated in February 2010 or the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The Purchase
Plan allows a maximum amount of two million shares to be purchased in any one
six month offering period. Employees purchased 3.0 million shares and 3.2
million shares of common stock under the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The weighted-average price of stock purchased under the Purchase
Plan was $1.66 and $1.22 in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. There were 2.9
million shares available for issuance as of March 31, 2012.
66


Determining Fair Value

We use the Black-Scholes stock option
valuation model for estimating fair value of stock options granted under our
plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our Purchase Plan. We amortize
the fair value of stock options on a ratable basis over the requisite service
periods, which are generally the vesting periods. The expected life of awards
granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding.
We determine the expected life based on historical experience with similar
awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, exercise patterns and
post-vesting forfeitures. We estimate volatility based on the historical
volatility of our common stock over the most recent period corresponding with
the estimated expected life of the award. We base the risk-free interest rate
used in the Black-Scholes stock option valuation model on the implied yield
currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent term
equal to the expected life of the award. We have not paid any cash dividends on
our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record
share-based compensation for those awards that are expected to vest. We adjust
share-based compensation for actual forfeitures. 
Stock Options 
The weighted-average estimated fair values
and the assumptions used in calculating fair values for stock options granted
under the Active Plans during each fiscal period are as follows:

The total share-based compensation cost

During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, no tax benefit was realized for the tax
deduction from stock option exercises and other awards due to tax benefit
carryforwards and tax ordering requirements. 
As of March
31, 2012, there was $3.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to stock options granted under our plans. This unrecognized compensation cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. Total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended March 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010 was $3.7 million, $8.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively. We
settle stock option exercises by issuing additional common shares. 
As of March 31, 2012, there was $20.8
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted
stock. The unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. Total fair value of
awards released during the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $9.4
million, $7.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, based on the fair value of
our common stock on the date of award release. We issue additional common shares
upon vesting of restricted stock units.

During fiscal 2012, we recorded a net
decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits. Including interest and penalties, the
total unrecognized tax benefit at March 31, 2012 was $33.6 million, all of
which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate. At March
31, 2012 accrued interest and penalties totaled $0.9 million. 
We file our tax returns as prescribed by
the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our U.S. tax returns have
been audited for years through 2002 by the Internal Revenue Service. In other
major jurisdictions, we are generally open to examination for the most recent
three to five fiscal years. Although timing of the resolution and closure on
audits is highly uncertain, we do not believe it is likely that the unrecognized
tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months. 
As of March 31, 2012, we had federal net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $202.7 million and
$156.9 million, respectively. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards
include $33.6 million attributable to excess tax deductions from stock option
exercises, and are not included in the deferred tax assets shown above. The
benefit of these loss carryforwards will be credited to equity when realized.
The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts
beginning in fiscal 2013 if not previously utilized, the utilization of which is
limited under the tax law ownership change provision. These carryforwards
include $10.8 million of acquired net operating losses and $15.6 million of
credits. 
Certain changes in stock ownership could
result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
carryovers that can be utilized each year. Should the company undergo such a
change in stock ownership, it could severely limit the usage of these carryover
tax attributes against future income, resulting in additional tax charges.

Due to our history of net losses and the
difficulty in predicting future results, we believe that we cannot rely on
projections of future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net
deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining
our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances for purposes of
assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax
assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive
evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance. Our income
tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent that sufficient
positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of, or decrease in, our
valuation allowance.
NOTE 12: NET INCOME (LOSS) PER
SHARE
Equity Instruments Outstanding

We have granted stock options and
restricted stock units under our Plans that, upon exercise and vesting,
respectively, would increase shares outstanding. On November 15, 2010, we issued
3.50% convertible subordinated notes which are convertible at the option of the
holders at any time prior to maturity into shares of Quantum common stock at a
conversion price of $4.33 per share. These notes, if converted, would increase
shares outstanding.
On June 3, 2009 we entered into an
agreement with EMC Corporation (EMC) which provides for the issuance of
certain warrants. On June 23, 2009, we issued a warrant to EMC to purchase 10
million shares of our common stock at a $0.38 per share exercise price. Only in
the event of a change of control of Quantum will this warrant vest and be
exercisable. It expires seven years from the date of issuance or three years
after change of control, whichever occurs first. Due to these terms, no
share-based compensation expense related to this warrant has been recorded to
date. 
At March 31, 2010, we had outstanding
4.375% convertible subordinated notes which were convertible at the option of
the holders at any time prior to maturity into shares of Quantum common stock at
a conversion price of $4.35 per share.

  excluded. 
Stock options to purchase 11.5 million, 10.4
  million and 18.8 million weighted average shares in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively, were excluded. 
Unvested restricted stock units of 5.1 million,
  49,000 and 0.2 million weighted average shares for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2012, respectively, were excluded. 
NOTE 13: COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES
Lease Commitments 
We lease certain facilities under
non-cancelable lease agreements and also have equipment leases for various
office equipment. Some of the leases have renewal options ranging from one to
ten years and others contain escalation clauses. These leases are operating
leases. 
In February
2006, we leased a campus facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, comprised of
three buildings in three separate operating leases with initial terms of five,
seven and 15 years. In August 2010, we negotiated lower lease rates and a five
year extension on one of the buildings. The future minimum lease payment
schedule below includes $29.9 million for this Colorado Springs campus.

Rent expense was $12.7 million in both
fiscal 2012 and 2011 and $13.8 million for fiscal 2010. Sublease income was
immaterial in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and was $0.7 million for fiscal 2010.

Future minimum lease payments are as

Commitments to Purchase Inventory

We use contract manufacturers for certain
manufacturing functions. Under these arrangements, the contract manufacturer
procures inventory to manufacture products based upon our forecast of customer
demand. We are responsible for the financial impact on the contract manufacturer
of any reduction or product mix shift in the forecast relative to materials that
the contract manufacturer had already purchased under a prior forecast. Such a
variance in forecasted demand could require a cash payment for finished goods in
excess of current customer demand or for costs of excess or obsolete inventory.
As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we had issued non-cancelable purchase commitments
for $34.3 million and $33.8 million, respectively, to purchase finished goods
from our contract manufacturers.
Legal Proceedings 
On September 12, 2011, Compression
Technology Solutions LLC (CTS) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against a
group of companies, consisting of Quantum, CA., Inc., EMC Corporation,
Hewlett-Packard Company, International Business Machines Corp., NetApp, Inc. and
Quest Software, Inc., in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of
Missouri, alleging that certain unspecified products of the defendants,
characterized as deduplication software systems, and, in the case of Quantum,
including Quantums DXi Series Deduplication software, fall within the scope
of patent 5,414,650. CTS is seeking injunctive relief, as well as the recovery
of monetary damages, including treble damages for willful infringement. We do
not believe we infringe the CTS patent; we believe that the CTS patent is
invalid, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. In April 2012, our motion
to transfer venue was granted and the lawsuit was transferred to the U.S.
District Court in the Northern District of California. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, we cannot identify probable or estimable damages
related to the lawsuit. 
Indemnifications 
We have certain financial guarantees, both
express and implied, related to product liability and potential infringement of
intellectual property. Other than certain product liabilities recorded as of
March 31, 2012 and 2011, we did not record a liability associated with these
guarantees, as we have little or no history of costs associated with such
indemnification requirements. Contingent liabilities associated with product
liability may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain. 
In the normal course of business to
facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain
parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants,
or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against
certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an
indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we
have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors,
and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It is not possible to determine the
maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the
limited history of our indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made
by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating
results, financial position or cash flows.

ITEM 9.  

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
      ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report
on Form 10-K are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), which are required pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Controls
and Procedures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information
concerning the controls and controls evaluation referenced in the
certifications. This section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in
conjunction with the certifications and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
as described below, for a more complete understanding of the matters presented.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 
We evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This control evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our CEO and CFO. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. Disclosure
controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Based on the controls evaluation, our CEO
and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls were effective. 
Management Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and
CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012 based on the guidelines
established in Internal Control  Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results
of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2012 to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. 
76


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
regarding its assessment of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012, as set forth at the beginning of Part II, Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Limitations on Effectiveness of
Controls 
Our management, including our CEO and CFO,
does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,
by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting 
There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal controls over financial reporting.
