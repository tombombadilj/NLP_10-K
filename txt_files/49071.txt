Forward-Looking Statements 
Some of the statements under Business, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, and elsewhere in this report may contain forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and
projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the information discussed under the section
entitled Risk Factors in this report. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and
competitive with many different factors affecting results.  PART I 
 


ITEM 1.
BUSINESS General 
Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries, referred to throughout this document as we,
us, our, the Company or Humana, is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong
well-being. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 11.2 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 7.3 million members in our specialty products. During 2011, 76% of our premiums and services revenue
were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 16% related to our Medicare Advantage contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and 10% related to our military services contracts. Under our
Medicare Advantage CMS contracts in Florida, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 381,300 members as of December 31, 2011.  Humana Inc. was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is
(502) 580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We have made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our web site our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form
8-K, proxy statements, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  This Annual Report on Form 10-K, or 2011 Form 10-K, contains both historical and
forward-looking information. See Item 1A.  Risk Factors in this 2011 Form 10-K for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business.  Health Insurance Reform  In March 2010, the President signed into law
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S.
health insurance industry. There are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on
our overall business, which we expect to occur over the next several years.  Certain significant provisions of the Health
Insurance Reform Legislation include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare 
  3 


Table of Contents

Advantage premiums, the establishment of state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, an annual insurance industry premium-based assessment, and a
three-year commercial reinsurance fee. Implementation dates of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation vary from September 30, 2010 to as late as 2018. The Health Insurance Reform Legislation is discussed more fully in Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled Health Insurance Reform.  2011 Business Segment Realignment  During the first quarter of 2011, we
realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. As a result, we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect managements view of the business and to align our
external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial reporting model. Historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of this change. Our new reportable segments and the basis for
determining those segments are discussed below.  Business Segments 
We currently manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Employer Group, and Health and Well-Being Services. In addition,
we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles in an Other Businesses category. These segments are based on a combination of the
type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess
performance and allocate resources.  The Retail segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical and
specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, marketed directly to individuals. The Employer Group segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical
and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups. The Health and Well-Being Services
segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including primary care, pharmacy, integrated wellness, and home care services. The Other Businesses category consists of our
Military services, primarily our TRICARE South Region contract, Medicaid, and closed-block long-term care businesses as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition program, or the LI-NET program.
 The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. Transactions between reportable segments consist of
sales of services rendered by our Health and Well-Being Services segment, primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services, to our Retail and Employer Group customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in
consolidation. Members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the
profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting
segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at the corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment
eliminations.

Table of Contents
Our Products  Our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. These products may vary in
the degree to which members have coverage. Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, generally require a referral from the members primary care physician before seeing certain specialty physicians. Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs,
provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral. However PPOs generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the providers fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider
participating in the PPOs network. Point of Service, or POS, plans combine the advantages of HMO plans with the flexibility of PPO plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose, at the time medical services are needed, to seek care from
a provider within the plans network or outside the network. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including pharmacy, primary care, integrated wellness, and home
care services. The discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments.  Our Retail Segment Products
 This segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit
plans described in the discussion that follows. The following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the Retail segment by product for the year ended December 31, 2011:

 Individual Medicare 
We have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 25 years and have established a national presence, offering
at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. We have a geographically diverse membership base that provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and
clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care. We believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from
making positive behavior changes.  Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled
persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without
the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care
and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and 
  5 


Table of Contents

Part B coverage under original Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as original Medicare. As an
alternative to original Medicare, in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization
under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original Medicare. Our Medicare Advantage plans
are discussed more fully below. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D.  Individual Medicare Advantage
Products  We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance
benefits, including wellness programs, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With each of these
products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original Medicare, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs, complex case
management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, disease management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug
benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following
section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Generally, Medicare-eligible
individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on January 1.  Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while
seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations, HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing.
In most cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program. 
Our Medicare PFFS plans generally have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical
Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original Medicare payment rates. On January 1, 2011, most of our members enrolled in PFFS plans transitioned
to networked-based PPO type products due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans.
 CMS uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit
plans. These rates are adjusted under CMSs risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the accuracy of payment. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of
1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings
(hospital outpatient department and physician visits) to establish the risk-adjustment payments. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information
to CMS within prescribed deadlines.  At December 31, 2011, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to
approximately 1,640,300 individual Medicare Advantage members. Under our individual Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS in Florida, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 362,100 members. These Florida

  6 


Table of Contents

contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $5.6 billion, which represented approximately 31% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 15% of our consolidated
premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Our HMO, PPO, and PFFS products covered under
Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to
renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage products have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with
CMS for 2012 have been approved.  Individual Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products 
We offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of
our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on January 1. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced
coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. In October 2010, we announced the lowest premium national stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan co-branded with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the
Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan. This plan was first offered for the 2011 plan year. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary
and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled Medicare Part D Provisions. Our stand-alone PDP
contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first
Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP products have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2012
have been approved.  Medicare and Medicaid Dual Eligible 
Medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for Medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries, or dual
eligibles. There were approximately 9 million dual eligible enrollees in 2011. These dual eligibles may enroll in a privately-offered Medicare Advantage product, but may also receive assistance from Medicaid for Medicaid benefits, such as
nursing home care and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. As of December 31, 2011, we served approximately 242,000 dual eligible members in our Medicare Advantage plans and approximately 482,000 dual eligible members in our
stand-alone prescription drug plans.  Individual Commercial Coverage 
Our individual health plans, marketed under the HumanaOne® brand include offerings designed to promote wellness and engage consumers. HumanaOne plans are designed specifically for self-employed entrepreneurs, small-business
employees, part-time workers, students, and early retirees and include a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance levels and annual deductible choices, as well as HumanaVitality®, our wellness and loyalty rewards program.  Our HumanaOne plans primarily are offered as PPO plans in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. This individual product
includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses.  The HumanaOne
plans can be further customized with optional benefits such as dental, vision, life, and a broad portfolio of financial protection products.

 Employer Group Commercial Coverage 
Our commercial products sold to employer groups include a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance
levels and annual deductible choices that employers of all sizes can offer to their employees on either a fully-insured, through HMO, PPO, or POS plans, or self-funded basis. Our plans integrate clinical programs, plan designs, communication tools,
and spending accounts. We participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, primarily with our HMO offering in certain markets. FEHBP is the governments health insurance program for Federal employees, retirees, former
employees, family members, and spouses. As with our individual commercial products, the employer group offerings include HumanaVitalitys wellness offerings.  Our administrative services only, or ASO, products are offered to employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the
processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design
characteristics of our fully-insured HMO, PPO, or POS products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, more than half of our ASO
customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs.  As
with individual commercial policies, employers can customize their offerings with optional benefits such as dental, vision, life, and a broad portfolio of financial protection products. 
Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone PDP 
We offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement
products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an
employers post-retirement benefit structure.

 Military Services  Under our TRICARE South Region contract with the United States Department of Defense, or DoD, we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired
military personnel and their dependents. Currently, three health benefit options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in a HMO-like plan with a point-of-service option or take
advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers, similar to a PPO.  We have participated in the
TRICARE program since 1996 under contracts with the Department of Defense. Our current TRICARE South Region contract, which we were awarded in 2003, covers approximately 3.0 million eligible beneficiaries as of December 31, 2011 in
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. The South Region is one of the three regions in the United States as defined by the Department of Defense. Of these eligible beneficiaries,
1.3 million were TRICARE ASO members representing active duty beneficiaries and seniors over the age of 65 for which the Department of Defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit. We have subcontracted with
third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract. The original 5-year South Region contract expired on March 31, 2009 and was extended through March 31, 2012. On February 25, 2011, the
Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the new TRICARE South Region contract to us, which we expect to take effect on April 1, 2012. The new 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2017, is subject
to annual renewals on April 1 of each year during its term at the governments option.

Table of Contents
Under the current TRICARE South Region contract, any variance from the negotiated target
health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or
reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments.  The TRICARE South Region contract represents approximately 97% of total military services premiums and services revenue.  Medicaid  Medicaid is a federal program that is state-operated to
facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to low-income residents. Each electing state develops, through a state-specific regulatory agency, a Medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by CMS. CMS requires that Medicaid
managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee-for-service basis. States currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one
or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program. In either case, the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a one-year period. Under these contracts, we receive a fixed monthly payment from a
government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product in their
Medicaid programs.  Our Medicaid business consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto
Rico.  LI-NET  In 2010, we began to administer CMSs LI-NET program. This program allows individuals who receive Medicares low-income subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point
of sale if they are not already enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. CMS temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both Medicare and Medicaid into the LI-NET program, and subsequently transitions each member into a Medicare Part D plan
that may or may not be a Humana Medicare plan.  Closed Block of Long-Term Care Insurance 
We acquired a closed block of approximately 35,000 long-term care policies in connection with our acquisition of KMG America Corporation
in 2007. Long-term care policies are intended to protect the insured from the cost of long-term care services including those provided by nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and adult day care as well as home health care services. No new
policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block.

Includes 27,600 Medicare Advantage ASO members. 
Provider Arrangements 
We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted,
including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers, primary care physicians, specialist physicians, dentists, and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. These ancillary services and
facilities include ambulance services, medical equipment services, home health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our
members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers.  We use a variety of techniques to
provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into
various disease management programs. The focal point for health care services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care physician who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate
services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have 
  12 


Table of Contents

arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. Our hospitalist programs use specially-trained physicians to
effectively manage the entire range of an HMO members medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the members discharge and post-discharge care. We have available a variety of disease management programs
related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain other conditions. 
We typically contract with hospitals on either (1) a per diem rate, which is an all-inclusive rate per day, (2) a case rate or
diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3) a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service, ambulatory
payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often multi-year agreements, with rates that are
adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are
reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule.  Our contracts with
physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and
some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule. 
The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a twelve-member joint committee of Congress known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit
Reduction to propose legislation to reduce the United States federal deficit by $1.5 trillion for fiscal years 2012-2021. The failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to achieve a targeted deficit reduction by December 23,
2011 triggered an automatic reduction, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year. At this time it is unclear how this automatic reduction may be applied to various Medicare healthcare
programs or the timing when such reductions may begin. We expect that if such reductions were to occur, there would be a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers. Due to the uncertainty around the timing or application of
any such reductions, there can be no assurances that we could completely offset any reductions to the Medicare healthcare programs applied by the Budget Control Act of 2011.  Capitation  For approximately 1.0% of our medical membership, including
3.3% of our total Medicare Advantage membership, at December 31, 2011, we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of HMO membership. In transferring this risk, we prepay these providers a monthly
fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated HMO membership, including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing. For these
capitated HMO arrangements, we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio. The benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums revenue. Providers
participating in hospital-based capitated HMO arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their HMO membership. Providers participating in physician-based capitated HMO arrangements generally have
subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians, and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and specialist physicians for services rendered to their HMO membership. 
For approximately 8.6% of our medical membership, including 19.0% of our total Medicare Advantage membership, at December 31, 2011,
we contract with physicians under risk-sharing arrangements whereby 
  13 


Table of Contents

physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their HMO membership. Although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services
rendered, we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements. 
Physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physicians financial risk for any single
member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers. However, we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers
fail to provide such services.  Medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at December 31, 2011
and 2010:

 Accreditation Assessment  Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies, as well
as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Sets, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National
Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to evaluate health plans based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction.  Physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also
meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. 
Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years, depending on applicable state laws. Recredentialing of
participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses; review of their malpractice liability claims histories; review of their board certifications, if applicable; and review of applicable quality information. A committee,
composed of a peer group of physicians, reviews the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing.  We request accreditation for certain of our health plans and/or departments from NCQA, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, or
URAC. Accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida and Kansas for licensure as an HMO. Certain commercial businesses, like those impacted by a third-party labor agreement or those where a request
is made by the employer, may require or prefer accredited health plans.

NCQA performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement,
credentialing, utilization management, member connections, and member rights and responsibilities. We have achieved and maintained NCQA accreditation in all of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid HMO/POS markets with enough history and membership,
except Puerto Rico, and for many of our PPO markets.  Sales and Marketing 
We use various methods to market our products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, and direct mailings. 
At December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 2,000 sales representatives, as well as approximately 900
telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare products in our Retail segment by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We also market our Medicare products via a strategic alliance with
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or Wal-Mart. This alliance includes stationing Humana representatives in certain Wal-Mart stores, SAMS CLUB locations, and Neighborhood Markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll Medicare eligible
individuals in person. In addition, we market our Medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with State Farm® and United Services Automobile Association, or USAA. Commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit
commission structure approved by CMS. For our Retail segment, we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals.  In our Employer Group segment, individuals may become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or other groups, which typically offer employees or members a selection of health
insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employers or groups exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a
variety of HMO, PPO, and specialty products that provide cost-effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members. We also sell group Medicare Advantage products through large employers.
 For both our Retail and Employer Group segments, at December 31, 2011, we used licensed independent brokers and agents
and approximately 1,100 licensed employees to sell our commercial insurance products. Many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care
products. We generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay
brokers and agents based on other metrics. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple
customers.  Underwriting  Through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria, we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products. In most instances, employer
and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage. Small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and
prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions. Beginning in 2014, the Health Insurance Reform Legislation requires all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and
renew coverage without pre-existing condition exclusions or health-status rating adjustments.  Underwriting techniques are not
employed in connection with our Medicare, military services, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history.

Competition  The health benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and
PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of our competitors have larger memberships and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be
influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled Risk Factors in this 2011 Form 10-K.  Government
Regulation  Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects
of the nations health care system.  Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and
regulations affecting our business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of
the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  For a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see the section entitled Risk Factors in this 2011 Form 10-K. 
Other  Captive
Insurance Company  We bear general business risks associated with operating our Company such as professional and
general liability, employee workers compensation, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit
coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance
companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses. 
Centralized Management Services  We provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems,
product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, and customer service. 
Employees  As of
December 31, 2011, we had approximately 40,000 employees, including approximately 2,050 medical professionals working under management agreements between Concentra and affiliated physician-owned associations. We believe we have good relations
with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS  If we
do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, our profitability
may be materially adversely affected. We estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns,
medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to
changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends.  We use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of
health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments to providers (predetermined amounts paid to cover services), and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our
members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of
our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns,
medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record benefits payable for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to
benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment
patterns and medical cost trends. Many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. These factors may include: 
 


 

 
 increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; 
 


 

 
 increased cost of such services;   


 

 
 our membership mix;   


 

 
 variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level
changes;   


 

 
 changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market; 
 


 

 
 changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician
referrals;   


 

 
 changes in our pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers; 
 


 

 
 catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health epidemics, or severe weather (e.g. hurricanes and earthquakes); 
 


 

 
 the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; 
 


 

 
 medical cost inflation; and   


 

 
 government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including any that result from CMS Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D risk adjustment
regulatory changes or Health Insurance Reform Legislation.  In addition, we also estimate costs associated
with long-duration insurance policies including life insurance, annuities, health, and long-term care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in
future years. These future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, as modified based upon
actual experience. The assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time 
  17 


Table of Contents

each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability, together with the present value of future gross
premiums, are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits. Future policy benefits payable include $938 million at December 31, 2011 associated with a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the
November 30, 2007 KMG America Corporation acquisition. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a
deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care policies. We monitor the loss experience of these long-term care policies, and, when
necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. However, to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date
assumptions, additional future adjustments to reserves could be required. During the fourth quarter of 2010, certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our long-term care block that were significantly below our acquisition
date assumptions. Based on these actions by the states, combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions, we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable, together with the
present value of future gross premiums, associated with our long-term care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies; therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations.
Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded $139 million of additional benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of $170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of $31
million included in other long-term assets.  Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable
or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  We are in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some
markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare program. We believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur
relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors,
including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to
contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform, and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. 
Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationships with our providers in various markets, among other issues,
could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into Medicare or commercial markets, or the termination of a large contract. 
If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase
our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.  If we fail to
effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in Medicare products.
 Our future performance depends in large part upon our management teams ability to execute our strategy to
position us for the future. This strategy includes opportunities created by the expansion of our Medicare 
  18 


Table of Contents

programs, including our HMO and PPO products, as well as our stand-alone PDP products. We have made substantial investments in the Medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these
programs. Over the last few years we have increased the size of our Medicare geographic reach through expanded Medicare product offerings. We are offering both the stand-alone Medicare prescription drug coverage and Medicare Advantage health plan
with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings. We offer the Medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 
The growth of our Medicare products is an important part of our business strategy. Any failure to achieve this growth may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the expansion of our Medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in Medicare products. There is significant
concentration of our revenues in Medicare products, with approximately 65% of our total premiums and services revenue in 2011 generated from our Medicare products. These expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and
increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, as discussed further below.  Recently enacted Health
Insurance Reform Legislation created a federal Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office to serve dual eligibles. This Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of
care between Medicare and Medicaid. Depending upon the results of those demonstration projects, CMS may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced. If we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles
opportunity, or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members, our business may be materially adversely affected.  Additionally, our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products, such as ASO and individual products, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including HumanaVitality and other
wellness products, expansion of our specialty products such as dental, vision and other supplemental products, the adoption of new technologies, development of adjacent businesses, and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts, including
the 2010 acquisition of Concentra Inc.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our
operational and strategic initiatives, including outsourcing certain business functions, that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed. Failure to implement
this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect our
proprietary rights to our systems, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business may be materially adversely affected.  Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers
with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial
results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. We took steps to reduce the number of systems we
operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and
enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our
businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing
appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer
other adverse consequences.

We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related
support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to
perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating
results.  We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and
copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software
industry, including litigation involving end users of software products. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows. 
Our business plans also include becoming a quality e-business organization by enhancing interactions with customers, brokers, agents,
providers and other stakeholders through web-enabled technology. Our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the Internet, and implementation of advanced self-service capabilities, for internal and external
stakeholders.  A cybersecurity attack that bypasses our information technology, or IT, security systems causing a security
breach may lead to a material disruption of our information technology business systems and/or the loss of business information. If a cybersecurity attack were to be successful, we could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss,
misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our IT systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, brokers,
agents, providers, and other stakeholders.  There can be no assurance that our IT process will successfully improve existing
systems, develop new systems to support our expanding operations, integrate new systems, protect our proprietary information, defend against cybersecurity attacks, or improve service levels. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional
systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Our business may be materially adversely impacted by CMSs
adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses.  CMS has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses, commonly known as
ICD-10, which significantly expands the number of codes utilized. We may be required to incur significant expenses in implementing the new coding set. If we do not adequately implement the new coding set, our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.  We are involved in various legal actions and governmental
and internal investigations, including, without limitation, an ongoing internal investigation and litigation and government requests for information related to certain aspects of our Florida subsidiary operations, any of which, if resolved
unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.  We are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions,
securities laws claims, and tort claims. 
  20 


Table of Contents
In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety
of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management, and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: 
 


 

 
 claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums; 
 


 

 
 claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments; 
 


 

 
 claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage; 
 


 

 
 challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; 
 


 

 
 claims relating to our administration of our Medicare Part D offerings; 
 


 

 
 medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for providers alleged
malpractice;   


 

 
 claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers proposed medical
treatment plans for patients;   


 

 
 allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; 
 


 

 
 provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; 
 


 

 
 disputes related to ASO business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; 
 


 

 
 qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that we, as a government contractor, submitted false
claims to the government;   


 

 
 claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; 
 


 

 
 claims relating to customer audits and contract performance; 
 


 

 
 claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house mail-order pharmacy; and 
 


 

 
 professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public, including urgent care.
 In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal
False Claims Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other statutes may be sought.  While we currently
have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition,
some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. In some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive
in the future.  The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public
perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely
affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate, and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these
factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  See Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We cannot
predict the outcome of these suits with certainty.

Table of Contents
As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely
affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.  A significant
portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, Military, and Medicaid programs. These programs accounted for approximately 78% of our total premiums and services revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2011. These programs involve various risks, as described further below.   


 

 
 At December 31, 2011, under our contracts with CMS we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 381,300 Medicare Advantage members in
Florida. These contracts accounted for approximately 16% of our total premiums and services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. The loss of these and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the Medicare program as a result of
legislative or regulatory action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.   


 

 
 At December 31, 2011, our military services business primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract which covers approximately
3.0 million beneficiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2011, premiums and services revenue associated with the TRICARE South Region contract accounted for approximately 9.8% of our total premiums and services revenue. The original
5-year South Region contract expired on March 31, 2009 and was extended through March 31, 2012. On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the new TRICARE South Region contract to us,
which we expect to take effect on April 1, 2012. The new 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2017, is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year during its term at the governments option. We expect to
account for revenues under the new TRICARE South contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement. As such, we expect a decline in TRICARE revenues for 2012 and an increase in our operating
cost ratio as compared to 2011. Under the current TRICARE South Region contract, any variance from the negotiated target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated
target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to increase or decrease
U.S. military deployments. The loss of the TRICARE South Region contract or, in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs, may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.   


 

 
 At December 31, 2011, under our contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, or PRHIA, we provided health insurance coverage to
approximately 529,300 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico. These contracts accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
Effective October 1, 2010, the PRHIA awarded us three contracts for the East, Southeast, and Southwest regions for a one year term
with two options to extend the contracts for an additional term of up to one year, exercisable at the sole discretion of the PRHIA. The loss of these contracts or significant changes in the Puerto Rico Medicaid program as a result of legislative
action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
  


 

 
 There is a possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if
we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act. As a government contractor, we may be subject to qui tam litigation
brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that the government 
  22 


Table of Contents


 
 
contractor submitted false claims to the government. Litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene
and assume control of the litigation. If the government does not intervene, the lawsuit is unsealed, and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own.

 CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model
pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a comparison of our
beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the governments original Medicare program. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary
diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to Medicare
Advantage plans. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to
appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims.  CMS is
continuing to perform audits of various companies selected Medicare Advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data. These audits are referred to herein as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits
review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans. To date, six Humana contracts
have been selected by CMS for RADV audits for the 2007 contract year, consisting of one pilot audit and five targeted audits for Humana plans.  On December 21, 2010, CMS posted a description of the agencys proposed RADV sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website, and invited public comment, noting that CMS
may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received. We believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by CMS is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound. In essence, in making the
comparison referred to above, CMS relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans: (1) fee for service (FFS) data from the governments original Medicare program; and (2) MA data. The
proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data (MA data), while not performing the same exercise on the other set (FFS data). However, because these two sets of data are inextricably linked, we believe CMS must audit and
validate both of them before extrapolating any potential RADV audit results, in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate. We believe that the Social Security Act, under which the payment model was established, requires the
consistent use of these data sets in determining risk-adjusted payments to MA plans. Furthermore, our payment received from CMS, as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members, is based on bids that did not, by CMS design, include any
assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. We believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after CMS acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums. 
CMS has received public comments, including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the American Academy of
Actuaries, which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data. On February 3, 2011, CMS issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making
changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received, although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make.  We believe that the proposed methodology is actuarially unsound and in violation of the Social Security Act. We intend to defend that position vigorously. However, if CMS moves forward with implementation
of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data 
  23 


Table of Contents

inconsistency issues described above, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the Medicare Advantage program and, therefore, our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

 Our CMS contracts which cover members prescription drugs under Medicare Part D contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for
prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk. These provisions, certain of which are described below, affect our ultimate payments from CMS.  The premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under
the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received (known as a risk corridor). We
estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider
factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility differences with CMS. Our estimate of the settlement associated with the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions was a net payable of $329 million at December 31, 2011. 
Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent payments from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume
no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent payments for CMSs portion of claims costs which exceed the members out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent payments from CMS for all or a
portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted
with our annual bid. A reconciliation and settlement of CMSs prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year.  Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. This
reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Our claims data may not pass CMSs claims edit processes due to various reasons, including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of
low-income members. To the extent our data does not pass CMSs claim edit processes, we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have
otherwise received as a low-income or reinsurance claim. In addition, in the event the settlement represents an amount CMS owes us, there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing CMSs share of the
risk. The opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe CMS.

 The Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011, increased the United States debt ceiling conditioned on deficit reductions to be
achieved over the next ten years. The Budget Control Act of 2011 also established a twelve-member joint committee of Congress known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose legislation to reduce the United States federal deficit
by $1.5 trillion for fiscal years 2012-2021. The failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to achieve a targeted deficit reduction by December 23, 2011 triggered an automatic reduction, including aggregate reductions to
Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year. At this time it is unclear how this automatic reduction may be applied to various Medicare healthcare programs or the timing when such reductions may begin. We expect that if such
reductions were to occur, there would be a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers. Due to the uncertainty around the timing or application of any such reductions, there can be no assurances that we could completely
offset any reductions to the Medicare healthcare programs applied by the Budget Control Act of 2011.

 With the assistance of outside counsel, we are conducting an ongoing internal investigation related to certain aspects of our Florida subsidiary
operations, and have voluntarily self-reported the existence of 
  24

this investigation to CMS, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Matters under review include, without limitation, the relationships between
certain of our Florida-based employees and providers in our Medicaid and/or Medicare networks, practices related to the financial support of non-profit or provider access centers for Medicaid enrollment and related enrollment processes, and loans to
or other financial support of physician practices. We have reported to the regulatory authorities noted above on the progress of our investigation to date, and intend to continue to discuss with these authorities our factual findings as well as any
remedial actions we may take. We may also face litigation or further government inquiry regarding certain aspects of the Medicare and Medicaid operations of certain of our Florida subsidiaries.

 We are also subject to various other governmental audits and investigations. Under state laws, our HMOs and health insurance companies are audited by
state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance. Our HMOs are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health. Audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general, CMS, the
Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency. All of these activities could result in the loss of
licensure or the right to participate in various programs, including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products, the imposition of fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions, or changes in our business practices. The outcome
of any current or future governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of
federal or state regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Certain of these matters could
also affect our reputation. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and
services.  Recently enacted health insurance reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments,
restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products (and particularly how the ratio may apply to Medicare plans), lowering our
Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments; financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill; and cash flows. In addition, if the new
non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments, including a three-year commercial reinsurance fee, were imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments, such as through the
reduction of our operating costs, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
 In March 2010, the President signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. While regulations and interpretive
guidance on some provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation have been issued to date by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department, and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall
business, which we expect to occur over the next several years.  The provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation
include, among others, imposing significant new non-deductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers, limiting Medicare Advantage 
  25 


Table of Contents

payment rates, stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products (and particularly how the ratio may apply to Medicare
Advantage and possibly prescription drug plans), additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of
underlying risk, and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices, including our Medicare bid and pricing practices. The Health Insurance Reform Legislation also specifies required benefit designs, limits rating and
pricing practices, encourages additional competition (including potential incentives for new market entrants), establishes state-based exchanges for individuals and small employers (with up to 100 employees) coupled with programs designed to spread
risk among insurers, and expands eligibility for Medicaid programs. In addition, the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan
premiums on a timely basis. Financing for these reforms will come, in part, from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and individuals beginning in 2014, as well as reductions in certain levels of
payments to us and other health plans under Medicare. Implementation dates of the provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation generally vary from September 23, 2010 to as late as 2018. 
Implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the Health
Insurance Reform Legislation. The implementation of the individual mandate as well as Medicaid expansion in the Health Insurance Reform Legislation are also being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to have all or portions of the Health
Insurance Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. We cannot predict the results of these proceedings. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Insurance Reform Legislation, or may attempt to replace the
legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether. Given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation, implementation, and timing of these changes, which we expect to occur over the next several years, the Health
Insurance Reform Legislation could change the way we do business, potentially impacting our pricing, benefit design, product mix, geographic mix, and distribution channels. In particular, implementing regulations and related guidance are forthcoming
on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirements applicability to Medicare, including aggregation, credibility thresholds, and its possible application to prescription drug plans. The response of other companies to Health Insurance
Reform Legislation and adjustments to their offerings, if any, could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. It is reasonably possible
that the Health Insurance Reform Legislation and related regulations, as well as future legislative changes, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium
growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible
federal premium tax and other assessments; our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill; and our cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the
implementation of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation, our business may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments, including a three-year commercial reinsurance fee, were
imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments, such as through the reduction of our operating costs, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax and other
assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
Our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or
regulations or their manner of application, could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business, profitability, financial condition, and cash flows. 
The health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation:

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act)  The use of individually identifiable health data by our
business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are
derived from the privacy provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through
standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers, and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. The rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws,
but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent.  These regulations set standards for
the security of electronic health information. Violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems
enhancements, training and administrative effort. HIPAA can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates (e.g., entities that provide services to health plans). 
The HITECH Act, one part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and
security regulations of HIPAA. Among other requirements, the HITECH Act mandates individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information, provides enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and
grants enforcement authority to states Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office of Civil Rights. On October 30, 2009, HHS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing amendments to the enforcement regulations under HIPAA. On
July 14, 2010, HHS issued a Proposed Rule containing modifications to privacy standards, security standards, and enforcement actions. In addition, HHS is currently in the process of finalizing regulations addressing security breach notification
requirements. HHS initially released an Interim Final Rule for breach notification requirements on August 24, 2009. HHS then drafted a Final Rule which was submitted to Office of Management and Budget but subsequently withdrawn by HHS on
July 29, 2010. Currently, the Interim Final Rule remains in effect but the withdrawal suggests that when HHS issues the Final Rule, the requirements for how covered entities should respond in the event of a potential security breach involving
protected health information are likely to be more onerous than those contained in the Interim Final Rule.  In addition, there
are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional
penalties. Violations of HIPAA or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations requires
significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. An investigation or initiation of civil or criminal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation. 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)  On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, was enacted into law. In addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued
pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, ARRA also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, or
PHI. Among other things, ARRA requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI to any impacted individuals and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in those instances where the
unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individuals, and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. ARRA also
requires business associates to 
  27 


Table of Contents

comply with certain HIPAA provisions. ARRA also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with HIPAAs provisions
and requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements. Workers Compensation Laws and Regulations  In performing services for
the workers compensation industry through our subsidiary Concentra Inc., we must comply with applicable state workers compensation laws. Workers compensation laws generally require employers to assume financial responsibility for
medical costs, lost wages, and related legal costs of work-related illnesses and injuries. These laws generally establish the rights of workers to receive benefits and to appeal benefit denials, prohibit charging medical co-payments or deductibles
to employees, may restrict employers rights to select healthcare providers or direct an injured employee to a specific provider to receive non-emergency workers compensation medical care, and may include special requirements for
physicians providing non-emergency care for workers compensation patients, including requiring registration with the state agency governing workers compensation, as well as special continuing education and training, licensing and other
regulatory requirements. To the extent that we are governed by these regulations, we may be subject to additional licensing requirements, financial oversight, and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers. 
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Other Laws  As a corporate entity, Humana Inc. is not licensed to practice medicine. Many states in which we operate through our subsidiary Concentra Inc. limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or
professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals, and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians. Statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between
physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary widely from state to state. Under management agreements between Concentra and its affiliated physician-owned professional groups, these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical
decisions, as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers, developing operating policies and procedures, implementing professional standards and controls, and maintaining malpractice insurance. We believe that
our health services operations, including arrangements with Concentras affiliated professional groups, comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, and similar issues. However, any enforcement
actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these statutes, which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.  Anti-Kickback, Physician Self-Referral, and Other Fraud and Abuse Laws 
A federal law commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any
form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of Medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities, or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of items or services that are covered by Medicare
or other federal governmental health programs. Because the prohibitions contained in the Anti-Kickback Statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in whole or in part, the Anti-Kickback Statute could be
implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above. Violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include
exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the
Stark Law, prohibits physicians, subject to certain exceptions described below, from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing designated health services in which the physician, or an immediate family
member, has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has entered into a compensation arrangement. These prohibitions, contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, commonly known
as Stark II, amended prior federal physician self-referral legislation known as Stark I by 
  28 


Table of Contents

expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services. The professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated
health services. Persons or entities found to be in violation of the Stark Law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the Anti-Kickback Statute and, in more limited instances,
the Stark Law, that are not limited to services for which Medicare or Medicaid payment is made. In addition, most states have statutes, regulations, or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in
exchange for making referrals. These laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. In states that have enacted these statutes, we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts
interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law as persuasive.  We
believe that our operations comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse. These laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation, and are enforced by authorities
vested with broad discretion. We continually monitor developments in this area. If these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended, or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare
fraud and abuse, illegal remuneration, or similar issues, we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law. There can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or, if possible,
would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  Environmental
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and
the environment, including those governing the management and disposal of infectious medical waste and other waste generated at our subsidiary Concentras occupational healthcare centers and the cleanup of contamination. If an environmental
regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws, penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations. We could also incur other significant
costs, such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws. Although we believe that our environmental practices, including waste handling and disposal practices, are in material
compliance with applicable laws, future claims or violations, or changes in environmental laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
State Regulation of Insurance-Related Products  Laws in each of the states (and Puerto Rico) in which we operate our HMOs, PPOs and other health insurance-related services regulate our operations including: licensing requirements, policy language
describing benefits, mandated benefits and processes, entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market, rate increases, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim
payments, marketing, and advertising. The HMO, PPO, and other health insurance-related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators.  Our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or
notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports. 
Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our
parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is
limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 
  29 


Table of Contents
Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix,
and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. The amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately $970 million in the
aggregate. This compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately $740 million.  Any failure to manage operating costs could hamper profitability. 
The level of our operating costs impacts our profitability. While we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses, increases or
decreases in staff-related expenses, additional investment in new products (including our opportunities in the Medicare programs), greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products, investments in health and well-being product
offerings, expansion into new specialty markets, acquisitions, new taxes and assessments, including the new non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments under Health Insurance Reform Legislation, such as the three-year commercial
reinsurance fee, and implementation of regulatory requirements may occur from time to time.  There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully contain our operating costs in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
Any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in
discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives.
In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or
employees. Integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. In 2011, we acquired MD Care, Inc. and Anvita, Inc., and in 2010, we acquired
Concentra Inc. The failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. We may also be
at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business may be
adversely affected.  We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members.
Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. 
In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other
actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician
specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations, or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician 
  30 


Table of Contents

or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract
with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected. 
In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed,
per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members. This type of contract is referred to as a capitation contract. The inability of providers to properly manage
costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom
the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other
providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly
manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.  Our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face
with our core health benefits businesses.  Our pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores, retail
drugstore chains, supermarkets, discount retailers, membership clubs, and Internet companies as well as other mail-order and long-term care pharmacies. Our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. The
practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy. Many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances, have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail-order
pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy. In addition, some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies, and we may be subject to this legislation if it is passed. Federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy
operations. Pharmacies must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with
procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The U.S. Postal Service, or USPS, has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and
medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to
deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us. However, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on
drugs inserted in the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations. In addition, we are subject to CMS rules regarding the administration of our PDP plans and intercompany pricing between our PDP plans
and our pharmacy business.  We are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and
other health care products, and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mail-order pharmacies. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties.
 Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance.
 Contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for
prescription drugs. These benchmarks include average wholesale price, which is referred to as AWP, average selling price, which is referred to as ASP, and wholesale acquisition cost. Recent events have raised

  31 


Table of Contents

uncertainties as to whether payors, pharmacy providers, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize AWP as it has previously been
calculated, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulators have conducted investigations into the use of
AWP for federal program payment, and whether the use of AWP has inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. Adoption of ASP in lieu of AWP as the measure for determining payment by Medicare or Medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mail-order pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may
result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  If we do not
continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, our gross margins may decline.  We have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mail-order
and specialty pharmacies. These discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts. Changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the
adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is
restricted.  Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense
reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states Departments of Insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum
amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company. In most
states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the
state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. In the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows
may be materially adversely affected.  Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings
by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims
paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are
downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. In addition, our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of
the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and
ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such. 
  32 


Table of Contents
Historically, rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to, among other things,
perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, and possible
changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. In addition, rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixed-income products. As a result, rating agencies may
(i) become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, (ii) increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews, (iii) request additional information from the companies that they rate, or (iv) adjust upward the
capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.  We believe
that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings, and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded. In addition, our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on
favorable terms. If our credit ratings were to be lowered, our cost of borrowing likely would increase, our sales and earnings could decrease, and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
 Changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
 The U.S. economy continues to experience a period of slow economic growth and high unemployment. We have closely
monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our operations. Workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our fully-insured commercial group business. Continued weakness in the U.S. economy, and any continued
high unemployment, may materially adversely affect our medical membership, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Additionally, the continued weakness of the U.S. economy has adversely affected the budget of individual states and of the federal government. This could result in attempts to reduce payments in our
federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, military services, and Medicaid programs, and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover
our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.  In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and other
care, increasing the costs of claims expenses submitted to us.  The securities and credit markets may experience
volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect our business.  Volatility or disruption in the securities and
credit markets could impact our investment portfolio. We evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains
and losses, the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification. For debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the
intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, or if a credit loss has occurred. When we do not intend to sell a security in an
unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairments are considered using variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the
industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and
changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. We continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that
declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than- temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.

Certain European Union member states have total fiscal obligations greater than their
respective gross domestic products. This imbalance has caused investor concern over such countries ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Currently, the European debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen and
liquidity to tighten in the fixed income debt markets. A weaker European economy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies,
and likewise adversely affect U.S.-based financial institutions, the stability of the global financial markets, and the U.S. economy. We have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, or Greece. 
We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other
public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance or repay
debt. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in
our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Our
access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, both to the overall market and our industry, our credit ratings and debt capacity, as well as the possibility that
customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us. If a
combination of these factors were to occur, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.  Given the current economic climate, our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
 Over the past three years, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility.
Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have contributed to this volatility. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a
number of events and factors, including:   


 

 
 the enactment of, and the potential for additional, health insurance reform; 
 


 

 
 general economic conditions;   


 

 
 quarterly variations in operating results;   


 

 
 natural disasters, terrorist attacks and epidemics;   


 

 
 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; 
 


 

 
 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; 
 


 

 
 press releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in our markets; 
 


 

 
 regulatory changes and adverse outcomes from litigation and government or regulatory investigations; 
 


 

 
 sales of stock by insiders;   


 

 
 changes in our credit ratings;   


 

 
 limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; 
 


 

 
 increases in minimum capital, reserves, and other financial strength requirements; and 
 


 

 
 limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock.  These factors could materially reduce our stock price. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating
performance.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  In April 2011, the Board of Directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to $250 million with a new authorization for repurchases of up to $1 billion of our common
shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. The new authorization will expire June 30, 2013. Under the new share repurchase authorization, shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the
open market by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume, pricing, and timing. During 2011, we repurchased 0.8 million shares in open market transactions for $53 million at an
average price of $63.73 under the previously approved share repurchase authorization and we repurchased 5.9 million shares in open market transactions for $439 million at an average price of $74.01 under the new authorization. As of
February 6, 2012, the remaining authorized amount under the new authorization totaled $561 million.  In connection with
employee stock plans, we acquired 0.8 million common shares for $49 million in 2011.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Executive Overview  General 
Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health
and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong well-being. By leveraging the strengths of our core businesses, we believe that we can better explore opportunities for existing and emerging adjacencies in health care that
can further enhance wellness opportunities for the millions of people across the nation with whom we have relationships.  Our
industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating
cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. 
2011 Business Segment Realignment  During the first quarter of 2011, we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. As a result, we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first
quarter of 2011 to reflect managements view of the business and to align our external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial reporting model. Historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to
reflect the effect of this change. Our new reportable segments and the basis for determining those segments are discussed below.  Business Segments  We currently manage our business with three
reportable segments: Retail, Employer Group, and Health and Well-Being Services. In addition, we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting
principles in an Other Businesses category. These segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These
segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources.  The Retail segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection
products, marketed directly to individuals. The Employer Group segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial
protection products, as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups. The Health and Well-Being Services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and
wellness, including primary care, pharmacy, integrated wellness, and home care services. The Other Businesses category consists of our Military services, primarily our TRICARE South Region contract, Medicaid, and closed-block long-term care
businesses as well as our contract with CMS to administer the LI-NET program.  The results of each segment are measured by
income before income taxes. Transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our Health and Well-Being Services segment, primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services, to our Retail and Employer Group customers.
Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often 
  41 


Table of Contents

utilize the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the
profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting
segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at the corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment
eliminations.  Seasonality  Our Retail segment offers Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. These plans provide varying degrees of coverage. Our quarterly Retail segment earnings
and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a members cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass
through successive stages of a members plan period which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early
stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone
PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.  Our Employer Group segment also experiences seasonality in the
benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of the Retail segment, with the Employer Groups benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. 
2011 Highlights  Consolidated   


 

 
 Our strategy and commitment to the Medicare programs have led to significant growth as discussed in our Retail segment discussion below.
  


 

 
 As more fully described herein under the section titled Benefit Expense Recognition actuarial standards require the use of assumptions
based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of
business. We experienced favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development not in the ordinary course of business, primarily in our Retail and Employer Group segments, of approximately $205 million in the aggregate, or $0.77 per diluted
common share, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $231 million in the aggregate, or $0.86 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Any discussion of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve
development in our results of operation discussion that follows refers to amounts that were not in the ordinary course of business.   


 

 
 In April 2011, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy and we subsequently declared cash dividends of $0.25
per share to stockholders of record on each of June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, and December 30, 2011.   


 

 
 In addition, in April 2011, the Board of Directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to $250 million with a new
authorization for repurchases of up to $1 billion. The new authorization will expire June 30, 2013. As of February 6, 2012, the remaining authorized amount under the new authorization totaled $561 million. 
 


 

 
 Comparisons to 2010 are impacted by the $147 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical
policies during the year ended December 31, 2010

as well as the net charge of $139 million due to reserve strengthening for our closed block of long-term care policies as discussed more fully in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Retail Segment
  


 

 
 On February 17, 2012, CMS issued its Advance Notice for methodological changes for 2013 Medicare Advantage capitation rates and Part C and Part D
payment policies. We believe the Advance Notice indicates our payment rates from CMS will remain relatively unchanged from those for 2012, with the exception of the impact of any automatic rate reductions that would occur as a result of the
Budget Control Act of 2011. These potential automatic rate reductions were not addressed in the Advance notice, but we believe they would be primarily passed through as provider payment reductions from us. (For additional information, please
refer to the risk factor entitled, As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.) However, the
Advance Notice is subject to comment, and the final rates will not be published until the first Monday in April 2012. Nevertheless, we believe we can effectively design Medicare Advantage products based upon this level of rate increase while
continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original Medicare with a supplement policy as well as other Medicare Advantage competitors within our industry. In addition, we will continue to pursue our cost-reduction and
outcome-enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, which we believe will mitigate the adverse effects of the rates on our Medicare Advantage members. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.   


 

 
 Individual Medicare Advantage membership of 1,640,300 at December 31, 2011 increased 179,600 members, or 12.3%, from 1,460,700 at
December 31, 2010 primarily due to a successful enrollment season associated with the 2011 plan year. January 2012 individual Medicare Advantage membership of approximately 1,813,000 increased nearly 173,000 members, or approximately 11%, from
December 31, 2011, reflecting another successful enrollment season.   


 

 
 Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP membership of 2,540,400 at December 31, 2011 increased 870,100 members, or 52.1%, from 1,670,300 at
December 31, 2010 primarily due to sales of our new lowest premium national stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan co-branded with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan, that we began offering for the 2011 plan
year. January 2012 individual Medicare stand-alone PDP membership grew to approximately 2,825,000, increasing nearly 285,000 members, or approximately 11%, from December 31, 2011, also reflecting another successful selling season for the
co-branded Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan.   


 

 
 Comparisons to 2010 within the Retail segment are impacted by the $147 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual
commercial medical policies during the year ended December 31, 2010 as discussed above.   


 

 
 On December 6, 2011, we acquired Anvita, Inc., or Anvita, a San Diego-based health care analytics company. The Anvita acquisition provides
scalable analytics solutions that produce clinical insights which we believe will enhance our ability to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care for our members and customers. 
 


 

 
 Effective December 30, 2011, we acquired the California-based Medicare Advantage HMO MD Care, Inc., or MD Care. This acquisition expanded our
Medicare footprint in California and grew our Medicare enrollment by approximately 12,100 members.   


 

 
 During the second half of 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arcadian Management Services, Inc., which serves Medicare Advantage
HMO members in 15 U.S. states,

offering us an opportunity to further expand our Medicare footprint and grow our Medicare enrollment. The closing of this acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.

 During the second half of 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SeniorBridge, a chronic-care provider providing in-home care for
seniors that will expand our existing clinical and home health capabilities and strengthen our offerings for members with complex chronic-care needs. The closing of this acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. 
 


 

 
 In 2011, we launched HumanaVitality, a joint venture with Discovery Holdings Ltd., providing our members with access to a science-based, actuarially
driven wellness and loyalty program that features a wide range of well-being tools and rewards that are customized to an individuals needs and wants.  Other Businesses

 As more fully discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the new TRICARE South Region contract to us, which we expect to take effect on April 1, 2012. The new 5-year South Region contract, which
expires March 31, 2017, is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year during its term at the governments option.  Health Insurance Reform  In March 2010, the President signed
into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of
the U.S. health insurance industry. While regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation have been issued to date by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, the
Treasury Department, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to
fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business, which we expect to occur over the next several years. 
Implementation dates of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation vary from September 23, 2010 to as late as 2018. The following
outlines certain provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation:   


 

 
 Changes effective for plan years which began on or after September 23, 2010 included: elimination of pre-existing condition limits for enrollees
under age 19, elimination of certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of benefits, expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age 26, a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members,
new claim appeal requirements, and the establishment of an interim high risk program for those unable to obtain coverage due to a pre-existing condition or health status. 
 


 

 
 Effective January 1, 2011, minimum benefit ratios were mandated for all commercial fully-insured medical plans in the large group (85%), small
group (80%), and individual (80%) markets, with annual rebates to policyholders if the actual benefit ratios, calculated in a manner prescribed by HHS, do not meet these minimums. Certain states were approved to apply an individual threshold
lower than the 80% requirement temporarily to avoid market disruption. In 2011, we accrued for rebates, based on the 
  44 


Table of Contents


 
 
manner prescribed by HHS, with initial rebate payments to be made in mid-2012. Our benefit ratios reported herein, calculated from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, differ from the benefit ratios calculated as prescribed by HHS under the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. The more noteworthy differences include the fact that the benefit
ratio calculations prescribed by HHS are calculated separately by state and legal entity; reflect actuarial adjustments where the membership levels are not large enough to create credible size; exclude some of our health insurance products; include
taxes and fees as reductions of premium; treat changes in reserves differently than GAAP; and classify rebate amounts as additions to incurred claims as opposed to adjustments to premiums for GAAP reporting. 
 


 

 
 Medicare Advantage payment benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels and beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plan payments
will begin to take effect (plans will receive a range of 95% in high-cost areas to 115% in low-cost areas of Medicare fee-for-service rates), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a
county. In addition, beginning in 2011, the gap in coverage for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage began to incrementally close.   


 

 
 Beginning in 2014, the Health Insurance Reform Legislation requires: all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew
coverage without pre-existing condition exclusions or health-status rating adjustments; the elimination of annual limits on coverage on certain plans; the establishment of state-based exchanges for individuals and small employers (with up to 100
employees) coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers; the introduction of standardized plan designs based on set actuarial values; the establishment of a minimum benefit ratio of 85% for Medicare plans; and insurance industry
assessments, including an annual premium-based assessment and a three-year commercial reinsurance fee. The annual premium-based assessment levied on the insurance industry is $8 billion in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter and is not
deductible for income tax purposes, which will significantly increase our effective income tax rate in 2014. In December 2011, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, issued proposed guidance indicating the insurance industry
premium-based assessment may require accrual and associated subsidiary funding consideration in 2013 instead of 2014. This proposed NAIC guidance is contradictory to final GAAP guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, in
July 2011, which indicates the insurance industry premium-based assessment should be accrued beginning in 2014, the year in which it is payable. Refer to Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The Health
Insurance Reform Legislation also specifies required benefit designs, limits rating and pricing practices, encourages additional competition (including potential incentives for new market entrants) and expands eligibility for Medicaid
programs. In addition, the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis. Financing for these reforms
will come, in part, from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and individuals beginning in 2014, as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under Medicare as described
herein.  In addition, certain provisions in the Health Insurance Reform Legislation tie Medicare Advantage premiums to the
achievement of certain quality performance measures (Star Ratings). Beginning in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans with an overall Star Rating of three or more stars (out of five) will be eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates.
Initially quality bonuses were limited to the few plans that achieved four or more stars as an overall rating, but CMS has expanded the quality bonus to three Star plans for a three year period through 2014. Recent Star Ratings issued by CMS
indicated that 98% of our Medicare Advantage members are now in plans that will qualify for quality bonus payments in 2013. Notwithstanding successful efforts to improve our Star Ratings and other quality measures for 2012 and 2013 and the
continuation of such efforts, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our Star Ratings in 
  45 


Table of Contents

future years. Accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership, and/or reduce profit
margins.  As discussed above, implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several
significant provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. The implementation of the individual mandate as well as Medicaid expansion in the Health Insurance Reform Legislation are also being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to
have all or portions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. We cannot predict the results of these proceedings. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Insurance Reform Legislation, or
may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether. Given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation, implementation, and timing of these changes, which we expect to occur over the
next several years, the Health Insurance Reform Legislation could change the way we do business, potentially impacting our pricing, benefit design, product mix, geographic mix, and distribution channels. In particular, implementing regulations and
related guidance are forthcoming on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirements applicability to Medicare, including aggregation, credibility thresholds, and its possible application to prescription drug plans. The response of
other companies to the Health Insurance Reform Legislation and adjustments to their offerings, if any, could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the
state level. It is reasonably possible that the Health Insurance Reform Legislation and related regulations, as well as future legislative changes, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including
restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our
expenses associated with the non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments; our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill; and our cash flows. If the new non-deductible federal premium tax and other
assessments, including a three-year commercial reinsurance fee, were imposed as enacted, and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments, such as through the reduction of our operating costs, there can be
no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our
financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services
rendered by our Health and Well-Being Services segment, primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services, to our Retail and Employer Group customers and are described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

2011 compared to $1.1 billion, or $6.47 per diluted common share, in 2010 primarily due to improved operating performance in the Retail and Health and Well-Being Services segments and the negative impact of certain charges described below on 2010
results that did not recur in 2011. Share repurchase activity also contributed to the year-over-year increase in diluted  earnings per common
share. Our diluted earnings per common share include the beneficial impact of favorable

prior-period medical claims reserve development of approximately $0.77 per diluted common share for 2011 compared to $0.86 per diluted common share for 2010. Net income for the 2010 period also
included the negative impact of a $147 million ($0.55 per diluted common share) write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our Retail Segment, and a net charge of $139 million ($0.52 per
diluted common share) for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care policies in our Other Businesses as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.  Premiums Revenue  Consolidated premiums increased $2.4 billion, or 7.3%, from 2010 to $35.1 billion for 2011, primarily due to an increase in Retail segment premiums, partially offset by a decline in Employer Group segment
premiums. The increase in Retail segment premiums primarily resulted from higher average individual Medicare Advantage membership. The decrease in Employer Group segment premiums primarily resulted from lower average fully-insured commercial group
medical membership. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and increases in average
per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership.
 Services Revenue  Consolidated services revenue increased $805 million, or 145.0%, from 2010 to $1.4 billion for 2011, primarily due to an increase in primary care services revenue in our Health and Well-Being Services
segment, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Concentra on December 21, 2010.  Investment Income
 Investment income totaled $366 million for 2011, an increase of $37 million from 2010, primarily reflecting higher
interest rates as well as higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows. 
Benefit Expenses  Consolidated benefit expenses were $28.8 billion for 2011, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 6.3%, from 2010. The increases were primarily due to a $1.8 billion, or 11.3%, year-over-year increase in Retail
segment benefit expenses in 2011, primarily driven by an increase in the average number of Medicare members, partially offset by a decline in Employer Group segment benefit expenses. 
The consolidated benefit ratio for 2011 was 82.1%, declining 80 basis points from the 2010 benefit ratio of 82.9%, primarily driven by a
decline in the Retail segment benefit ratio and a net charge for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care policies in our Other Businesses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011. 
Operating Costs  Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each
segment is interdependent.  Consolidated operating costs increased $1.0 billion, or 23.2%, during 2011 compared to 2010,
primarily due an increase in operating costs in our Health and Well-Being Segment as a result of the acquisition of Concentra on December 21, 2010, as well as an increase in operating costs in our Retail segment as a result of increased
expenses associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. Operating costs for 2010 include $147 million for the write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our Retail
Segment. 
  48 


Table of Contents
The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2011 was 14.8%, increasing 160 basis points from
the 2010 operating cost ratio of 13.2%. The $147 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 increased the operating cost ratio 50 basis points for 2010. Excluding the impact of the write-down of deferred acquisition costs in 2010, the
increase primarily reflects the greater percentage of our revenues derived from Concentra, acquired December 21, 2010, in our Health and Well-Being Services segment, which carries a higher operating cost ratio on external revenues than our
other segments, as well as an increase in the Retail and Employer Group segment operating cost ratios.  Depreciation and
Amortization  Depreciation and amortization for 2011 totaled $270 million, an increase of $25 million, or 10.2%, from 2010,
primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization expense associated with our Concentra operations, acquired on December 21, 2010.  Interest Expense  Interest expense was $109 million for 2011, compared to
$105 million for 2010, an increase of $4 million, or 3.8%.  Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate during 2011 was 36.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 37.2% in 2010. The higher tax rate for 2010 primarily
was due to the cumulative adjustment associated with estimating the retrospective aspect of new limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $500,000 per employee as mandated by the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. See
Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

 Pretax Results   


 

 
 Retail segment pretax income was $1.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $298 million, or 23.1%, from $1.3 billion in 2010, primarily driven by higher
average individual Medicare membership and a lower benefit ratio, partially offset by a higher operating cost ratio, discussed below. Pretax income for 2010 included the negative impact of a $147 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs
associated with our individual commercial medical policies. In addition, the Retail segments pretax income for 2011 included the beneficial effect of an estimated $147 million in favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development versus
$198 million in 2010.  Enrollment 
 


 

 
 Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 179,600 members, or 12.3%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 due to a successful
enrollment season associated with the 2011 plan year as well as age-in enrollment throughout the year. Individual Medicare Advantage membership at December 31, 2011 included approximately 12,100 members acquired with our acquisition of MD Care
as of December 30, 2011.   


 

 
 Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 870,100 members, or 52.1%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 primarily
from higher gross sales year-over-year, particularly due to our low-price-point Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan that we began offering for the 2011 plan year, supplemented by dual eligible and age-in enrollments throughout the year.
  


 

 
 Individual specialty membership increased 272,500, or 53.4%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 primarily driven by increased sales
in dental offerings.  Premiums revenue 
 


 

 
 Retail segment premiums increased $2.4 billion, or 12.3%, from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to a 10.3% increase in average individual Medicare Advantage
membership. Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums revenue increased $358 million, or 18.3%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a 41.9% increase in average individual PDP membership, partially offset by a decrease in individual Medicare
stand-alone PDP per member premiums. This was primarily a result of sales of our low-price-point Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan that we began offering for the 2011 plan year.

Table of Contents
Benefit expenses 
 


 

 
 The Retail segment benefit ratio decreased 80 basis points from 82.0% in 2010 to 81.2% in 2011. The decline primarily reflects a lower Medicare
Advantage benefit ratio due to lower cost trends arising out of our cost-reduction and outcome-enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, as well as a significant increase in our individual Medicare stand-alone PDP
membership in 2011 that carries a lower benefit ratio, partially offset by lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2011 than in 2010. Favorable reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by
approximately 70 basis points in 2011 versus approximately 100 basis points in 2010.  Operating costs
  


 

 
 The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 11.2% for 2011 increased 10 basis points from 11.1% for 2010. The $147 million write-down of deferred
acquisition costs in 2010 increased the operating cost ratio 80 basis points in 2010. Excluding the impact of the write-down of deferred acquisition costs, the increase in the operating cost ratio year-over-year primarily reflects increased expenses
associated with the Medicare sales season for 2012 offerings which began a month earlier than in the prior year and staffing necessary to service anticipated Medicare membership additions. Further, a higher percentage of membership in individual
Medicare stand-alone PDP products contributed to the higher operating cost ratio, in light of the Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan, first offered in 2011, which carries a higher operating cost ratio than other Medicare products.

 Pretax Results   


 

 
 Employer Group segment pretax income decreased $46 million, or 16%, to $242 million in 2011 primarily due to the impact of minimum benefit ratios
required under the Health Insurance Reform Legislation which became effective in 2011. The Employer Group segments pretax income for 2011 included the beneficial effect of an estimated $52 million in favorable prior-period medical claims
reserve development versus $33 million in 2010.  Enrollment 
 


 

 
 Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 72,000 members, or 5.7%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 primarily
due to continued pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment for large group business partially offset by small group business membership gains. 
 


 

 
 Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 161,300 members, or 11.1%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 primarily due to
continued pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment for self-funded accounts.  Premiums
revenue   


 

 
 Employer Group segment premiums decreased by $203 million, or 2.2%, from 2010 to $8.9 billion for 2011 primarily due to lower average commercial group
medical membership year-over-year and rebates associated with minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Insurance Reform Legislation which became effective in 2011, partially offset by an increase in group Medicare Advantage membership.
Rebates result in the recognition of lower premiums revenue, as amounts are set aside for payments to commercial customers during the following year.  Benefit expenses   


 

 
 The Employer Group segment benefit ratio of 82.4% for 2011 was unchanged from 2010 due to offsetting factors. Factors increasing the 2011 ratio
compared to the 2010 ratio include growth in our group Medicare Advantage products which generally carry a higher benefit ratio than our fully-insured commercial group products and the effect of rebates accrued in 2011 associated with the minimum
benefit ratios required under the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. Factors decreasing the 2011 
  52 


Table of Contents


 
 
ratio compared to the 2010 ratio include the beneficial effect of higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2011 versus 2010 and lower utilization of benefits in our
commercial group products in 2011. Fully-insured group Medicare Advantage members represented 10.4% of total Employer Group segment medical membership at December 31, 2011 compared to 9.1% at December 31, 2010. Favorable reserve
development decreased the Employer Group segment benefit ratio by approximately 60 basis points in 2011 versus 40 basis points in 2010.  Operating costs   


 

 
 The Employer Group segment operating cost ratio of 17.8% for 2011 increased 30 basis points from 17.5% for 2010 primarily reflecting the impact of
lower premiums revenue due to the minimum benefit ratio regulatory requirements which became effective in 2011.

Operating costs 
 


 

 
 The Health and Well-Being Services segment operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points from 2010 to 96.1% for 2011 reflecting scale efficiencies
associated with growth in our pharmacy solutions business together with the addition of our acquired Concentra operations which carry a lower operating cost ratio than other lines of business in this segment. 
Other Businesses 
Pretax income for our Other Businesses of $84 million for 2011 compared to pretax losses of $2 million for 2010. Pretax losses for 2010
include the impact of a net charge of $139 million associated with reserve strengthening for our closed block of long-term care policies. Excluding this charge, the year-over-year decline primarily reflects a decrease in pretax income associated
with our contract with CMS to administer the LI-NET program.  Comparison of Results of Operations for 2010 and 2009

Table of Contents
Summary  Net income was $1.1 billion, or $6.47 per diluted common share, in 2010 compared to $1.0 billion, or $6.15 per diluted common share, in 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in average Medicare
Advantage membership and favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2010 in both our Retail and Employer Group segments. Our diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include the beneficial impact of favorable prior-period medical
claims reserve development of approximately $0.86 per diluted common share. These increases were partially offset by a $147 million ($0.55 per diluted common share) write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial
medical policies in our Retail segment and a net charge of $139 million ($0.52 per diluted common share) for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care policies in our Other Businesses in 2010 as discussed in Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Net income for 2009 also included the favorable impact of the reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits ($0.10 per
diluted common share) as a result of Internal Revenue Service audit settlements.  Premiums revenue 
Consolidated premiums increased $2.8 billion, or 9.3%, from 2009 to $32.7 billion for 2010. The increase primarily was due to higher
premiums revenue in the Employer Group and Retail segments primarily as a result of higher average Medicare Advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums, as well as increased premiums for Other Businesses as a result of our new
contract with CMS to administer the LI-NET program in 2010.  Services Revenue 
Consolidated services revenue increased $35 million, or 6.7%, from 2009 to $555 million for 2010, primarily due to an increase in services
revenue in our Employer Group segment primarily as a result of a new group Medicare ASO account in 2010 partially offset by a decline in commercial ASO membership, as well as an increase in primary care services revenue in our Health and Well-Being
Services segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of Concentra on December 21, 2010.  Investment Income
 Investment income totaled $329 million for 2010, an increase of $33 million from $296 million for 2009, primarily
reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows, partially offset by lower interest rates.  Benefit Expenses  Consolidated benefit expenses were $27.1 billion for
2010, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 9.4%, from $24.8 billion for 2009. The increase primarily was driven by an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members.  The consolidated benefit ratio for 2010 was 82.9%, essentially unchanged, increasing only 10 basis points from the 2009 benefit ratio of 82.8%. 
Operating Costs  Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each
segment is interdependent.  Consolidated operating costs increased $366 million, or 9.1%, during 2010 compared to 2009,
primarily due to the $147 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical

policies in 2010, increased Medicare investment spending for our 2011 offerings, and operating costs associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by a
decrease in the number of our employees as a result of our administrative cost reduction strategies, including planned workforce reductions in 2010. Excluding employees added with the acquisition of Concentra on December 21, 2010, the number of
employees decreased by 800 to 27,300 at December 31, 2010 from 28,100 at December 31, 2009, or 2.8%, as we aligned the size of our workforce with our membership.  The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2010 of 13.2% remained unchanged from the 2009 ratio as an increase in the Retail segment operating cost ratio was offset by declines in the Employer Group and
Health and Well-Being Services segment operating cost ratios.  Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization for 2010 totaled $245 million compared to $237 million for 2009, an increase of $8 million, or 3.4%,
primarily reflecting depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures.  Interest Expense 
Interest expense was $105 million for 2010, compared to $106 million for 2009, a decrease of $1 million, or 0.9%. 
Income Taxes  Our effective tax rate during 2010 was 37.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 35.1% in 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 primarily was due to the reduction of the $17 million liability for
unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements which reduced the effective income tax rate by 1.0% during 2009. In addition, the tax rate for 2010 reflects the estimated impact of new limitations on the deductibility of annual
compensation in excess of $500,000 per employee as mandated by recent health insurance reforms. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete
reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.  Retail Segment

 Pretax Results   


 

 
 Retail segment pretax income was $1.3 billion in 2010, a decrease of $70 million, or 5.2%, from 2009 primarily due to the negative impact of a $147
million write-down of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in 2010 and a decline in average individual Medicare stand-alone PDP membership from 2009 to 2010, partially offset by the beneficial impact
of an estimated $198 million in favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2010. 
Enrollment   


 

 
 Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 54,100 members, or 3.8%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, with sales of our
PPO products driving the majority of the increase.   


 

 
 Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP membership decreased 255,100 members, or 13.2%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 primarily
from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience. 
 


 

 
 Individual specialty membership increased 212,700, or 71.5%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, primarily driven by increased sales
in dental and vision offerings.  Premiums revenue 
 


 

 
 Retail segment premiums increased $703 million, or 3.8%, from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher average individual Medicare Advantage membership and
an increase in per member premiums, partially offset by a decline in average individual stand-alone PDP membership. Individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue increased $932 million, or 6.1%, from 2009 to 2010. Average individual Medicare
Advantage membership increased 4.4% in 2010 compared to 2009. Individual Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased approximately 1.6% during 2010 compared to 2009. Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums revenue decreased $364 million,
or 15.7%, from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to a 14.8% decrease in average individual PDP membership. 
Benefit expenses   


 

 
 The Retail segment benefit ratio increased 30 basis points from 81.7% in 2009 to 82.0% in 2010 primarily driven by a 40 basis point increase in the
Medicare benefit ratio primarily as a result of 
  57 


Table of Contents


 
 
higher average membership in products that generally carry higher benefit ratios, partially offset by favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development. This favorable development
decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in 2010.  Operating costs
  


 

 
 The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 11.1% for 2010 increased 30 basis points from 10.8% for 2009. The $147 million write-down of deferred
acquisition costs in 2010 increased the operating cost ratio 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of the write-down of deferred acquisition costs, the decrease in the operating cost ratio year-over-year primarily reflects efficiency gains
associated with servicing higher average individual Medicare Advantage membership as well as our continued focus on administrative cost reductions, partially offset by increased Medicare investment spending for our 2011 offerings.

Pretax Results 
 


 

 
 Employer Group segment pretax income of $288 million in 2010 increased $301 million from 2009 primarily due to an increase in group Medicare Advantage
membership, decreased utilization and our continued focus on pricing discipline primarily associated with our fully-insured commercial group products, as well as administrative cost reductions and the previously mentioned favorable prior-period
medical claims reserve development. The Employer Group segments pretax income for 2010 included the beneficial effect of an estimated $33 million in favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development. 
Enrollment   


 

 
 Fully-insured group Medicare Advantage membership increased 171,200 members from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Approximately
109,600 of the members were associated with a new contract added during the first quarter of 2010.   


 

 
 During 2010, we added 28,200 group Medicare Advantage ASO members due to a new account in 2010. 
 


 

 
 Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 189,900 members, or 13.2%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 primarily
due to continued pricing discipline.   


 

 
 Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 117,700 members, or 7.5%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 primarily reflecting
the loss of a large group account on July 1, 2010.  Premiums revenue 
 


 

 
 Employer Group segment premiums increased $1.6 billion, or 21.6%, from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to increased fully-insured group Medicare Advantage
membership and an increase in fully-insured commercial group per member premiums, partially offset by a decline in fully-insured commercial group medical membership year-over-year. Per member premiums for commercial fully-insured group accounts
increased 7.6% during 2010 compared to 2009.  Benefit expenses 
 


 

 
 The Employer Group segment benefit ratio of 82.4% for 2010 decreased 180 basis points from 84.2% for 2009 primarily due to medical trend that was lower
than trend assumed in pricing as well as continued pricing discipline, in each case particularly for our commercial business, and favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2010. These decreases were partially offset by growth in
our group Medicare Advantage business which generally carries a higher benefit ratio than our fully-insured commercial group business. Medical trend was favorable, primarily affected by lower utilization of services as well as the use of services at
lower levels of intensity than in the prior year. The favorable development decreased the Employer Group segment benefit ratio by approximately 40 basis points in 2010. Fully-insured group Medicare Advantage members represented 9.1% of total
Employer Group segment medical membership at December 31, 2010 compared to 3.3% at December 31, 2009.  Operating costs   


 

 
 The Employer Group segment operating cost ratio of 17.5% for 2010 decreased 200 basis points from 19.5% for 2009 primarily reflecting administrative
scale efficiencies associated with an increase in average fully-insured group Medicare Advantage membership and our continued focus on administrative cost reductions.

 Pretax results   


 

 
 Health and Well-Being Services segment pretax income increased $36 million, or 19.7%, from 2009 to $219 million in 2010 primarily due to growth in both
our mail order pharmacy business and our CAC medical centers. The opening of our new facility for processing specialty prescription drugs in late 2009 and continued growth from our processing facility opened in 2008 contributed to the growth in our
mail order business in 2010.  Services revenue 
 


 

 
 Services revenue increased $17 million, or 100.0%, from 2009 to $34 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in primary care services revenue
primarily as a result of the acquisition of Concentra on December 21, 2010.  Intersegment revenues
  


 

 
 Intersegment revenues decreased $166 million, or 1.9%, from 2009 to $8.8 billion for 2010 primarily due to a decline in our pharmacy solutions business
primarily as a result of a decrease in average Medicare stand-alone PDP membership from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience.
 Operating costs   


 

 
 The Health and Well-Being Services segment operating cost ratio decreased 60 basis points from 2009 to 97.2% for 2010 reflecting growth in our CAC
medical centers as well as LifeSynch, our integrated behavioral health and wellness business, which carry lower operating cost ratios than other lines of business in this segment. 
Other Businesses  Pretax losses for our Other Businesses of $2 million for 2010 compared to pretax income of $97 million for 2009. The decline in operating performance from 2009 to 2010 primarily resulted from a net charge
of $139 million

associated with reserve strengthening for our closed block of long-term care policies in 2010, partially offset by pretax income in 2010 associated with our new contract with CMS to administer
the LI-NET program, under which we began providing services in the first quarter of 2010.  Liquidity 
Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, services revenues, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the
sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures,
repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of
increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items. The use
of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent.
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2011 from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010.
The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:

 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
The change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings, enrollment
activity, and changes in working capital items as discussed below. Cash flows were positively impacted by Medicare enrollment gains in 2011 and 2010 because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several
months. Conversely, during 2009, cash flows were negatively impacted by the payment of run-off claims associated with enrollment losses in our stand-alone PDP business.  Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of
benefit expenses and receipts for premiums. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables.  The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

Table of Contents
   


(1)
IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by
membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR).



(2)
Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the payment to the provider. A
corresponding receivable for reimbursement by the federal government is included in the base receivable in the receivables table that follows. 


(3)
Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative
functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. 


(4)
Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements. 
The increase in benefits payable in 2011 primarily was due to an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims, including amounts
due to our pharmacy benefit administrator, which fluctuate due to month-end cutoff, and an increase in Military services benefits payable. The increase in benefits payable in 2010 and 2009 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to
providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in IBNR, both primarily as a result of Medicare Advantage membership growth, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims, including
pharmacy claims, which fluctuate due to the month-end cutoff.  The detail of total net receivables was as follows at

 Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for
health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in
the $42 million increase in base receivables for 2011 as compared to 2010, the $26 million decrease in base receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009, and the $15 million increase in base receivables for 2009 as compared to 2008. 
Medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model.

  62 


Table of Contents
Commercial and other receivables for 2011 and 2010 include $144 million and $109 million,
respectively, of patient services receivables acquired with the acquisition of Concentra in December 2010. In addition, the allowance for doubtful accounts increased $33 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to the Concentra acquisition. The
increase in Concentra receivables and the related allowance in 2011 result from the requirement to record acquired balances at fair value at the acquisition date. Excluding the receivables acquired with Concentra, the timing of reimbursements from
the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration for our Medicaid business primarily resulted in the increase in commercial and other receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 followed by a decrease from 2010 to 2011. 
In addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and services fees and payments of benefit expenses, other working capital items
impacting operating cash flows over the past three years primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions of our contracts with CMS as well as changes in the timing of collections of pharmacy rebates.
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities  We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily investment-grade fixed income securities, totaling $850 million in 2011, $827 million in 2010, and $2.0 billion in
2009. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our Concentra and other medical facilities and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing,
billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $346 million in 2011, $222 million in 2010, and $185 million in 2009, with 2011
reflecting increased spending associated with growth in our primary care services and pharmacy businesses in our Health and Well-Being Services segment. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately $350
million. Cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $226 million in 2011, $833 million in 2010, and $12 million in 2009 primarily related to the Anvita and MD Care acquisitions in 2011 and the Concentra acquisition in 2010.
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities  Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $378 million less than claims payments during 2011, $237 million less than claim payments during
2010, and $493 million higher than claims payments during 2009. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further description. 
During 2011, we repurchased 6.7 million shares for $492 million under the stock repurchase plans authorized by the Board of
Directors in December 2009 and April 2011. During 2010, we repurchased 1.99 million shares for $100 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2009. We also acquired common shares in connection with
employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of $49 million in 2011, $8 million in 2010, and $23 million in 2009.  During 2011,
we paid dividends to stockholders of $82 million as discussed further below. No dividends were paid during 2010 or 2009.  In
2009, net borrowings under our then existing credit agreement decreased $250 million primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund a 2008 acquisition.  The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2011, 2010, and 2009 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises, the change in the book overdraft, and the change
in the securities lending payable. The decrease in securities lending since 2009 resulted from lower margins earned under the program which terminated in the fourth quarter of 2011.

 Stock Repurchase Authorization 
In April 2011, the Board of Directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to $250 million with a new
authorization for repurchases of up to $1 billion of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. The new authorization will expire June 30, 2013. Under the new share repurchase authorization,
shares could be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume, pricing, and timing. As of February 6, 2012,
the remaining authorized amount under the new authorization totaled $561 million.  Senior Notes 
We previously issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016, $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018,
$300 million of 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018, and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are
downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. All four series of our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any
time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. Our senior notes are more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.  Credit Agreement  In November 2011, we amended and restated our 3-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which was set to expire in December 2013 and replaced it with a 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured
revolving agreement expiring November 2016. Under the new credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either LIBOR plus a spread or
the base rate plus a spread. The LIBOR spread, currently 120 basis points, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 87.5 to 147.5 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently
17.5 basis points, may fluctuate between 12.5 and 27.5 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate
or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option.  The terms of the new credit agreement include standard provisions related
to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the new credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as
customary

events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0:1. We are
in compliance with the financial covenants, with actual net worth of $8.1 billion and actual leverage ratio of 0.6:1, as measured in accordance with the new credit agreement as of December 31, 2011. In addition, the new credit agreement
includes an uncommitted $250 million incremental loan facility.  At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding
under the new credit agreement. We have outstanding letters of credit of $14 million secured under the new credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2011, we had $986 million of
remaining borrowing capacity under the new credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some
parties to the credit agreement.  Other Long-Term Borrowings 
Other long-term borrowings of $36 million at December 31, 2011 represent junior subordinated debt. The junior subordinated debt,
which is due in 2037, may be called by us without penalty in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. 
Liquidity Requirements  We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide
adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares. 
Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the
future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2011 was BBB according to Standard & Poors Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moodys Investors Services, Inc., or Moodys. A downgrade by
S&P to BB+ or by Moodys to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual
interest expense by $2 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $8 million.  In addition, we
operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to
maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company were $494 million at December 31, 2011 and
$553 million at December 31, 2010. During 2011, our subsidiaries paid dividends of $1.1 billion to the parent compared to $747 million in 2010 and $774 million in 2009. Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in
Schedule I  Parent Company Financial Information. As described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled Health Insurance Reform, in December
2011, the NAIC issued proposed guidance indicating the insurance industry premium-based assessment may require accrual and associated subsidiary funding consideration in 2013 instead of 2014. This proposed NAIC guidance is contradictory to final
GAAP guidance issued by the FASB in July 2011, which indicates the insurance industry premium-based assessment should be accrued beginning in 2014, the year in which it is payable. 
Regulatory Requirements  Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as
limit investments

to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the
entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 
Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum
requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which exceeded
aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. The amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately $970 million in the aggregate. This compares to dividends that
were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately $740 million.  Contractual Obligations

Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements. 


(2)
We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through
2025. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we
acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. 


(3)
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case
that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction.
Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. 


(4)
Includes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We expect the assuming reinsurance carriers to fund these obligations and reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets
on our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts payable in less than one year are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. 


(5)
Excludes the pending acquisitions of Arcadian Management Services, Inc. and SeniorBridge, both announced in the second half of 2011 and subject to regulatory approval.
Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other
contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. 
Guarantees and Indemnifications  Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for
(1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has
guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the
particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have
been immaterial.  Government Contracts  Our Medicare products, which accounted for approximately 65% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily consisted of products covered under the
Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar
year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare products
have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2012 have been approved.  CMS uses a
risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans
are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the governments original
Medicare program. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed
deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to Medicare Advantage plans. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to
CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. 
CMS is continuing to perform audits of various companies selected Medicare Advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment
diagnosis data. These audits are referred to herein as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment
conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans. 
  67 


Table of Contents
On December 21, 2010, CMS posted a description of the agencys proposed RADV
sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website, and invited public comment, noting that CMS may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received. We believe the audit and payment
adjustment methodology proposed by CMS is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound. In essence, in making the comparison referred to above, CMS relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans:
(1) fee for service (FFS) data from the governments original Medicare program; and (2) MA data. The proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data (MA data), while not performing the same exercise on the
other set (FFS data). However, because these two sets of data are inextricably linked, we believe CMS must audit and validate both of them before determining the financial implications of any potential RADV audit results, in order to ensure that any
resulting payment adjustment is accurate. We believe that the Social Security Act, under which the payment model was established, requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining risk-adjusted payments to MA plans. Furthermore, our
payment received from CMS, as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members, is based on bids that did not, by CMS design, include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. We believe that applying a retroactive audit
adjustment after CMS acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums.  CMS
has received public comments, including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the American Academy of Actuaries, which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data. On February 3,
2011, CMS issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received, although we are unable to predict the extent of
changes that they may make.  To date, six Humana contracts have been selected by CMS for RADV audits for the 2007 contract
year, consisting of one pilot audit and five targeted audits for Humana plans. We believe that the proposed methodology for these audits is actuarially unsound and in violation of the Social Security Act. We intend to defend
that position vigorously. However, if CMS moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data inconsistency issues described above, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues
derived from the Medicare Advantage program and, therefore, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  At
December 31, 2011, our military services business, which accounted for approximately 10% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract. The
original 5-year South Region contract expired on March 31, 2009 and was extended through March 31, 2012. On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the new TRICARE South Region
contract to us, which we expect to take effect on April 1, 2012. The new 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2017, is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year during its term at the governments
option.  Under the current TRICARE South Region contract, any variance from the negotiated target health care cost is shared
with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of
persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health
care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the
vast majority in Puerto Rico. Effective October 1, 2010, as amended in May 2011, the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, or PRHIA, awarded us three contracts for the East, Southeast, and Southwest regions for a three year term through
June 30, 2013.

Table of Contents
The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result
of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment
securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical
accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Benefit Expense Recognition  Benefit expenses are recognized in the
period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows:

 Military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services
provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This amount is
generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government, as more fully-described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled Cash
Flow from Operating Activities.  Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in
this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results of operations and overall financial position. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member
receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail. As such, we expect that substantially all of the December 31, 2011 estimate of benefits
payable will be known and paid during 2012.  Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point
estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being
insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an 
  69 


Table of Contents

assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time
of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.  We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply
a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting
for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the
reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known
changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, changes in medical management processes, product mix, and weekday seasonality. 
The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical
percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level
sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including recoveries of overpayments, receipt cycle times, claim inventory
levels, outsourcing, system conversions, and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. Claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment
recoveries for claims paid previously, as contractually allowed. Claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors, including retroactive enrollment activity, audits of provider billings and/or payment errors. Changes in patterns
of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility, as they often impact older dates of service. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially
incurred and when the claim form was received. Increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last several years. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior
periods, the actual claim may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using our completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required. 
Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include
increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, and new prescription drugs and therapies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these
expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, the tort liability system, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical
services, an aging population, lifestyle changes including diet and smoking, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management
practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member
per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods
over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. 
The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of
IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most

recent three months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse
experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2011 data:

(a)
The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change.  As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on
moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. The amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our Medicare
products, coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. 
During 2011 and 2010, we experienced prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of approximately $205
million and $231 million, respectively. This favorable reserve development primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and, to a lesser extent, better than originally estimated utilization. In addition, in 2010, a
shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions was a contributing factor. The improvements in the claims processing environment benefited all lines of business during 2011, but were most prominent in our Medicare PFFS line
of business in 2010. As a result of these improvements, we experienced a significant increase in claim overpayment recoveries during 2011 for claims with 2010 and 2009 dates of service and during 2010 for claims with 2009 and 2008 dates of service,
primarily as a result of increased audits of provider billings, as well as system enhancements that improved the claim recovery functionality. This increase resulted in our historical completion factors being understated for those periods since they
had been developed using our previous historical experience. The remaining reserve redundancy primarily resulted from our consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as
described above. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable. 
We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current
trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards,
there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2011 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table.
 Benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the
previous table were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

 Our current TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial
portion of the risk of financing health benefits. The federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80% of any variance from the annual targeted health care cost and actual health care
cost as more fully described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of 
  72 


Table of Contents

Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled Military Services. Therefore, the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for TRICARE
benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues. The net change in income from operations as determined retrospectively, after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period, was a
decrease of approximately $14 million for 2010 and an increase of approximately $9 million for 2009. The impact from changes in estimates for 2011 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2012 will change as our
December 31, 2011 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2012.  Future policy benefits payable of $1.7 billion and
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, represent liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including long-term care, life insurance, annuities, and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for
which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and
maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired
and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability, together with the present value of future gross premiums, are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits. 
Future policy benefits payable include $938 million at December 31, 2011 and $825 million at December 31, 2010 associated with
a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the November 30, 2007 KMG acquisition. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after
assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care policies. We monitor the loss experience of
these long-term care policies and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. To the extent premium rate increases and/or loss experience
vary from our acquisition date assumptions, future adjustments to reserves could be required. During the fourth quarter of 2010, certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our long-term care block that were significantly
below our acquisition date assumptions. Based on these actions by the states, combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions, we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable,
together with the present value of future gross premiums, associated with our long-term care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies; therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current
expectations. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded $139 million of additional benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of $170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance
recoverable of $31 million included in other long-term assets. In addition, future policy benefits payable include amounts of $224 million at December 31, 2011 and $229 million at December 31, 2010 which are subject to 100% coinsurance
agreements as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other
long-term assets.  Revenue Recognition  We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew
annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. 
Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also
establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. 
  73 


Table of Contents
Premiums revenue and administrative services only, or ASO, fees are estimated by multiplying
the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employers enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay, and beginning January 1, 2011,
for estimated rebates to policyholders under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. Enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government, also known as
retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on available data and historical trends. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as
prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current periods revenue.  We
bill and collect premium remittances from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates
and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable, based on the submission of
diagnosis data to CMS, and the collectibility is reasonably assured.  Medicare Part D Provisions 
We cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly
from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premiums revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract.
Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, receipts for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as receipts for certain discounts on brand name prescription drugs in the
coverage gap represent payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk.  The risk corridor provisions
compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional
payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual
contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or
long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of expected settlement.  The estimate of the settlement
associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain at period end, including member eligibility and risk adjustment score differences with CMS as well as pharmacy rebates from manufacturers. These factors
have an offsetting effect on changes in the risk corridor estimate. In 2011, we paid $380 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2010 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $388 million at
December 31, 2010. In 2010, we paid $180 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2009 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $145 million at December 31, 2009. The net liability associated
with the 2011 risk corridor estimate, which will be settled in 2012, was $329 million at December 31, 2011.  Reinsurance
and low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the
members out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for
low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMSs prospective subsidies against
actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. Beginning in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates 
  74 


Table of Contents

consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These discounts are funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer
the application of these funds. We account for these subsidies and discounts as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not recognize premiums revenue or benefit
expenses for these subsidies or discounts. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the
contract balance at the end of the reporting period. Gross financing receipts were $2.5 billion and gross financing withdrawals were $2.9 billion during 2011. CMS subsidy and brand name prescription drug discount activity recorded to the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2011 was $363 million to other current assets and $139 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses.  In order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage, CMS provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance
subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage, or coverage beyond CMSs defined standard benefits. The demonstration payment option, available to plans through 2010, was an arrangement in which CMS agreed to pay a capitation amount to a plan for
assuming the governments portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage. The capitation amount represented a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer. We chose
the demonstration payment option for some of our plans that offered enhanced coverage for plan years through 2010. This capitation amount, derived from our annual bid submissions, was recorded as premiums revenue. The variance between the capitation
amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer was subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. 
Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the brand name prescription drug discounts and risk corridor
payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. We continue to revise our estimates with respect to the risk corridor provisions based on subsequent period pharmacy claims data. 
Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions  CMS utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher
costs. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The
CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to Medicare Advantage plans. Rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our
payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the governments original Medicare program. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate
diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. We
estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on the submission of diagnosis data to CMS. The risk-adjustment model is more fully described in Item 1.  Business under the section titled Individual Medicare. 
Military services  In 2011, revenues derived from our military services business represented approximately 10% of consolidated premiums and services revenue. Military services premiums and services revenue primarily is
derived from our TRICARE South Region contract with the Department of Defense. The current TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities. We allocate the consideration to the various components of the contract
based on the relative fair value of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) health
care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn 
  75 


Table of Contents

reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) administrative services fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, and other services. We recognize the insurance premium
as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided. Administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are
performed.  The current TRICARE South Region contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial
portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target health care cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is
shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the
target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the
recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting
fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses. We continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our
reserves.  The military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform
services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change
orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Patient Services  Patient services revenue associated with the December 21, 2010 acquisition of Concentra includes (1) workers compensation injury care and related services and (2) other healthcare
services related to employer needs or statutory requirements. Patient services revenues are recognized in the period services are provided to the customer when the sales price is fixed or determinable, and are net of contractual allowances.
 The provider reimbursement methods for workers compensation injury care and related services vary on a state-by-state
basis. Most states have fee schedules pursuant to which all healthcare providers are uniformly reimbursed. The fee schedules are determined by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure.
In the states without fee schedules, healthcare providers are reimbursed based on usual, customary, and reasonable fees charged in the particular state in which the services are provided. We include billings for services in revenue net of allowance
for estimated differences between list prices and allowable fee schedule rates or amounts allowed as usual, customary and reasonable, as applicable.  Revenue for other healthcare services is recognized on a fee-for-service basis at estimated collectible amounts at the time services are rendered. Our fees are determined in advance for each type of
service performed.

 Approximately 95% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit
rating of AA- by S&P at December 31, 2011. Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated BB, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer
and requires diversification among various asset types.  Tax-exempt municipal securities included pre-refunded bonds of $332
million at December 31, 2011 and $344 million at December 31, 2010. These pre-refunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity. The ratings of
these pre-refunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established. Tax-exempt municipal securities that were not pre-refunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of U.S. states and
local municipalities and special revenue bonds. General obligation bonds, which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer, accounted for $1.1 billion of these municipals in the portfolio. Special revenue bonds, issued by
a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, and education, and supported by the revenues of that project, accounted for $1.4 billion of these municipals. Our general obligation bonds
are diversified across the U.S. with no individual state exceeding 11%. In addition, certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for
bond issues related to our tax-exempt municipal securities. We have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers. We owned $634 million and $597 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of tax-exempt securities guaranteed by
monoline insurers. The equivalent weighted average S&P credit rating of these tax-exempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was AA.  Our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities backed by home equity loans. The fair value of securities
backed by Alt-A and subprime loans was $3 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. There are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio. 
The percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 19.3% at December 31, 2011 and 29.4% at
December 31, 2010.

 Under the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss
in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of
our amortized cost basis. However, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the
amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income.  When we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit
rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic
data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. A decline in fair value is considered
other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the
expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment
include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a
decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general
economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional
material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  The recoverability
of our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities is supported by factors such as seniority, underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements. Our residential and commercial

  78 


Table of Contents

mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2011 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support, with 99% of the collateral consisting of prime loans. The weighted
average credit rating of all commercial mortgage-backed securities was AA at December 31, 2011.  Several European
countries, including Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece, have been subject to credit deterioration due to weakness in their economic and fiscal situations. We have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of these five countries.
 All issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2011 remain current on all
contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets
than when the securities were purchased. At December 31, 2011, we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these
securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011. 
There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2011, 2010, or 2009. 
Goodwill and Long-lived Assets  At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 51% of total stockholders equity, compared to 23% and 55%, respectively, at December 31,
2010.  We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and
more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our
reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an
operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. The realignment of our business segments and corresponding
change in our reportable segments, more fully described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units.
Accordingly, we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units as of January 1, 2011 using the relative fair value approach based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows as discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A significant portion of our historical goodwill was supported by future cash flows associated with our mail-order pharmacy and behavioral health businesses now grouped with our
Health & Well-Being Services businesses. This, in addition with the Concentra acquisition on December 21, 2010, resulted in the allocation of a substantial portion of our goodwill to the Health & Well-Being Services segment.
We completed an interim impairment test as of January 1, 2011 based on the new reporting units which did not result in an impairment loss.  We use a two-step process to review goodwill for impairment. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range
business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted
cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based
weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields,
medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and

annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the ultimate outcome of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation the estimates underlying our goodwill
impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a
substantial margin. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill. 
Beginning in 2012, we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step
quantitative goodwill impairment test. Refer to Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized
over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing
recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we
assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets.
There were no material impairment losses in the last three years.   


ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk, including those resulting from changes in interest rates. 
The level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income
and interest expense. Prior to 2009, under interest rate swap agreements, we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR using interest rate swap agreements. We terminated all of our
interest rate swap agreements in 2008, fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 6.08%. We may re-enter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. Amounts borrowed under the
revolving credit portion of our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread. There were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at December 31, 2011
or December 31, 2010.  Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial
position due to our significant investment portfolio, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality with a weighted average S&P credit rating of AA- at December 31, 2011. Our net unrealized position improved
$328 million from a net unrealized gain position of $197 million at December 31, 2010 to a net unrealized gain position of $525 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, we had gross unrealized losses of $17 million on our
investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased, and as such, there were no material other-than-temporary impairments during
2011. While we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities, given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that future declines
in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.  Duration is the time-weighted average of the present value of the bond portfolios cash flow. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates,
providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of

  80 


Table of Contents

our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 3.9 years as of December 31, 2011 and 4.0 years as of December 31, 2010. Based on the duration including
cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $420 million.  We have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200, and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period,
as reflected in the following table. The evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our investment portfolio consists of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. The
modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month period. This
evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income, including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio, changes in the asset allocation,
including shifts between taxable and tax-exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, changes in 3 month LIBOR rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once, have not changed
between 200 and 300 basis points, have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times, and have changed by less than 100 basis points five times.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. REPORTING ENTITY 
Nature of Operations  Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to
lifelong well-being. References throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements to we, us, our, Company, and Humana, mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. We derived
approximately 76% of our premiums and services revenue from contracts with the federal government in 2011. Under our federal government contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provide health insurance coverage for
Medicare Advantage members in Florida, accounting for approximately 16% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue in 2011. CMS is the federal governments agency responsible for administering the Medicare program. Under federal
government contracts with the Department of Defense we primarily provide health insurance coverage to TRICARE members, accounting for approximately 10% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue in 2011. 
Health Insurance Reform  In March 2010, the President signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health
Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. There are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of
regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business, which we expect to occur over the next several years.  Certain significant provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to
Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, an annual insurance industry premium-based assessment, and a three-year commercial reinsurance fee. Implementation
dates of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation vary from September 30, 2010 to as late as 2018. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation  Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Humana Inc. and subsidiaries that the Company controls including variable interest entities associated with medical practices for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we do not own medical practices but instead enter
into exclusive long-term management agreements with the affiliated Professional Associations, or P.A.s, that operate the medical practices. Based upon the provisions of these agreements, these affiliated P.A.s are variable interest entities and we
are the primary beneficiary, and accordingly we consolidated the affiliated P.A.s. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The areas involving the most significant use of estimates are the estimation of benefits payable, the impact of risk sharing provisions related to our Medicare and TRICARE
contracts, the valuation and related impairment recognition of investment securities, and the valuation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

and related impairment recognition of long-lived assets, including goodwill. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual
results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates.  Beginning with the filing of this Form 10-K for year ended
December 31, 2011, we adopted new guidance requiring the presentation of other comprehensive income in a statement presented with equal prominence to the other primary financial statements. As a result, we present net income, other
comprehensive income, and total comprehensive income in a single continuous statement referred to as the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our results of operations, including diluted
earnings per share common share, financial condition or cash flows. See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements within this note.  Realignment of Business Segments  During the first quarter of 2011,
we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. We currently manage and report our operating results using the following segments: Retail, Employer Group, and Health and Well-Being Services. We also disclose results for
Other Businesses. All respective amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively adjusted throughout the financial statements. Our segment information is more fully described in Note 16. 
As a result of changing our reportable segments, we also changed the classification of certain revenues and costs in our consolidated
statements of comprehensive income. Beginning January 1, 2011, costs of certain health and well-being services were reclassified as benefits expense including costs incurred by our wholly-owned mail order pharmacy from transactions with our
members that were historically classified as selling, general and administrative (and now titled operating costs), as well as depreciation and amortization expenses. The effect of this reclassification is to account for the cost of providing these
benefits to our members similarly whether the services are provided via a third party provider or internally through a stand-alone subsidiary. Likewise, co-share amounts from our members associated with our wholly-owned mail order pharmacy
operations, historically classified as other revenue, are now classified as a reduction of benefits expense. The remaining items previously classified as other revenue, primarily consisting of patient service revenue associated with our Concentra
Inc. subsidiary, which was acquired in December 2010, were combined with our previous administrative services fee revenue and are now classified as services revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation.
These adjustments had no impact on net income, cash flows or equity. Further, none of these adjustments impacted our regulated subsidiaries.  After giving effect to this reclassification, consolidated benefit expenses include depreciation and amortization expenses primarily from the delivery of pharmacy services by our wholly-owned pharmacy
business included in our Health and Well-Being Services segment. The amount of this expense was $33 million in 2011, $18 million in 2010, and $13 million in 2009.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash,
time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other money market instruments, and certain U.S. Government securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of
the investments.  Investment Securities  Investment securities, which consist entirely of debt securities, have been categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Investment securities available for current
operations are classified as 
  87 


Table of Contents
Humana Inc. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

current assets. Investment securities available for our long-term insurance products and professional liability funding requirements, as well as restricted statutory deposits and venture capital
investments, are classified as long-term assets. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, which are included as a component of investment income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the cost of investment
securities sold is based upon specific identification. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or
other-than-temporary impairment.  Under the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an
impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security
before recovery of our amortized cost basis. However, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a
credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. 
When we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairment is considered using a
variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a
security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we
take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit
enhancements. A decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference
between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. 
We participated in a securities lending program to optimize investment income. The program was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2011.
We loaned certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. The fair value of the loaned investment securities was monitored on
a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair value of the loaned investment securities fluctuated. The collateral, which may have been in the form of cash or U.S. Government securities, was deposited by the borrower
with an independent lending agent. Any cash collateral was recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, along with a liability to reflect our obligation to return the collateral included with trade accounts payable and
accrued expenses. The cash collateral was invested by the lending agent according to our investment guidelines, primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term corporate and asset-backed securities, and accounted for
consistent with our investment securities. Collateral received in the form of securities was not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets because, absent default by the borrower, we did not have the right to sell, pledge or otherwise reinvest
securities collateral. Loaned securities continued to be carried as investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets. Earnings on the invested cash collateral, net of expense, associated with the securities lending payable were recorded as
investment income.  Receivables and Revenue Recognition 
We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on
30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. 
  88 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.
 Premiums Revenue  We bill and collect premium remittances from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states
according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts
become determinable, based on the submission of diagnosis data to CMS, and the collectibility is reasonably assured.  Premiums
revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and beginning January 1, 2011, adjustments to recognize rebates to
policyholders under the minimum benefit ratios required under Health Insurance Reform Legislation. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We
routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current
operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.  Medicare Part D
 We cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we
receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premiums revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our
annual contract. Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, receipts for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as receipts for certain discounts on brand name
prescription drugs in the coverage gap represent payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk.  The risk
corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS
making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to
date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the
amount as current or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of expected settlement.  Reinsurance and
low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the
members out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for
low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMSs prospective subsidies against
actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. Beginning in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These
discounts are funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer the application of 
  89

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

these funds. We account for these subsidies and discounts as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not
recognize premiums revenue or benefit expenses for these subsidies or discounts. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and
accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period.  For plans where we provide enhanced
benefits and selected the alternative demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy, we receive a monthly per member capitation amount from CMS determined from our annual bid submissions. The capitation amount we receive from CMS
for assuming the governments portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage is recorded as premiums revenue. The variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to
risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. The demonstration provision terminated at the end of 2010. See Note 6 for detail regarding amounts recorded to the consolidated balance sheets related to the risk corridor settlement and
subsidies from CMS.  Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the brand name prescription drug
discounts and risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. We continue to revise our estimates with respect to the risk corridor provisions based on subsequent period pharmacy
claims data.  Military services  Military services premiums and services revenue primarily is derived from our TRICARE South Region contract with the Department of Defense, or DoD. We allocate the consideration to the various components
of the contract based on the relative fair value of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries;
(2) health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) administrative services fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, and other services. We recognize the
insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided. Administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period
services are performed. Our TRICARE South Region contract contains provisions to share the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits with the federal government. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance
of actual health care costs versus a negotiated target cost. We defer the recognition of any contingent revenues for favorable variances until the end of the contract period when the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably
assured. We estimate and recognize contingent benefit expense for unfavorable variances currently in our results of operations. We continually review the contingent benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns
relative to our negotiated target cost and make necessary adjustments to our reserves.  Revenues also may include change
orders attributable to our military services contracts. Change orders represent equitable adjustments for services not originally specified in the contracts. Revenues for these adjustments are recognized when a settlement amount becomes determinable
and the collectibility is reasonably assured. 
  90

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 
Services Revenue  Patient services revenue  Patient services include workers
compensation injury care and related services as well as other healthcare services related to employer needs or statutory requirements. Patient services revenues are recognized in the period services are provided to the customer when the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and are net of contractual allowances.  Administrative services fees 
Administrative services fees cover the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and
responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded groups. Revenues from providing administration services, also known as administrative services only, or ASO, are recognized in the period services are performed and are net of
estimated uncollectible amounts. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, many ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover
catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. Accordingly, we have recorded premiums revenue and benefit expenses related to these stop loss insurance contracts. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of
receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. ASO fees received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. 
Receivables  Receivables, including premium receivables, patient services revenue receivables, and ASO fee receivables, are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, retroactive membership
adjustments, and contractual allowances.  Policy Acquisition Costs 
Policy acquisition costs are those costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal business. Such costs
include commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and other costs we incur to acquire new business or renew existing business. We expense policy acquisition costs related to our employer-group prepaid health services policies as
incurred. These short-duration employer-group prepaid health services policies typically have a one-year term and may be cancelled upon 30 days notice by the employer group.  Life insurance, annuities, health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals are accounted for as long-duration insurance products because they are expected to remain in force for an extended
period beyond one year due to contractual and regulatory requirements. As a result, we defer policy acquisition costs, primarily consisting of commissions, and amortize them over the estimated life of the policies in proportion to premiums
earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income. See Note 17. 
Long-Lived Assets  Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Gains and losses on sales or disposals of property and equipment are included in operating costs. Certain costs related to the development or purchase of
internal-use software are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives 
  91 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

ranging from 3 to 10 years for equipment, 3 to 7 years for computer software, and 20 to 40 years for buildings. Improvements to leased facilities are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining
lease term or the anticipated life of the improvement.  We periodically review long-lived assets, including property and
equipment and other intangible assets, for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Losses are recognized for a long-lived asset to be held and used in our
operations when the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying value. We recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
A long-lived asset held for sale is reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation expense is not recognized on assets held for sale. Losses are recognized for a long-lived asset to be abandoned when
the asset ceases to be used. In addition, we periodically review the estimated lives of all long-lived assets for reasonableness.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the
unamortized excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if
adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A
component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting
unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. As discussed previously under Realignment of Business Segments within this Note 2, during
the first quarter of 2011, we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. As a result, we reassigned goodwill to our new reporting units as of January 1, 2011 using the relative fair value approach based on an
evaluation of future discounted cash flows as discussed in Note 8.  We use a two-step process to review goodwill for
impairment. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment tests are performed, at a minimum, in the fourth quarter of each year supported by our long-range business
plan and annual planning process. We rely on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows to determine fair value of our reporting units. Impairment tests completed for 2011, including an interim test completed January 1 in connection with the
segment realignment, 2010 and 2009 did not result in an impairment loss. Beginning in 2012, we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. See
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements within this note.  Other intangible assets primarily relate to acquired
customer contracts/relationships and are included with other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Other intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset. This
sometimes results in an accelerated method of amortization for customer contracts because the asset tends to dissipate at a more rapid rate in earlier periods. Other than customer contracts, other intangible assets generally are amortized using the
straight-line method. We review other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment under our long-lived asset policy. 
Benefits Payable and Benefit Expense Recognition  Benefit expenses include claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance
coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care and other supplemental benefits 
  92 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

provided prior to the balance sheet date. Capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical
care to members. Pharmacy costs represent payments for members prescription drug benefits, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. Receivables for such pharmacy rebates are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Other supplemental benefits include dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products.  We
estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other
relevant factors, and record benefit reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves.
 We reassess the profitability of our contracts for providing insurance coverage to our members when current operating results
or forecasts indicate probable future losses. We establish a premium deficiency liability in current operations to the extent that the sum of expected future costs, claim adjustment expenses, and maintenance costs exceeds related future premiums
under contracts without consideration of investment income. For purposes of determining premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of such contracts.
Losses recognized as a premium deficiency result in a beneficial effect in subsequent periods as operating losses under these contracts are charged to the liability previously established. Because the majority of our member contracts renew annually,
we do not anticipate recording a material premium deficiency liability, except when unanticipated adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate otherwise.  We believe our benefits payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required. However, such estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events. Therefore, the actual
liability could differ materially from the amounts provided.  Future policy benefits payable 
Future policy benefits payable include liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including life insurance, annuities, health, and
long-term care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on
interest, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. Changes in estimates of these reserves are recognized as an adjustment to benefit expenses in the
period the changes occur.  Book Overdraft 
Under our cash management system, checks issued but not yet presented to banks frequently result in overdraft balances for accounting
purposes and are classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in book overdrafts from period to period are reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. 
Income Taxes  We recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. These

temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. We also recognize the future
tax benefits such as net operating and capital loss carryforwards as deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided against these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. Future years tax expense may be increased or decreased by adjustments to the valuation allowance or to the estimated accrual for income taxes.  We record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax return position taken with respect to a particular transaction will be sustained. A liability, if recorded, is not considered resolved
until the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, or the tax position is ultimately settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation. We classify interest and penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes.  Derivative Financial Instruments
 At times, we may use interest-rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. The differential
between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as adjustments to interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We were not party to any interest-rate swap
agreements in 2011, 2010, or 2009. Prior to 2009, we were parties to interest-rate swap agreements that converted the fixed interest rates on our senior notes to a variable rate and were accounted for as fair value hedges. 
Stock-Based Compensation  We generally recognize stock-based compensation expense, as determined on the date of grant at fair value, on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service
in exchange for the award (the vesting period). However, for awards granted to retirement eligible employees, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the requisite service period or the period from the
date of grant to an employees eligible retirement date. We estimate expected forfeitures and recognize compensation expense only for those awards which are expected to vest. We estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In addition, we report certain tax effects of stock-based compensation as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Additional detail regarding our
stock-based compensation plans is included in Note 12.  Earnings Per Common Share 
We compute basic earnings per common share on the basis of the weighted-average number of unrestricted common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of unrestricted common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding employee stock options and restricted shares, or units, using the treasury stock
method.  Fair Value  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized into a fair value hierarchy based on whether the inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect
market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use. The fair value hierarchy includes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value
as described below.  Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
liabilities include debt securities that are traded in an active exchange market. 
  94 


Table of Contents
Humana Inc. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 
Level 2  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices in
active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments as well as debt securities whose value is determined using a pricing
model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 includes assets and liabilities whose
value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use as well as those requiring significant management judgment.
 Fair value of actively traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices. Fair value of other debt securities are
based on quoted market prices of identical or similar securities or based on observable inputs like interest rates generally using a market valuation approach, or, less frequently, an income valuation approach and are generally classified as Level
2. We obtain a quoted price for each security from a third party pricing service. These prices are generally derived from recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, including adjustments through the reporting date based upon
observable market information. When quoted prices are not available, the third party pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable securities or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the
markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include benchmark yields, reported trades, credit spreads, broker quotes, default rates, and prepayment speeds. We are responsible for the determination of
fair value and as such we perform analysis on the prices received from the third party pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of monthly price fluctuations as well as a
quarterly comparison of the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by our third party investment advisor. In addition, on a quarterly basis we examine the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities
across asset classes, credit rating levels, and various durations.  Fair value of privately held debt securities, including
venture capital investments as well as auction rate securities, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches, where an observable quoted market does not exist and are generally classified as
Level 3. For privately-held debt securities, such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business, and reviewing the
underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Auction rate securities are debt instruments with interest rates that reset through periodic short-term auctions. From time to time, liquidity issues in the credit markets
have led to failed auctions. Given the liquidity issues, fair value could not be estimated based on observable market prices, and as such, unobservable inputs were used. For auction rate securities, valuation methodologies include consideration of
the quality of the sector and issuer, underlying collateral, underlying final maturity dates, and liquidity.  Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new
guidance that will allow entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Previous guidance required an entity to test goodwill for impairment, on at
least an annual basis, by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the

  95 


Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

jamount of the impairment loss, if any. Under the new guidance, we would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on the qualitative assessment,
that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The new guidance includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. The new guidance is effective,
for us, beginning with annual and interim impairment tests performed in 2012. As the new guidance only affects the manner of assessment of goodwill for impairment, it will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition,
or cash flows.  In July 2011, the FASB issued new guidance regarding how health insurers should recognize and classify fees
mandated by the Health Insurance Reform Legislation. The Health Insurance Reform Legislation imposes a non-deductible annual fee on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The guidance requires that the
liability for the fee be estimated and recorded in full once qualifying insurance coverage is provided in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense over the calendar year
that it is payable. The new guidance is effective for us when the fee is initially imposed in calendar year 2014.  In June
2011, the FASB issued new guidance requiring the presentation of other comprehensive income in a statement presented with equal prominence to the other primary financial statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other
comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity and requires one of two alternatives for the presentation of items of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single continuous statement referred
to as the statement of comprehensive income, or (2) in two separate, but consecutive statements. Under either alternative, each component of net income and each component of other comprehensive income, together with totals for each, as well as
total comprehensive income would need to be displayed. The new guidance is effective for us, beginning with the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three months ending March 31, 2012, with retrospective application required. As permitted, we early
adopted the new guidance with the filing of this Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2011, electing to present net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income. As the new guidance only
affects the presentation of other comprehensive income, it did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and those prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards. While the new guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles, it expands existing
disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments which could change how existing fair value measurement guidance is applied. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning with the filing of our Form 10-Q for the
three months ending March 31, 2012. The adoption of the new guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
3. ACQUISITIONS 
Effective December 30, 2011, we acquired the California-based Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization
(HMO) MD Care, Inc., or MD Care. This acquisition expanded our Medicare footprint in California and grew our Medicare enrollment.  On December 6, 2011, we acquired Anvita, Inc., or Anvita, a San Diego-based health care analytics company. The Anvita acquisition provides scalable analytics solutions that produce clinical insights
which we expect to enhance our ability to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care for our members and

customers. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in goodwill of $117 million and other intangible assets of $60 million. The goodwill was assigned to the Retail segment and is
not deductible for tax purposes. The other intangible assets, which primarily consist of technology and customer contracts, have a weighted average useful life of 6.5 years. The purchase price allocation is preliminary, subject to completion of
valuation analyses, including, for example, refining assumptions used to calculate the fair value of other intangible assets. 
On December 21, 2010, we acquired Concentra Inc., or Concentra, a health care company based in Addison, Texas, for $805 million.
During 2011, we accrued and paid $6 million related to the final determination of working capital that existed at the acquisition date and recorded immaterial adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of Concentras net tangible assets
acquired with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Through its affiliated clinicians, Concentra delivers occupational medicine, urgent care, physical therapy, and wellness services to workers and the general public through its operation of
medical centers and worksite medical facilities. The Concentra acquisition provides us entry into the primary care space on a national scale, offering additional means for achieving health and wellness solutions and providing an expandable platform
for growth with a management team experienced in physician asset management and alternate site care. The total consideration of $811 million exceeded our estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by approximately $725 million, of
which we allocated $188 million to other intangible assets and $537 million to goodwill. The goodwill was assigned to the Health and Well-Being Services segment. The other intangible assets, which primarily consist of customer relationships and
trade name, have a weighted average useful life of 13.7 years. Approximately $58 million of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.  The results of operations and financial condition of MD Care, Anvita, and Concentra have been included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated balance sheets from the
acquisition dates. Acquisition-related costs recognized in connection with these acquisitions were not material. The pro forma financial information assuming the acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2010 was not material to our results of
operations.  During the second half of 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire Arcadian Management
Services, Inc., or Arcadian, a Medicare Advantage HMO, and SeniorBridge, a chronic-care provider providing in-home care for seniors. Arcadian serves Medicare Advantage HMO members in 15 U.S. states, offering us an opportunity to expand our Medicare
footprint and grow our Medicare enrollment. SeniorBridge will expand our existing clinical and home health capabilities and strengthen our offerings for members with complex chronic-care needs. The closings of these acquisitions are subject to
federal and/or state regulatory approvals.

 We participated in a securities lending program where we loaned certain investment securities for short
periods of time in exchange for collateral, consisting of cash or U.S. Government securities, initially equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. We terminated the securities lending program in the fourth quarter
of 2011. Investment securities with a fair value of $54 million at December 31, 2010 were on loan.

 Approximately 95% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit
rating of AA- by S&P at December 31, 2011. Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated BB, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. At December 31, 2011, 12% of our tax-exempt municipal
securities were pre-refunded, generally with U.S. government and agency securities. Tax-exempt municipal securities that were not pre-refunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of U.S. states and local municipalities as well as special
revenue bonds. General obligation bonds, which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer, accounted for 45% of the tax-exempt municipals that were not pre-refunded in the portfolio. Special revenue bonds, issued by a
municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, and education, and supported by the revenues of that project, accounted for the remaining 55% of these municipals. Our general obligation
bonds are diversified across the U.S. with no individual state exceeding 11%. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. In addition, 22% of our tax-exempt securities were
insured by bond insurers and had an equivalent weighted average S&P credit rating of AA exclusive of the bond insurers guarantee.

The recoverability of our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities is
supported by factors such as seniority, underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements. Our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2011 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit
support, with 99% of the collateral consisting of prime loans. The weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgage-backed securities was AA at December 31, 2011. 
The percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 19.3% at December 31, 2011 and 29.4% at
December 31, 2010.  Several European countries, including Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece, have been subject to
credit deterioration due to weakness in their economic and fiscal situations. We have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of these five countries.  All issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2011 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously
described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. At December 31, 2011, we did not intend
to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As a result, we believe that the
securities with an unrealized loss were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.  The detail of realized
gains (losses) related to investment securities and included within investment income was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009:

 Financial Liabilities 
Our long-term debt is recorded at carrying value in our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our long-term debt outstanding
was $1,659 million at December 31, 2011 and $1,669 million at December 31, 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt was $1,834 million at December 31, 2011 and $1,746 million at December 31, 2010. The fair value of our
long-term debt is determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or, if no quoted market prices are available, on the current prices estimated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

6. MEDICARE PART D

8. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
The realignment of our business segments and corresponding change in our reportable segments, more fully described in
Note 16, resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units, the unit of accounting for goodwill. Accordingly, we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units as of January 1, 2011 using the relative fair value approach based on an
evaluation of future discounted cash flows. A significant portion of our historical goodwill was supported by future cash flows associated with our mail-order pharmacy and behavioral health businesses now grouped with our Health & Well-Being
Services businesses. This, in addition with the Concentra acquisition on December 21, 2010, resulted in the allocation of a substantial portion of our goodwill to the Health & Well-Being Services segment as outlined in the table below. Changes
in the carrying amount of goodwill for our new reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (retrospectively adjusted) were as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 
Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse
experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. The amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our Medicare products, coupled with the
application of consistent reserving practices. During 2011 and 2010, we experienced prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of approximately $205 million and $231 million, respectively. This favorable reserve
development primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and, to a lesser extent, better than originally estimated utilization. In addition, in 2010, a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim
submissions was a contributing factor. The improvements in the claims processing environment benefited all lines of business during 2011, but were most prominent in our Medicare PFFS line of business in 2010. As a result of these improvements, we
experienced a significant increase in claim overpayment recoveries during 2011 for claims with 2010 and 2009 dates of service and during 2010 for claims with 2009 and 2008 dates of service, primarily as a result of increased audits of provider
billings, as well as system enhancements that improved the claim recovery functionality. This increase resulted in our historical completion factors being understated for those periods since they had been developed using our previous historical
experience. The remaining reserve redundancy primarily resulted from our consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as described above. 
Military services benefits payable of $339 million and $255 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily consisted
of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government, as more fully described in Note 2. This amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal
government.  Benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded
from the previous table were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

 The provision for income taxes for 2011 and 2010 reflects an $11 million and $13 million, respectively,
estimated impact from limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $500,000 per employee as mandated by the Health Insurance Reform Legislation.  The liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $17 million at December 31, 2008. This liability, which was released in 2009 as a result of settlements associated with the completion of the audit of
our U.S. income tax returns for 2005 and 2006, reduced tax expense $17 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2011, we do not have material uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.

 At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $494 million of net operating losses to carry forward
related to prior acquisitions. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to offset future taxable income, will expire from 2012 through 2031. A significant portion of these losses are in a subsidiary that will not be included in the Humana
Inc. consolidated tax return until 2013, and, therefore, may not be used until that point. Due to limitations and uncertainty regarding our ability to use some of the carryforwards, a valuation allowance was established on $77 million of net
operating loss carryforwards related to prior acquisitions. For the remainder of the net operating loss carryforwards, based on our historical record of producing taxable income and profitability, we have concluded that future operating income will
be sufficient to give rise to tax expense to recover all deferred tax assets.  We file income tax returns in the United States
and certain foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, has completed its examinations of our consolidated income tax returns for 2010 and prior years. Our 2011 tax returns are under advance review by the IRS under its
Compliance Assurance Process, or CAP. With few exceptions, which are immaterial in the aggregate, we no longer are subject to state, local and foreign tax examinations for years before 2008. As of December 31, 2011, we are not aware of any
material adjustments that may be proposed.

 Senior Notes  Our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes
are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances.
 Prior to 2009, we were parties to interest-rate swap agreements that exchanged the fixed interest rate under our senior notes
for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. As a result, the carrying value of the senior notes was adjusted to reflect changes in value caused by an increase or decrease in interest rates. During 2008, we terminated all of our swap agreements. The
cumulative adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes was $103 million as of the termination date which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes, resulting in a weighted-average
effective interest rate fixed at 6.08%. The unamortized carrying value adjustment was $74 million as of December 31, 2011 and $84 million as of December 31, 2010.  Credit Agreement  In November 2011, we amended and restated our
3-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which was set to expire in December 2013 and replaced it with a 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving agreement expiring November 2016. Under the new credit agreement, at our option, we can
borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either LIBOR plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread. The LIBOR spread, currently 120 basis points, varies depending on our
credit ratings ranging from 87.5 to 147.5 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 17.5 basis points, may fluctuate between 12.5 and 27.5 basis points, depending upon our credit
ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option. 
The terms of the new credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material
adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the new credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary

events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0:1. We
are in compliance with the financial covenants, with actual net worth of $8.1 billion and actual leverage ratio of 0.6:1, as measured in accordance with the new credit agreement as of December 31, 2011. In addition, the new credit
agreement includes an uncommitted $250 million incremental loan facility.  At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings
outstanding under the new credit agreement. We have outstanding letters of credit of $14 million secured under the new credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2011, we had $986
million of remaining borrowing capacity under the new credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking,
with some parties to the credit agreement.  Other Long-Term Borrowings 
Other long-term borrowings of $36 million at December 31, 2011 represent junior subordinated debt. The junior subordinated debt,
which is due in 2037, may be called by us without penalty in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. 
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Employee Savings Plan  We have defined contribution retirement savings plans covering eligible employees. Prior to 2011, our contribution to these plans included contributions to our employees retirement accounts based on
a percentage of compensation as well as matching contributions based on the amount of our employees contributions to the plans. Beginning in 2011, we ceased making retirement account contributions and increased our matching contributions. The
cost of these plans amounted to approximately $126 million in 2011, $113 million in 2010, and $109 million in 2009, all of which was funded currently to the extent it was deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Companys cash match is
invested pursuant to the participants contribution direction. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $87.61 on December 30, 2011, approximately 17% of the retirement and savings plans assets were invested in our common
stock, or approximately 3.7 million shares, representing 2% of the shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, approximately 6.1 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our
defined contribution retirement savings plans.  Stock-Based Compensation 
We have plans under which options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock awards, including restricted stock units, have been
granted to executive officers, directors and key employees. The terms and vesting schedules for stock-based awards vary by type of grant. Generally, the awards vest upon time-based conditions. The stock awards of retirement-eligible participants
will continue to vest upon retirement from the Company. Our equity award program includes a retirement provision that treats all employees with a combination of age and years of service with the Company totaling 65 or greater, with a minimum
required age of 55 and a minimum requirement of 5 years of service, as retirement-eligible. Upon exercise, stock-based compensation awards are settled with authorized but unissued company stock or treasury stock. The

 The tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is based on the amount of
compensation expense recorded for book purposes. The actual tax benefit realized in our tax return is based on the intrinsic value, or the excess of the market value over the exercise or purchase price, of stock options exercised and restricted
stock awards vested during the period. The actual tax benefit realized for the deductions taken on our tax returns from option exercises and restricted stock award vesting totaled $44 million in 2011, $15 million in 2010, and $16 million in 2009.
There was no capitalized stock-based compensation expense during these years.  At December 31, 2011, there were
27.8 million shares reserved for stock award plans, including 19.5 million shares of common stock available for future grants assuming all stock options or 8.7 million shares available for future grants assuming all restricted stock
awards.  Stock Options  Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our stock plans, as approved by the Board of Directors and
stockholders, define fair market value as the average of the highest and lowest composite stock prices reported by the New York Stock Exchange on a given date. Exercise provisions vary, but most options vest in whole or in part 1 to 3 years after
grant and expire 7 to 10 years after grant.  The weighted-average fair value of each option granted during 2011, 2010, and
2009 is provided below. The fair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the weighted-average assumptions indicated below:

As discussed in Note 14, in April 2011, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy. 
When valuing employee stock options, we stratify the employee population into three homogenous groups that historically have exhibited
similar exercise behaviors. These groups are executive officers, directors, and all other employees. We value the stock options based on the unique assumptions for each of these employee groups.

We calculate the expected term for our employee stock options based on historical
employee exercise behavior and base the risk-free interest rate on a traded zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term substantially equal to the options expected term.  The volatility used to value employee stock options is based on historical volatility. We calculate historical volatility using a simple-average calculation methodology based on daily price intervals as
measured over the expected term of the option.  Activity for our option plans was as follows for the year ended

 As of December 31, 2011, outstanding stock options, substantially all of which are expected to vest,
had an aggregate intrinsic value of $108 million, and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.7 years. As of December 31, 2011, exercisable stock options had an aggregate intrinsic value of $50 million, and a weighted-average
remaining contractual term of 2.5 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2011 was $88 million, compared with $11 million during 2010 and $24 million during 2009. Cash received from stock option exercises totaled $134
million in 2011, $17 million in 2010, and $18 million in 2009.  Total compensation expense not yet recognized related to
nonvested options was $13 million at December 31, 2011. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.1 years.  Restricted Stock Awards  Restricted stock awards are granted with a fair
value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant and generally vest three years from the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of our restricted stock awards was $67.70 in 2011, $49.29 in 2010, and $41.16
in 2009. Activity for our restricted stock awards was as follows for the year ended December 31, 2011:

The fair value of shares vested during the years ended was $36 million in 2011, $30
million in 2010, and $22 million in 2009. Total compensation expense not yet recognized related to nonvested restricted stock awards was $63 million at December 31, 2011. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over a weighted-average
period of approximately 2.0 years. There are no other contractual terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.

 Stock Repurchases  In April 2011, the Board of Directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to $250 million with a new authorization for repurchases of up to $1 billion of our common
shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. The new authorization will expire June 30, 2013. Under the new share repurchase authorization, shares could be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices

in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume, pricing, and timing. During 2011, we repurchased
0.8 million shares in open market transactions for $53 million at an average price of $63.73 under the previously approved share repurchase authorization and we repurchased 5.9 million shares in open market transactions for $439 million at
an average price of $74.01 under the new authorization. During 2010, we repurchased 1.99 million shares for $100 million under the old stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2009 at an average price of $50.17. No
shares were repurchased in open market transactions during 2009. As of February 6, 2012, the remaining authorized amount under the new authorization totaled $561 million.  In connection with employee stock plans, we acquired 0.8 million common shares for $49 million in 2011, 0.2 million common shares for $8 million in 2010, and 0.6 million common shares for
$23 million in 2009.  Regulatory Requirements 
Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our
parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is
limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 
Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum
requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which exceeded
aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. The amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately $970 million in the aggregate. This compares to dividends that
were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately $740 million. 
15. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
Leases  We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2025. We sublease facilities or
partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations. Rent with scheduled escalation terms are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent expense and sublease rental income, which are recorded net as
an operating cost, for all operating leases were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

 Purchase Obligations 
We have agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in
each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the
transaction. We have purchase obligation commitments of $117 million in 2012, $60 million in 2013, $35 million in 2014, $11 million in 2015, and $22 million thereafter. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31,
2011, we were not involved in any SPE transactions.  Guarantees and Indemnifications 
Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed
by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to
providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they
perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to
maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Government Contracts 
Our Medicare products, which accounted for approximately 65% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS
notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All
material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare products have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2012 have been approved. 
CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. The
risk-adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a
comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the governments original Medicare program. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit the
necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to
Medicare Advantage plans. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on
providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims.  CMS is continuing
to perform audits of various companies selected Medicare Advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data. These audits are referred to herein as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review
medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans. 
On December 21, 2010, CMS posted a description of the agencys proposed RADV sampling and payment adjustment calculation
methodology to its website, and invited public comment, noting that CMS may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received. We believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by CMS is
fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound. In essence, in making the comparison referred to above, CMS relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans: (1) fee for service (FFS) data from the
governments original Medicare program; and (2) MA data. The proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data (MA data), while not performing the same exercise on the other set (FFS data). However, because these
two sets of data are inextricably linked, we believe CMS must audit and validate both of them before determining the financial implications of any potential RADV audit results, in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate. We
believe that the Social Security Act, under which the payment model was established, requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining risk-adjusted payments to MA plans. Furthermore, our payment received from CMS, as well as benefits
offered and premiums charged to members, is based on bids that did not, by CMS design, include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. We believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after CMS acceptance of bids would
improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums.  CMS has received public comments, including our
comments and comments from other industry participants and the American Academy of Actuaries, which expressed concerns about the failure to 
  115



Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

appropriately compare the two sets of data. On February 3, 2011, CMS issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making
changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received, although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make.  To date, six Humana contracts have been selected by CMS for RADV audits for the 2007 contract year, consisting of one pilot audit and five targeted audits for Humana plans. We
believe that the proposed methodology for these audits is actuarially unsound and in violation of the Social Security Act. We intend to defend that position vigorously. However, if CMS moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology
without changes to adequately address the data inconsistency issues described above, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the Medicare Advantage program and, therefore, our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.  At December 31, 2011, our military services business, which accounted for approximately 10% of our total
premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract. The original 5-year South Region contract expired on March 31, 2009 and was extended through March 31, 2012.
On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the new TRICARE South Region contract to us, which we expect to take effect on April 1, 2012. The new 5-year South Region contract, which expires
March 31, 2017, is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year during its term at the governments option.  Under the current TRICARE South Region contract, any variance from the negotiated target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in
the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to
increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 3% of our
total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto Rico. Effective October 1, 2010, as amended in May 2011, the Puerto Rico Health
Insurance Administration, or PRHIA, awarded us three contracts for the East, Southeast, and Southwest regions for a three year term through June 30, 2013.  The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without
corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters  Provider
Litigation  Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. (Humana Military) was named as a defendant in Sacred
Heart Health System, Inc., et al. v. Humana Military Healthcare Services Inc., Case No. 3:07-cv-00062 MCR/EMT (the Sacred Heart Complaint), a purported class action lawsuit filed on February 5, 2007 in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Florida asserting contract and fraud claims against Humana Military. The Sacred Heart Complaint alleged, among other things, that, Humana Military breached its network agreements with a class of hospitals in six states,
including the seven named plaintiffs, that contracted for reimbursement of 
  116



Table of Contents
Humana Inc. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

outpatient services provided to beneficiaries of the DoDs TRICARE health benefits program (TRICARE). The Complaint alleged that Humana Military breached its network agreements
when it failed to reimburse the hospitals based on negotiated discounts for non-surgical outpatient services performed on or after October 1, 1999, and instead reimbursed them based on published CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charges (so-called
CMAC rates). Humana Military denied that it breached the network agreements with the hospitals and asserted a number of defenses to these claims. The Complaint sought, among other things, the following relief for the purported class
members: (i) damages as a result of the alleged breach of contract by Humana Military, (ii) taxable costs of the litigation, (iii) attorneys fees, and (iv) any other relief the court deems just and proper. Separate and apart from
the class relief, named plaintiff Sacred Heart Health System Inc. requested damages and other relief for its individual claim against Humana Military for fraud in the inducement to contract. On September 25, 2008, the district court certified a
class consisting of all institutional healthcare service providers in TRICARE former Regions 3 and 4 which had network agreements with Humana Military to provide outpatient non-surgical services to CHAMPUS/TRICARE beneficiaries as of
November 18, 1999, excluding those network providers who contractually agreed with Humana Military to submit any such disputes with Humana Military to arbitration. On March 3, 2010, the Court of Appeals reversed the district courts
class certification order and remanded the case to the district court for further proceeding. On June 28, 2010, the plaintiffs sought leave of the district court to amend their complaint to join additional hospital plaintiffs. Humana Military
filed its response to the motion on July 28, 2010. The district court granted the plaintiffs motion to join 33 additional hospitals on September 24, 2010. On October 27, 2010, the plaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint
claiming the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida has subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the allegations in the complaint raise a substantial question under federal law. The amended complaint asserts no other
material changes to the allegations or relief sought by the plaintiffs. Humana Militarys Answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint was filed on November 30, 2010. We are currently involved in discovery on this matter, with trial currently
scheduled for October 2012.  On March 2, 2009, in a case styled Southeast Georgia Regional Medical Center, et al. v.
Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc., the named plaintiffs filed an arbitration demand, seeking relief on the same grounds as the plaintiffs in the Sacred Heart litigation. The arbitration plaintiffs originally sought certification
of a class consisting of all institutional healthcare service providers that had contracts with Humana Military to provide outpatient non-surgical services and whose agreements provided for dispute resolution through arbitration. Humana Military
submitted its response to the demand for arbitration on May 1, 2009. The plaintiffs have subsequently withdrawn their motion for class certification. On June 18, 2010, plaintiffs submitted their amended arbitration complaint. Humana
Militarys answer to the complaint was submitted on July 9, 2010. An arbitration trial was held from September 26, 2011 to October 7, 2011. On January 20, 2012, the Arbitration Panel issued an Interim Award granting relief
in favor of the plaintiffs on their claims for breach of contract and in favor of Humana Military on its counterclaim for recoupment based upon improper coding and billing for services on the part of the plaintiffs. The Arbitration Panel reserved
decision on the award of damages pending submission of additional evidence and argument by the parties.  Florida Matters
 As previously disclosed, with the assistance of outside counsel, we are conducting an ongoing internal investigation
related to certain aspects of our Florida subsidiary operations. We have voluntarily self-reported the existence of this investigation to CMS, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Matters under
review include, without limitation, the relationships between certain of our Florida-based employees and providers in our Medicaid and/or Medicare networks, practices related to the financial support of non-profit or provider access centers for
Medicaid enrollment and related enrollment processes, and loans to or other financial support of physician practices. We have reported to these regulatory authorities on the progress of our investigation to date, and intend to continue to discuss
with these authorities 
  117

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

our factual findings as well as any remedial actions we have taken or may take. We also may face litigation or further government inquiry regarding certain aspects of the Medicare and Medicaid
operations of certain of our Florida subsidiaries.  On December 16, 2010, an individual filed a qui tam suit captioned
United States of America ex rel. Marc Osheroff v. Humana et al. in the Southern District of Florida, against us, several of our health plan subsidiaries, and certain other companies that operate medical centers in Miami-Dade County, Florida.
After the U.S. government declined to intervene, the Court ordered the complaint unsealed, and the individual plaintiff amended his complaint and served the Company on December 8, 2011. The Amended Complaint alleges certain civil violations by
our CAC Medical Centers in Florida, including offering various amenities such as transportation and meals, to Medicare and dual eligible individuals in our community center settings. The Amended Complaint seeks damages and penalties on behalf of the
United States under the Anti-Inducement and Anti-Kickback Statutes and the False Claims Act. We expect to file motions to dismiss on behalf of Humana and our subsidiaries.  On January 6, 2012, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida advised our legal counsel that it is seeking documents and information from us
and several of our affiliates relating to several matters including the coding of medical claims by one or more South Florida medical providers, and loans to physician practices. 
Other Lawsuits and Regulatory Matters  Our current and past business practices are subject to review or other investigations by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and other state and federal regulatory authorities.
These authorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance and benefits companies. These reviews focus on numerous facets of our business, including claims payment practices, provider contracting, competitive practices,
commission payments, privacy issues, utilization management practices, and sales practices, among others. Some of these reviews have historically resulted in fines imposed on us and some have required changes to some of our practices. We continue to
be subject to these reviews, which could result in additional fines or other sanctions being imposed on us or additional changes in some of our practices.  We also are involved in various other lawsuits that arise, for the most part, in the ordinary course of our business operations, certain of which may be styled as class-action lawsuits, including
employment litigation, claims of medical malpractice, bad faith, nonacceptance or termination of providers, anticompetitive practices, improper rate setting, failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements, general
contractual matters, intellectual property matters, and challenges to subrogation practices. As a government contractor, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that
the government contractor submitted false claims to the government. Litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation. If
the government does not intervene, the lawsuit is unsealed, and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own. We also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers, members, and
others, including failure to properly pay claims, improper policy terminations, challenges to our implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and other litigation. Under state guaranty assessment laws, we may be assessed (up to
prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business as we do.  Personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers, except
to the

extent that claimants seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted. In addition, insurance
coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.  We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the
possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors,
including: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there
are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties (including where it is uncertain how liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants); or (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. 
The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot
be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that any such penalties, fines or
other sanctions could be substantial, and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows and may affect our reputation. 
16. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
During the first quarter of 2011, we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. As a
result, we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect managements view of the business and to align our external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial
reporting model. All respective amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively adjusted throughout the financial statements as discussed in Note 2. Our new reportable segments and the basis for determining those segments are
discussed below.  We currently manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Employer Group, and Health and
Well-Being Services. In addition, we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles in an Other Businesses category. These segments
are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our
Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources.  The Retail segment consists of Medicare and commercial
fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, marketed directly to individuals. The Employer Group segment consists of Medicare and
commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups. The
Health and Well-Being Services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including primary care, pharmacy, integrated wellness, and home care services. The Other
Businesses category consists of our Military services, primarily our TRICARE South Region contract, Medicaid, and closed-block long-term care businesses as well as our contract with CMS to administer the LI-NET program. 
Our Health and Well-Being Services intersegment revenues primarily relate to managing prescription drug coverage for
members of our other segments through Humana Pharmacy Solutions®, or HPS, and includes the

  119



Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 

operations of RightSourceRx®, our mail order
pharmacy business. These revenues consist of the prescription price (ingredient cost plus dispensing fee), including the portion to be settled with the member (co-share) or with the government (subsidies), plus any associated administrative fees.
Services revenues related to the distribution of prescriptions by third party retail pharmacies in our networks are recognized when the claim is processed and product revenues from dispensing prescriptions from our mail order pharmacies are recorded
when the prescription or product is shipped. Our pharmacy operations, which are responsible for designing pharmacy benefits, including defining member co-share responsibilities, determining formulary listings, selecting and establishing prices
charged by retail pharmacies, confirming member eligibility, reviewing drug utilization, and processing claims, act as a principal in the arrangement on behalf of members in our other segments. As principal, our Health and Well-Being Services
segment reports revenues on a gross basis including co-share amounts from members collected by third party retail pharmacies at the point of service.  We present our consolidated results of operations from the perspective of the health plans. As a result, the cost of providing benefits to our members, whether provided via a third party provider or
internally through a stand-alone subsidiary, is classified as benefits expense and excludes the portion of the cost for which the health plans do not bear responsibility, including member co-share amounts and government subsidies of $4.2 billion,
$3.5 billion, and $3.5 billion for years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Other than those
described previously, the accounting policies of each segment are the same and are described in Note 2. Transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our Health and Well-Being Services segment, primarily pharmacy
and behavioral health services, to our Retail and Employer Group customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks, enabling
us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments.
Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items
are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations in the tables presenting segment results below.

17. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-DURATION INSURANCE PRODUCTS 
Premiums associated with our long-duration insurance products accounted for approximately 2% of our consolidated
premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. We use long-duration accounting for products such as long-term care, life insurance, annuities, and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals because
they are expected to remain in force for an extended period beyond one year and because premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result, we defer policy acquisition
costs, primarily consisting of commissions, and amortize them over the estimated life of the policies in proportion to premiums earned.  In addition, we establish reserves for future policy benefits in recognition of the fact that some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in
future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The
assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the
liability, together with the present value of future gross premiums, are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge
many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care policies. We monitor the
loss experience of these long-term care policies and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. To the extent premium rate increases
and/or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions, future adjustments to reserves could be required.  The
table below presents deferred acquisition costs and future policy benefits payable associated with our long-duration insurance products for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

 In addition, future policy benefits payable include amounts of $224 million at December 31,
2011 and $229 million at December 31, 2010 which are subject to 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 18.  Benefit expense associated with future policy benefits payable was $127 million in 2011, $306 million in 2010, and $73 million in 2009. Benefit expense for 2010 included a net charge of $139 million
associated with our long-term care policies discussed further below. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs included in operating costs was $34 million in 2011, $198 million in 2010, and $52 million in 2009. Amortization expense for 2010
included a write-down of deferred acquisition costs of $147 million discussed further below.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
 
Future policy benefits payable include $938 million at December 31, 2011 and
$825 million at December 31, 2010 associated with a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the November 30, 2007 acquisition of KMG . During the fourth quarter of 2010, certain states approved premium rate
increases for a large portion of our long-term care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions. Based on these actions by the states, combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition
date assumptions, we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable, together with the present value of future gross premiums, associated with our long-term care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under
these policies; therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded $139 million of additional benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in future
policy benefits payable of $170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of $31 million included in other long-term assets.  Deferred acquisition costs included $54 million and $36 million associated with our individual commercial medical policies at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Future policy
benefits payable associated with our individual commercial medical policies were $233 million at December 31, 2011 and $180 million at December 31, 2010. In light of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation, including mandating that 80% of
premiums revenue be expended on medical costs for individual commercial medical policies beginning in 2011, we completed a deferred acquisition cost recoverability analysis for our individual commercial medical policies during 2010. Our
recoverability test indicated that a substantial portion of unamortized deferred acquisition costs associated with the individual commercial medical block of business were not recoverable from future income. As a result, during 2010 we recorded a
write-down of deferred acquisition costs of $147 million with a corresponding charge to operating costs. 
18. REINSURANCE 
Certain blocks of insurance assumed in acquisitions, primarily life, long-term care, and annuities in run-off status,
are subject to reinsurance where some or all of the underwriting risk related to these policies has been ceded to a third party. In addition, a large portion of our reinsurance takes the form of 100% coinsurance agreements where, in addition to all
of the underwriting risk, all administrative responsibilities, including premium collections and claim payment, have also been ceded to a third party. We acquired these policies and related reinsurance agreements with the purchase of stock of
companies in which the policies were originally written. We acquired these companies for business reasons unrelated to these particular policies, including the companies other products and licenses necessary to fulfill strategic plans.
 A reinsurance agreement between two entities transfers the underwriting risk of policyholder liabilities to a reinsurer while
the primary insurer retains the contractual relationship with the ultimate insured. As such, these reinsurance agreements do not completely relieve us of our potential liability to the ultimate insured. However, given the transfer of underwriting
risk, our potential liability is limited to the credit exposure which exists should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements.  Reinsurance recoverables represent the portion of future policy benefits payable that are covered by reinsurance. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the methods
used to determine future policy benefits payable as detailed in Note 2. Reinsurance recoverables, included in other long-term assets, were $436 million at December 31, 2011 and $421 million at December 31, 2010. The percentage of these
reinsurance recoverables resulting from 100% coinsurance agreements was approximately 51% at December 31, 2011 and approximately 54% at December 31, 2010. Premiums ceded were $34 million in 2011, $34 million in 2010 and $33 million in
2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Humana Inc.:  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries (Company) at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements and Other Information 
We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report. The
consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts based on our estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been
presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements.  Our control environment is the
foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our Business Ethics Policy. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial
reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent outside directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal auditors and our independent
registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. Our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the Audit Committee
and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to members of senior management and the Board of Directors.  Based on
our evaluation as of December 31, 2011, we as the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer of the Company have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported as specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 We assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we determined that, as of
December 31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report which appears on page 127.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Michael B. McCallister

Humana Inc.  SCHEDULE IPARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL INFORMATION  NOTES TO CONDENSED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Parent company financial information has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and excludes the accounts of all operating subsidiaries. This information should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated financial statements. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
2. TRANSACTIONS WITH SUBSIDIARIES  Management Fee  Through intercompany service agreements approved, if
required, by state regulatory authorities, Humana Inc., our parent company, charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries including information systems, disbursement, investment and cash
administration, marketing, legal, finance, and medical and executive management oversight.  Dividends
 Cash dividends received from subsidiaries and included as a component of net cash provided by operating activities
were $1.1 billion in 2011, $747 million in 2010, and $774 million in 2009.  Guarantee 
Through indemnity agreements approved by state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by
our parent company in the event of insolvency for; (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services
rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent has also guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries. 
Notes Receivables from Operating Subsidiaries  We funded certain subsidiaries with surplus note agreements. These notes are generally non-interest bearing and may not be entered into or repaid without the prior approval of the applicable Departments
of Insurance.  Notes Payable to Operating Subsidiaries 
We borrowed funds from certain subsidiaries with notes generally collateralized by real estate. These notes, which have various payment
and maturity terms, bear interest ranging from 1.11% to 6.65% and are payable in 2012 and 2014. We recorded interest expense of $1 million related to these notes for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
3. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as
limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and
statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 
  143



Table of Contents
Humana Inc. 
SCHEDULE IPARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL INFORMATION  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)   
Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product
mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31,
2011 and 2010, respectively, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. The amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately $970 million in the
aggregate. This compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately $740 million. 
4. ACQUISITIONS  Refer
to Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of acquisitions. 
5. INCOME TAXES 
Refer to Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of income taxes.
The release of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in 2009 as a result of settlements associated with the completion of the audit of our U.S. income tax returns for 2005 and 2006, reduced tax expense $17 million in 2009. 
6. DEBT  Refer to
Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of debt. 
7. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  Refer to Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of stockholders equity, including stock repurchases and the April 2011
approval by our Board of Directors of the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy.
