PART I
 
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
 
Johnson Outdoors is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded seasonal, outdoor recreation products used primarily for fishing from a boat, diving, paddling, hiking and camping. The Company’s portfolio of well-known consumer brands has attained leading market positions due to continuous innovation, marketing excellence, product performance and quality.  Company values and culture support innovation in all areas, promoting and leveraging best practices and synergies within and across its subsidiaries to advance the Company’s strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.  The Company is controlled by Helen P. Johnson-Leipold (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), members of her family and related entities.
 
The Company was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1987 as successor to various businesses.
 
Marine Electronics
 
The Company’s Marine Electronic segment brands are: Minn Kota battery-powered fishing motors for quiet trolling or primary propulsion; Humminbird sonar and GPS equipment for fishfinding and navigation and Cannon downriggers for controlled-depth fishing.  In 2011, the Company acquired the LakeMaster brand of high-definition lake charts.  In 2012, the Company made a decision to extend its Humminbird brand to deep water navigation systems resulting in the discontinuation of the Geonav brand.
 
Marine Electronics brands and related accessories are sold across the globe, with approximately 85% of sales coming from North America through large outdoor specialty retailers, such as Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s; large retail store chains; marine products distributors; international distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of boat brands such as Tracker, Skeeter and Ranger; and internet retailers and distributors.
 
Marine Electronics has achieved market share gains by focusing on product innovation, quality products and effective marketing.  Such consumer marketing and promotion activities include: product placements on fishing-related television shows; print advertising and editorial coverage in outdoor, general interest and sport magazines; professional angler and tournament sponsorships; packaging and point-of-purchase materials and offers to increase consumer appeal and sales; branded websites; social media networks; and online promotions.
 
Outdoor Equipment
 
The Company’s Outdoor Equipment segment brands are:  Eureka! consumer, commercial and military tents and accessories, sleeping bags, camping furniture and other recreational camping products; Silva field compasses and digital instruments; and Tech40 performance measurement instruments.
 
Eureka! consumer tents, sleeping bags, camping furniture and other recreational camping products are mid- to high-price range products sold in the U.S. and Canada through independent sales representatives, primarily to camping and backpacking specialty stores, sporting goods stores, catalog and mail order houses and through internet retailers. Marketing of the Company’s tents, sleeping bags and other recreational camping products is focused on building the Eureka! brand name and establishing the Company as a leader in tent design and innovation. The Company’s camping tents and sleeping bags are produced by third party manufacturing sources in Asia.  Eureka! camping products are sold under license in Japan, Australia and Europe.
 
Eureka! commercial tents include party tents and accessories, sold primarily to general rental stores, and other commercial tents and accessories sold directly to tent erectors. The Company’s commercial tent products range from 10’x10’ canopies to 120’ wide pole tents and other large scale frame structures and are primarily manufactured by the Company at the Company’s Binghamton, New York location.

Commercial tent accessories include lighting systems, interior lining options, and mounting brackets that allow the interior of the tents to be customized to suit the occasion.  The Company believes there is a niche market for commercial tents outfitted with common, easy to use accessories.
 
Eureka! also designs and manufactures large, heavy-duty tents and lightweight backpacking tents for the military at its Binghamton, New York location. Tents produced for military use in the last twelve months include modular general purpose tents, rapid deployment shelters and various lightweight one and two person tents. The Company manufactures military tent accessories like fabric floors and insulated thermal liners and is also a subcontract manufacturer for other providers of military tents.
 
Silva field compasses are manufactured by the Company and marketed exclusively in North America where the Company owns Silva trademark rights. Tech40 digital instruments and other branded products are manufactured by third parties and are primarily sold in the North American market.
 
Watercraft
 
The Company’s Watercraft segment designs and markets Necky high performance sea touring kayaks; sit on top Ocean Kayaks; and Old Town canoes and kayaks for family recreation, touring and tripping.  With the exception of Necky fiberglass boats, these brands are manufactured at the Company’s facility in Old Town, Maine.
 
The Company uses a rotational molding process for manufacturing polyethylene kayaks and canoes to compete in the high volume, low and mid price range of the market. The Company uses a thermo-form molding process in the manufacturing of lower priced models.  The Company also markets canoes built from Royalex, a composite material comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam bonded together by heat treatment, and wood.  The Company’s United States warehouse and distribution center for all of its Watercraft brands is also located in Old Town, Maine.
 
Watercraft accessory brands, including Extrasport personal flotation devices and Carlisle branded paddles, are produced primarily by third-party sources.  The Company manufactures its Pacific brand kayaks in New Zealand and contracts for manufacturing of Watercraft products with third parties in New Hampshire and the Czech Republic.
 
The Company’s kayaks, canoes and accessories are sold through multiple channels in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific Basin with an emphasis on independent specialty retailers and large outdoor retailers such as Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s.
 
The Company’s Watercraft business competes in this segment by introducing product innovations, creating quality products and by focusing on the product-specific needs of each marketing channel.  Consumer marketing and promotion activities include: print advertising and editorial coverage in outdoor, general interest and sport magazines; direct marketing; branded websites and social media networks.
 
Diving
 
The Company manufactures and markets underwater diving products for recreational divers, which it sells and distributes under the SCUBAPRO and SUBGEAR brand names.
 
The Company markets a complete line of underwater diving and snorkeling equipment, including regulators, buoyancy compensators, dive computers and gauges, wetsuits, masks, fins, snorkels and accessories. SCUBAPRO diving equipment is marketed to the premium segment of the market for both diving enthusiasts and more advanced divers. SUBGEAR products are marketed to the value conscious recreational diver seeking quality and performance at an attractive price. Products are sold via select distribution to independent specialty dive stores worldwide. These specialty dive stores sell the Company’s products over the counter as well as through their own websites.  In addition, they generally provide a wide range of services to divers, including regular maintenance, product repair, diving education and travel programs.  The Company also sells diving gear to dive training centers, aquariums, resorts and armed forces around the world.
 
The Company focuses on maintaining and extending the SCUBAPRO brand as the market leader in innovation and quality. The SCUBAPRO brand is positioned to incorporate the Company’s latest innovations and designs.  The SUBGEAR brand benefits from sharing SCUBAPRO’s experienced research and development teams.  This two brand strategy and product positioning is driven by product feature and differentiation, price point and design.  SUBGEAR is a full line brand with an emphasis on life support and an even broader range of soft goods for the global market.  SCUBAPRO and SUBGEAR brands have been extended to include dive computers which had previously been marketed under the UWATEC brand.

The Company’s consumer communication focuses on building brand awareness and highlighting exclusive product features and consumer benefits of the SCUBAPRO and SUBGEAR product lines. The Company’s communication and distribution strategies reinforce the SCUBAPRO brand’s position as the industry’s quality and innovation leader. The Company markets its equipment in diving magazines, via websites and through information and displays in dive specialty stores. SUBGEAR’S full line of dive equipment and accessories compete in the mid-market on the basis of quality and performance at an affordable price.
 
The Company manufactures regulators, dive computers, gauges, and instruments at its Italian and Indonesian facilities.  The Company sources buoyancy compensators, neoprene goods, plastic products, proprietary materials, and other components from third parties.
 
Financial Information for Business Segments
 
As noted above, the Company has four reportable business segments. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information concerning each business segment.
 
International Operations
 
See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information regarding the Company’s domestic and international operations. See Note 1, subheading “Foreign Operations and Related Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information regarding risks related to the Company’s foreign operations.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company commits significant resources to new product research and development in each of its business segments.  Marine Electronics conducts its product research, design, engineering and software development activities at its locations in Mankato and Little Falls, Minnesota; Alpharetta, Georgia; Eufaula, Alabama; and Shanghai, China.  Diving maintains research and development facilities in Zurich, Switzerland and Casarza Ligure, Italy.  Research and development activities for Watercraft are performed in Bellingham, Washington and Old Town, Maine.  Product research, design and innovation for Outdoor Equipment products are conducted at the Company's Binghamton, New York location.
 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred, except for software development for new electronics products and bathymetry data collection and processing.  These costs are capitalized once technological feasibility is established and then amortized over the expected useful life of the software or database. The amounts expensed by the Company in connection with research and development activities for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations included elsewhere in this report.
 
Industry and Competitive Environment
 
The Company believes its products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance and marketing support and, to a lesser extent, price.
 
Marine Electronics:  Minn Kota’s main competitors in the electric trolling motors business are Motor Guide, owned by Brunswick Corporation, and private label branded motors sourced primarily from manufacturers in Asia.  Competition in this business is focused on technological innovation, product quality and durability as well as product benefits and features for fishing.
 
Humminbird’s main competitors in the market for on-boat electronics used in deep water (i.e. the Great Lakes and oceans)  are Raymarine, Simrad, Furuno and Garmin.  Lowrance and Garmin are Humminbird’s primary competitors for products used on freshwater inland lakes.  Competition in this business is primarily focused on the quality of sonar imaging and display, easy to use graphical interfaces as well as the integration of mapping and GPS technology.

Cannon’s main competitors in the downrigger market are Big Jon, Walker and Scotty. Competition in this business primarily focuses on ease of operation, speed and durability.
 
LakeMaster’s main competitors in the lake chart market are Navionics and Jeppesen.  Competition in this business focuses primarily on quality of data and quantity of available charts for inland lakes and ocean shoreline.
 
Outdoor Equipment:  The Company’s outdoor equipment brands and products compete in the sporting goods and specialty segments of the outdoor equipment market. Competitive brands with a strong position in the sporting goods channel include Coleman and private label brands. The Company also competes with specialty companies such as Kelty, The North Face and Marmot on the basis of materials and innovative designs for consumers who want performance products priced at a value.
 
The Company’s competitors in the Commercial tent market include Anchor Industries and Aztec for tension, frame and canopy tents.  Competition in the commercial tent business is based on price, quality, structure, styling, ease of installation and technical support.
 
The Company sells military tents to prime vendors and third party distributors who hold supply contracts primarily with the U.S. Government.  Such supply contracts can be for commercial off-the-shelf products in addition to products required to be built to unique specifications.  Competitors in the military tent business include HDT, DHS Systems, Alaska Structures, Camel, Outdoor Venture, and Diamond Brand.
 
Watercraft:  The Company primarily competes in the kayak and canoe product categories of the paddlesports market. The Company’s main competitors in this market are Confluence Watersports, Pelican, Wenonah Canoe, Jackson Kayak and Legacy Paddlesports, each of which competes on the basis of their product’s design, performance, quality and price.
 
Diving:  The main competitors in Diving include Aqualung Group, Suunto and Mares.  Competitive advantage in the life support product category of this segment, which consists of regulators, dive computers, and buoyancy compensators, is a function of product innovation, performance, quality and safety.
 
Competition in the general diving product category of fins, masks, snorkels and wetsuits is characterized by low barriers to entry and numerous competitors who compete on the basis of product innovation, performance, quality and price.
 
Backlog
 
Unfilled orders for future delivery of products totaled approximately $41.7 million at September 28, 2012.  For the majority of its products, the Company’s businesses do not receive significant orders in advance of expected shipment dates, with the exception of the military tent business which has orders outstanding based on contractual agreements.
 
Employees
 
At September 28, 2012, the Company had approximately 1,100 regular, full-time employees. The Company considers its employee relations to be excellent. Temporary employees are utilized primarily to manage peaks in the seasonal manufacturing of products.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
 
The Company owns various patents covering the Humminbird Side Imagingä sonar technology used in its fishfinder products.  Side Imagingä sonar technology is used across a broad range of the Company’s Humminbird product portfolio and has been a key driver behind the brand’s growth over the past four years.  The Company also holds various patents for diving products and electric motors, amongst other products, and regularly files applications for patents.
 
The Company has numerous trademarks and trade names which it considers important to its business, many of which are noted in this report. Historically, the Company has vigorously defended its intellectual property rights and expects to continue to do so.

Supply Chain and Sourcing of Materials
 
The Company manufactures some products that use materials that, due to geographical distance, limited supplier capacity or competing demands for such materials, are only available in a cost effective manner from a single vendor or require the Company to place orders several months in advance of required delivery.
 
In the past, the Company has experienced product and component shortages in its Marine Electronics and Diving businesses.  The Company mitigates such product availability and supply chain risks through purchase of safety stocks, forecast-based supply contracts, and to a lesser extent with just in time inventory deliveries or supplier-owned inventory located close to the Company’s manufacturing locations.  The Company strives to balance the businesses’ need to maintain adequate inventory levels with the cost of holding such inventory by manufacturing to forecast for high volume products, utilizing build-to-order strategies wherever possible, and by having contract manufactured products delivered to customers directly from the supplier.  The Company also seeks to manage its inventory through on-going product design and logistical initiatives with its suppliers to reduce lead times.
 
As military contracts require utilization of domestic suppliers, the Company is limited to key vendors for materials used in its military tent business. Interruption or loss in the availability of these materials could have a material adverse impact on the sales and operating results of the Company’s Outdoor Equipment business.
 
A significant driver of the delivered cost of the Company’s watercraft products is fuel prices.  The Company seeks to mitigate this cost through negotiated fuel surcharge rates with its shipping firms and by optimizing the loads and routing of its deliveries to customers.
 
Most of the Company’s products are made using materials that are generally in adequate supply and are available from a variety of third party suppliers.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s products are outdoor recreation-related, which results in seasonal variations in sales and profitability. This seasonal variability is due to customers’ increasing their inventories in the quarters ending March and June, the primary selling season for the Company’s outdoor recreation products, with lower inventory volumes during the quarters ending September and December. The Company mitigates the seasonality of its businesses somewhat by encouraging customers to purchase and take delivery of products more evenly through the year.  The following table shows, for the past three fiscal years, the total net sales and operating profit or loss of the Company for each quarter, as a percentage of the total year.

Environment and Climate Change
 
The Company is subject to various supra national, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of governmental authorities.  We believe we comply with such laws and regulations.  Expenditures on environmental compliance have not had, and we believe in the future, will not have, a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  We do not believe that any direct or indirect consequences of legislation related to climate change will have a material effect on our operating costs, facilities or products.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS
 
The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our future business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
 
Our net sales and profitability depend on our ability to continue to conceive, design and market products that appeal to our consumers.
 
Our business depends on our ability to continue to conceive, design, manufacture and market new products and upon continued market acceptance of our product offering. Rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends make it difficult to predict how long consumer demand for our existing products will continue or what new products will be successful. A decline in consumer demand for our products, our failure to develop new products on a timely basis in anticipation of changing consumer preferences or the failure of our new products to achieve and sustain consumer acceptance could reduce our net sales and profitability.
 
Competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability.
 
We operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with several large domestic and foreign companies such as Brunswick, Lowrance, Garmin, Confluence and Aqualung/U.S. Divers, with private label products sold by many of our retail customers and with other producers of outdoor recreation products. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, we may face competition from new participants in our markets because the outdoor recreation product industries have limited barriers to entry. We experience price competition for our products, and competition for shelf space at retailers, all of which may increase in the future. If we cannot compete in our product markets successfully in the future, our net sales and profitability will likely decline.
 
General economic conditions affect the Company’s results.


Our revenues are affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence worldwide, but especially in the United States and Europe.  In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affects demand for our products.  Moreover, our businesses are cyclical in nature, and their success is impacted by general economic conditions and specific economic conditions affecting the regions and markets we serve, the overall level of consumer confidence in the economy and discretionary income levels.  Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions that diminish consumer confidence or discretionary income can reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results.  Moreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets that may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  The impact of weak consumer credit markets, corporate restructurings, layoffs, continued high unemployment rates, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel prices and increases in federal and state taxation all can negatively affect our operating results.


Intellectual property disputes relating to our products could increase our costs.
 
Our industry is susceptible to litigation regarding patent infringement and infringement of other intellectual property rights. We could be either a plaintiff or a defendant in trademark, patent and/or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims and claims of breach of license from time to time. The prosecution or defense of any intellectual property litigation is both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management, even if the claim or defense against us is without merit. We could also be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation.
 
Furthermore, we may rely on trade secret law to protect technologies and proprietary information that we cannot or have chosen not to patent. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to maintain protection through confidentiality agreements with necessary personnel, contractors and consultants, we cannot guarantee that such contracts will not be breached. Further, confidentiality agreements may conflict with other agreements which personnel, contractors and consultants have signed with prior employers or clients. In the event of a breach of a confidentiality agreement or the divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our trade secret protection. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from the Company’s business.  Any of these negative events could adversely affect our profitability or operating results.

Impairment charges could impact our future financial position and results of operations.
 
We test our goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or applicable asset or group of assets below its carrying value. Various uncertainties, including significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in consumer preferences could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets, and may result in an impairment of those assets.  Although any such impairment charge would be a non-cash expense, any impairment of our assets could materially increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. 
 
Sales of our products are seasonal, which causes our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
 
Sales of our products are seasonal. Historically, our net sales and profitability have peaked in the second and third fiscal quarters due to the buying patterns of our customers for our products. Seasonal variations in operating results may also cause us to increase our debt levels and interest expense primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters as we fund our working capital requirements.
 
The trading price of shares of our common stock fluctuates and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.
 
The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. The trading price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:
 



 ●
 
the timing of our announcements or those of our competitors concerning significant product developments, acquisitions or financial performance;

●
 
fluctuation in our quarterly operating results;

 ●
 
substantial sales of our common stock;

 ●
 
general stock market conditions; or

 ●
 
other economic or external factors.


 
You may be unable to sell your stock at or above your purchase price.
 
A limited number of our shareholders can exert significant influence over the Company.
 
As of November 30, 2012, Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, members of her family and related entities (hereinafter the Johnson Family), held approximately 77% of the voting power of both classes of our common stock taken as a whole. This voting power would permit these shareholders, if they chose to act together, to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.  Moreover, certain members of the Johnson Family have entered into a voting trust agreement covering approximately 96% of our outstanding class B common shares.  This voting trust agreement permits these shareholders, if they continue to choose to act together, to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.
 
We may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.
 
We have, as part of our strategy, historically pursued strategic acquisitions.  The pursuit of future growth through acquisitions, including participation in joint ventures, involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks associated with integrating strategic acquisitions include:
 



 ●
 
the acquired business may experience losses which could adversely affect our profitability;

●
 
unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses and reduce our profitability;

 ●
 
possible failure to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer of licenses or other agreements of the acquired company;

 ●
 
possible failure to maintain customer, licensor and other relationships of the acquired company after the closing of the transaction with the acquired company;

 ●
 
difficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses;

 ●
 
diversion of our management’s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our other business operations; and

 ●
 
unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.


 

We are dependent upon certain key members of management.
 
Our success will depend to a significant degree on the abilities and efforts of our senior management. Moreover, our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, marketing, technical and sales personnel. These people are in high demand and often have competing employment opportunities. The labor market for skilled employees is highly competitive and we may lose key employees or be forced to increase their compensation to retain these people. Employee turnover could significantly increase our training and other related employee costs. The loss of key personnel, or the failure to attract qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 

Sources of and fluctuations in market prices of raw materials can affect our operating results.


The primary raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are metals, resins and packaging materials. These materials are generally available from a number of suppliers, but we have chosen to concentrate our sourcing with a limited number of vendors for each commodity or purchased component. We believe our sources of raw materials are reliable and adequate for our needs. However, the development of future sourcing issues related to the availability of these materials as well as significant fluctuations in the market prices of these materials may have an adverse effect on our financial results.


Our profitability is also affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials we use in our products, including the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on raw materials and purchased components.  We may not be able to pass along any price increases in our raw materials or other component costs to our customers.  As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with the manufacturing of our products could increase our costs of sales and reduce our gross margins.

 
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the Company’s results.
 
We have significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we have operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 23% of our revenues for the year ended September 28, 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 12% were denominated in euros, with the remaining 11% denominated in various other foreign currencies. We may mitigate a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the purchase of foreign currency swaps, forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments denominated in foreign currencies or to reduce the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency borrowings.
 
Because we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell products in foreign markets, we are susceptible to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products.
 
Our international operations subject us to risks, including:
 



 ●
 
economic and political instability;

 ●
 
restrictive actions by foreign governments;

 ●
 
opportunity costs and reputational damage related to the presence of counterfeit versions of the Company’s products in such foreign markets;

 ●
 
greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;

 ●
 
changes in import duties or import or export restrictions;

 ●
 
timely shipping of product and unloading of product, including the timely rail/truck delivery to our warehouses and/or a customer’s warehouse of our products;

 ●
 
complications in complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the importation of goods, including duties, quotas and taxes; and

 ●
 
complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws.


 
 


  


10





  


 
Any of these risks, including the cost of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws, could disrupt the supply of our products or increase our expenses.  In particular, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring efforts by European governments may cause the value of several European currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar sales and earnings.  As we have manufacturing operations in Italy, a significant disruption of the political or financial systems there could put these manufacturing operations at risk, which could ultimately adversely affect our profitability or operating results.
 
We are subject to environmental and safety regulations.
 
We are subject to supra national, federal, state, local and foreign laws and other legal requirements related to the generation, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of materials as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (as amended), the Clean Air Act (as amended) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (as amended). We believe that our existing environmental management system is adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in the environmental area. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of our compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws or other legal requirements. However, risk of environmental liability and changes associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business and there is no assurance that material liabilities or changes would not arise.
 
We rely on our credit facilities to provide us with sufficient working capital to operate our business.
 
Historically, we have relied upon our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate working capital to operate our business.  The availability of borrowing amounts under our revolving credit facilities is generally dependent upon the amount and quality of the accounts receivable and inventory collateralizing our credit facilities.  As a result, the bankruptcy of a major customer could have a significant negative impact on the availability of borrowing amounts under our revolving credit facilities.  If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs and/or we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our working capital requirements or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities.  We can make no assurance that we will be successful in ensuring our availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in connection with raising additional capital and that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements.  If we are not able to maintain our borrowing availability under our credit facilities and/or raise additional capital when needed, we may be forced to sharply curtail our efforts to manufacture and promote the sale of our products or to curtail our operations.  Ultimately, we may be forced to cease operations.
 
Our debt covenants may limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions.
 
Our credit facilities and certain other of our debt instruments include limitations on a number of our activities, including our ability to:
 



 ●
 
incur additional debt;

 ●
 
create liens on our assets or make guarantees;

 ●
 
make certain investments or loans;

 ●
 
pay dividends; or

 ●
 
dispose of or sell assets, make acquisitions above certain amounts or enter into a merger or similar transaction.


 
Our credit facilities also contain a number of financial covenants.  The restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long term interests.  A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities could result in a default under these facilities.  If a default occurs, the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings and to exercise any other rights they have under the facilities or applicable law.

Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.
 
Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of similar companies, which are exchanged, listed or quoted on NASDAQ. We believe there are 3,958,699 shares of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates as of November 30, 2012. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading price for our shares of common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
 
Our business is susceptible to adverse weather conditions or events.
 
Our success is in part affected by adverse weather conditions, including fires, floods, tornados and other natural disasters. Such events have the tendency to create fluctuations in demand for our products which may impact our borrowing costs, increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.  Moreover, our profitability is affected by our ability to successfully manage our inventory levels and demand for our products, which, in part depends upon the efficient operation of our production and delivery systems. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from the aforementioned natural disasters.  Such natural disasters could adversely impact our ability to meet delivery requirements of our customers, which may result in our need to incur extra costs to expedite production and delivery of product to meet customer demand. Any of these events could negatively impact our profitability.

                        EQUITY SECURITIES





 
Certain information with respect to this item is included in Notes 9 and 10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The Company’s Class A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global MarketSM under the symbol: JOUT. There is no public market for the Company’s Class B common stock. However, the Class B common stock is convertible at all times at the option of the holder into shares of Class A common stock on a share for share basis. As of November 28, 2012, the Company had 705 holders of record of its Class A common stock and 30 holders of record of its Class B common stock. We believe the number of beneficial owners of our Class A common stock on that date was substantially greater.
 
A summary of the high and low closing prices for the Company’s Class A common stock during each quarter of the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and October 1, 2010 is as follows:

The following limitations apply to the ability of the Company to pay dividends:
 



 ●
 
Pursuant to the Company’s revolving credit and security agreement, dated September 29, 2009, as amended, the Company is limited in the amount of restricted payments (primarily dividends and repurchases of common stock) made during each fiscal year. The Company may declare, and pay, dividends in accordance with historical practices, but in no event may the aggregate amount of all dividends for any fiscal year exceed 25% of the Company’s net income for that fiscal year.

 
 
 

 ●
 
The Company’s Articles of Incorporation provide that no dividend, other than a dividend payable in shares of the Company’s common stock, may be declared or paid upon the Class B common stock unless such dividend is declared or paid upon both classes of common stock. Whenever a dividend (other than a dividend payable in shares of Company common stock) is declared or paid upon any shares of Class B common stock, at the same time there must be declared and paid a dividend on shares of Class A common stock equal in value to 110% of the amount per share of the dividend declared and paid on shares of Class B common stock. Whenever a dividend is payable in shares of Company common stock, such dividend must be declared or paid at the same rate on the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock.

ITEM 7.          MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





 
Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than per share amounts, are stated in thousands.
 
Executive Overview
 
The Company designs, manufactures and markets high quality recreational products for the outdoor enthusiast. Through a combination of innovative products, strong marketing, a talented and passionate workforce and efficient distribution, the Company seeks to set itself apart from the competition. Its subsidiaries operate as a network that promotes innovation and leverages best practices and synergies, following the strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
The Company’s fiscal 2012 revenues improved by 1.2% while operating profit grew 21.2% from the prior year.  Sales reflect the year over year unfavorable impact of currency translation of 1.3%.  The increase in operating margin in the current year over the prior year was impacted in part by favorable legal and insurance settlements during the year as well as profits driven by the increased Marine Electronics sales volume and margin improvements in the Diving business. Net income of $10,134 decreased by $22,510 over fiscal 2011 due significantly to a $30,186 increase in tax expense which related primarily to the reversal of a valuation reserve for deferred tax assets in the prior year.

Fiscal 2012 vs Fiscal 2011
 
Net Sales
 
Net sales in 2012 increased 1.2% to $412,292 compared to $407,422 in 2011.  The increase was driven primarily by the success of the Marine Electronics business in the U.S. which more than offset the negative effect of foreign currency translation in Diving and sluggish to declining sales in Watercraft and Outdoor Equipment.


Net sales for the Marine Electronics business increased $9,119, or 4.1% during 2012.  Innovative products such as Minn Kota’s i-Pilot wireless GPS trolling system and increased OEM sales helped fuel the growth.
 
Outdoor Equipment net sales decreased $3,554, or 9.1%, in 2012 primarily due to a slowdown in the consumer camping market and further declines in U.S. military spending.
 
The Watercraft business experienced an increase in sales of approximately 1%, or $469, due primarily to high volumes of low margin product sold to outdoor retailers and the sale of inventory to a distributor related to the closure of the UK sales office.
 
Net sales for the Diving business declined $1,549, or 1.7%, year over year, due primarily to $3,825, or 4.3%, of unfavorable currency translation, which more than offset increased sales in the U.S. and Asian markets.
 
Cost of Sales
 
Cost of sales was $247,970, or 60.1% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 28, 2012 compared to $244,287 or 60.0% of net sales in the prior year.  Costs of raw materials and components increased only slightly over the prior year while increases in labor rates were largely offset by process improvement efforts in each of the businesses.


Gross Profit
 
Gross profit of $164,322 was 39.9% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 28, 2012 compared to $163,135 or 40.0% of net sales in the prior year.
 
Gross profit in the Marine Electronics business increased $2,685 from the prior year due primarily to the 9.1% increase in sales volume, which was offset in part by inventory write-offs and other costs related to the closure of the European office.
 
Gross profit in the Outdoor Equipment business decreased $1,099 from 2011 due to decreases in sales, but increased as a percent of net sales from 36.7% in the prior year to 37.3% in 2012.  The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2012 was largely driven by the impact of the flood in the prior year results and a favorable mix in the military tent business in the current year.
 
Gross profit in the Watercraft segment was $1,800 lower than 2011 levels and decreased as a percent of sales from 32.5% in 2011 to 29.2% in 2012.  The decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the mix of lower priced product as well as the closure of the U.K. sales office and the sale of its remaining inventory to a distributor at low margins.
 
Gross profit for the Diving segment increased by $1,363 and increased as a percentage of sales from 48.2% in 2011 to 50.6% in 2012.  The increase in margin was driven primarily by price increases implemented in the current year to address the impact of cost increases in the prior year.

Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses overall decreased from the prior year by $2,556.  The decrease was driven by a $3,500 favorable settlement with an insurance carrier that was recognized as an expense reduction in the Company’s second fiscal quarter and $2,600 of lower legal expenses, offset in part by an increase in bad debt expense, higher incentive compensation expense, and higher deferred compensation expense resulting from the increase in the market value of the non-qualified plan’s assets.
 
Operating expenses for the Marine Electronics segment decreased by $1,470 from 2011 levels.  The decrease was due mainly to lower legal and warranty costs offset in part by higher incentive compensation and severance costs related to the closure of the European office.
 
Outdoor Equipment operating expenses decreased by $934 from their levels in 2011 due primarily to the recovery of flood related losses in the current year versus flood related expenses incurred in the prior year.  See further discussion of the impact of the flooding at Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
The Watercraft business saw a decline in operating expenses of $2,743 from the prior year due primarily to the favorable insurance settlement of $3,500 which was partially offset by costs related to the closure of the U.K. office and restructuring activities in the U.S.  See further discussion of the impact of the insurance settlement at Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
Operating expenses for the Diving business decreased by $1,434 due primarily to the $1,636 favorable impact of currency translation which was offset in part by higher bad debt expense driven by the economic conditions in southern Europe.


Operating Results
 
The Company’s operating profit was $21,413 in 2012 compared to an operating profit of $17,670 in fiscal 2011.  Marine Electronics operating profit increased by $4,156 from the prior year. Outdoor Equipment operating profit declined year over year from $2,996 to $2,831.  The Watercraft business incurred an operating loss in 2012 of $408, compared to a loss of $1,351 in the prior year.  Diving operating profit increased $2,798 from the prior year.


Other Income and Expenses
 
Interest expense decreased from the prior year by $962, due largely to lower principal balances, decreases in interest rates and lower expense for amortization of interest rate swaps. Interest income was approximately $100 in both years.
 
Other income of $631 in fiscal 2012 compared to other expense of $2,290 in the prior year.  The current year included currency losses of $213 which were more than offset by market gains of $1,320 on deferred compensation plan assets.  In the prior year, this line item included $1,701 of currency losses and market losses of $253 on the deferred compensation plan assets.  Market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in Other Income and Expense are offset in full in Operating Expenses.
 
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
 
The Company realized pretax income of $19,926 in fiscal 2012, compared to pretax income of $12,250 in fiscal 2011. The Company recorded income tax expense of $9,792 in 2012 compared to $20,394 of income tax benefit in 2011.  The 2011 benefit reflected the net reduction of the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance which was a result of the Company’s determination at the end of fiscal 2011 that it was more likely than not to realize the majority of its deferred tax assets.  See further discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this report.
 
Net Income
 
The Company recognized net income of $10,134 in fiscal 2012, or $1.03 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $32,644 in fiscal 2011, or $3.36 per diluted common share, based on the factors discussed above.

Fiscal 2011 vs Fiscal 2010
 
Net Sales
 
Net sales in 2011 increased 6.5% to $407,422 compared to $382,432 in 2010.  The increase was driven primarily by the success of new products in the Marine Electronics business.  Those sales, in addition to favorable foreign currency translations which positively impacted sales by $6,367 in comparison to 2010, more than offset significant declines in sales in the Outdoor Equipment and Watercraft businesses.


Net sales for the Marine Electronics business increased $36,621, or 19.7%, during 2011.  Both the Minn Kota and Humminbird brands grew by over 20% in all channels and each exceeded $100 million in sales.  The increases were primarily the result of the introduction of successful new products including Talon shallow water anchors and Humminbird Down Imaging fishfinders.
 
Outdoor Equipment net sales decreased $9,808 in 2011, or 20.1%, primarily due to significant reductions in military spending and the temporary closure of the Binghamton, New York facility due to the flood that occurred in September 2011.  See further discussion of the impact of the flooding at Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
The Watercraft business experienced a decline in sales of $6,269, or 9.8%, across all sales channels and all brands.  Both a slow start to the paddling season due to unfavorable weather conditions and overall weak demand were the primary drivers leading to the decline year over year.
 
The Diving business saw an increase in sales of $4,468, or 5.3% year over year, due in large part to favorable currency translation of $3,656, or 4.3% year over year, as well as wider distribution of the new SUBGEAR brand and increased SCUBAPRO demand.
 
Cost of Sales
 
Cost of sales was 60.0% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $228,909 or 59.9% of net sales in 2010.  The cost of sales increase of $15,378 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume during 2011 as compared to 2010.


Gross Profit
 
Gross profit of $163,135 was 40.0% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $153,523 million or 40.1% of net sales in the prior year.  The gross profit increase of $9,612 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume during 2011 as compared to 2010.
 
Gross profit in the Marine Electronics business increased $16,209 from 2010 due to higher sales volume.  Favorable product mix and increased efficiencies resulting from the higher sales volumes improved this segment’s gross profit as a percent of net sales from 38.1% in 2010 to 39.1% in 2011.
 
Gross profit in the Outdoor Equipment business decreased $3,738 from 2010, and declined as a percent of net sales from 37.0% to 36.7% in 2011 primarily due to lower volumes and the related reduced absorption of fixed costs.
 
Gross profit in the Watercraft segment was 32.5% of net sales in 2011 and was $3,695 lower than 2010 levels, which were equal to 35.1% of net sales.  The decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower sales volumes and reduced absorption of fixed costs.
 
Gross profit for the Diving segment increased by $828 but decreased as a percentage of sales from 49.7% in 2010 to 48.2% in 2011 primarily due to increases in product and component costs.


Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses increased in 2011 from 2010 by $6,497.  The increase was mainly attributable to higher direct expenses related to higher sales volumes, increased R&D spending and higher legal costs.
 
 


  


20





  


 
Operating expenses for the Marine Electronics segment increased by $9,073 from 2010 levels.  The increase was due mainly to increased direct expenses as the result of higher sales volumes and increased legal costs.
 
Outdoor Equipment operating expenses decreased by $854 from 2010 levels due primarily to lower marketing related costs which were driven by the declines in sales volume during 2011.
 
The Watercraft business saw a decline in operating expenses of $517 from 2010 due primarily to lower direct expenses driven by lower sales volume which were offset in part by increased freight costs.
 
Operating expenses for the Diving business increased by $249 due primarily to the $2,067 unfavorable impact of currency translation which was largely offset by the effects of cost reduction efforts undertaken in this segment.


Operating Results
 
The Company’s operating profit was $17,670 in 2011 compared to an operating profit of $14,554 in fiscal 2010.  Marine Electronics operating profit increased by $7,136 from the prior year. Outdoor Equipment operating profit declined to $2,996, half the level of 2010.  The Watercraft business incurred an operating loss in 2011 of $1,351, compared to an operating profit of $1,826 in 2010, a decline of $3,177.  Diving operating profit increased $580 from the prior year.


Other Income and Expenses
 
Interest expense decreased from the prior year by $1,837, due largely to lower amortization of interest rate swaps and interest rate decreases which resulted from renegotiating and amending the Company’s debt agreements during 2011. Interest income was less than $100 in both years.
 
Other expense of $2,290 in fiscal 2011 compared to $367 in the prior year.  The other expense in 2011 reflected currency losses of $1,701 and market losses of $382 on deferred compensation plan assets.  In the 2010, this line item included $1,175 of currency losses offset in part by market gains of $730 on the deferred compensation plan assets.
 
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
 
The Company realized pretax income of $12,250 in fiscal 2011, compared to pretax income of $9,192 in fiscal 2010. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $20,394 in 2011 compared to $2,653 of income tax expense in 2010.  The 2011 income tax benefit reflected the net reduction of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance which was due primarily to the Company’s determination at the end of fiscal 2011 that it was more likely than not to realize the majority of its deferred tax assets.  See further discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this report.
 
Net Income
 
The Company recognized net income of $32,644 in fiscal 2011, or $3.36 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $6,539 in fiscal 2010, or $0.68 per diluted common share, based on the factors discussed above.

The Company’s term loans have a maturity date of September 29, 2029.  Each term loan requires monthly payments of principal and interest. Interest on the aggregate outstanding amount of the term loans is based on the prime rate plus an applicable margin.  The interest rate in effect on the term loans was 5.25% at September 28, 2012.


The term loans are guaranteed in part under the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development program and are secured with a first priority lien on land, buildings, machinery and equipment of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and a second lien on working capital and certain patents and trademarks of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Any proceeds from the sale of secured property are first applied against the related term loans and then against the Revolvers.


The aggregate term loan borrowings are subject to a pre-payment penalty.  The penalty is currently 8% of the pre-payment amount, and the penalty will decrease by 1% annually on the anniversary date of the effective date of the loan agreement.


On November 16, 2010, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into amendments to their Revolving Credit Agreements (or “Revolvers”).  The amended terms of the Revolvers, maturing on November 16, 2014, provide for funding of up to $75,000, with an accordion feature that provides the Company with the option to increase the maximum seasonal financing availability by $25,000 subject to the approval of the lenders. Borrowing availability under the Revolvers is based on certain eligible working capital assets, primarily accounts receivable and inventory of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Revolvers contain a seasonal line reduction that reduces the maximum amount of borrowings to $50,000 during the period from mid-July to mid-November, consistent with the Company's reduced working capital needs throughout that period, and requires an annual seasonal pay down provision that reduces the borrowing capacity to $30,000 for 60 consecutive days.  The amendments to the Revolvers reset the interest rate calculation each quarter,  by instituting an applicable margin based on the Company’s leverage ratio for the trailing twelve month period.  The applicable margin ranges from 2.25% to 3.0%.


The interest rate on the Revolvers is based on LIBOR or the prime rate, at the Company’s discretion, plus an applicable margin.  The interest rate in effect on the Revolvers at September 28, 2012, based primarily on LIBOR, was approximately 2.50%.


The Revolvers are secured with a first priority lien on working capital assets and certain patents and trademarks of the Company and its subsidiaries and a second priority lien on land, buildings, machinery and equipment of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.  As cash collections related to secured assets are applied against the balance outstanding under the Revolvers, the liability is classified as current.  The Company’s remaining borrowing availability under the Revolvers was approximately $28,100 at September 28, 2012.


Under the terms of the Revolvers, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants.  Among other restrictions, the Company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and make acquisitions or divestitures above certain amounts.  The key financial covenants include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, limits on minimum net worth and EBITDA, a limit on capital expenditures, and, as noted above, a seasonal pay-down requirement.


See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this report regarding additional information on the Company’s borrowing arrangements, including certain amendments entered into by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in connection with the Company’s Revolvers.
 
As of September 28, 2012, the Company held approximately $46,400 of cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts in foreign taxing jurisdictions.

The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers’ compensation insurance. Letters of credit outstanding at September 28, 2012 were $1,401 compared to $2,103 on September 30, 2011 and were included in the Company’s total loan availability.  The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of September 28, 2012.  The Company had no unsecured lines of credit as of September 28, 2012.
 
The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
The Company anticipates making contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of $1,140 through September 27, 2013.
 
On November 14, 2012, subsequent to the end of the Company’s most recent fiscal year the Company acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Jetboil, Inc. (“Jetboil”).  Jetboil, founded and based in Manchester, New Hampshire, designs and manufactures the world’s top brand of outdoor cooking systems.  The approximately $16,000 acquisition was funded with existing cash and credit facilities.  The Company believes that sales of Jetboil’s innovative cooking products can be expanded through the Company’s global marketing and distribution network and both companies will benefit from an increased presence in the outdoor Specialty trade channel.  The Jetboil acquisition will be included in the Company’s Outdoor Equipment segment.  The Company anticipates that Jetboil will contribute approximately $10,000 of sales and $1,500 of operating profit to fiscal 2013 results.
 
The Company is currently in the process of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in this business combination.

 
Market Risk Management
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 23% of the Company’s revenues for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Approximately 12% were denominated in euros, with the remaining 11% denominated in various other foreign currencies.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.
 
 


  


24





  


 
The Company mitigates a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Foreign currency forward contracts enable the Company to lock in the foreign currency exchange rate for a fixed amount of currency to be paid or received on a specified date in the future. The Company uses such foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on financial instruments and known commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
The Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company’s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts receivable are collected and cash is accumulated or debt is repaid.  The Company’s goal in managing its interest rate risk is to maintain a mix of floating rate and fixed rate debt such that permanent non-equity capital needs are largely funded with long term fixed rate debt and seasonal working capital needs are funded with short term floating rate debt.
 
When the appropriate mix of fixed rate or floating rate debt cannot be directly obtained in a cost effective manner, the Company may enter into interest rate swap contracts in order to change floating rate interest into fixed rate interest or vice versa for a specific amount of debt in order to achieve the desired proportions of floating rate and fixed rate debt.  An interest rate swap is a contract in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.  The notional amount is the equivalent amount of debt that the Company wishes to change from a fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate or vice versa and is the basis for calculating the related interest payments required under the interest rate swap contract.
 
Commodities
 
Certain components used in the Company’s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancelable supply contracts. Primary commodity price exposures include costs associated with metals, resins and packaging materials.
 
Impact of Inflation
 
The Company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and, accordingly, the prices of its products. The Company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies. Price increases and, in certain situations, price decreases are implemented for individual products, when appropriate.
 
The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.  The Company does not believe that inflation has significantly affected its results of operations.
 
Sensitivity to Changes in Value
 
The estimates that follow are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value or earnings the Company could lose in one year from adverse changes in market interest rates. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings that the Company expects to incur. The estimates do not consider favorable changes in market rates. The table below presents the estimated maximum potential loss in fair value and annual income before income taxes from a 100 basis point movement in interest rates on the Company's term loans outstanding at September 28, 2012:

Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The Company’s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related footnote disclosures.  On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates for product returns, bad debts, inventories, long lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, litigation and other subjective matters impacting the financial statements.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
 
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria have been met: 
 



 ●
 
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.  Contracts, internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.

 
 
 

 ●
 
All substantial risk of ownership transfers to the customer.  Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.

 
 
 

 ●
 
The fee is fixed or determinable.  This is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

 
 
 

 ●
 
Collectability is reasonably assured.  We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as by the customer’s payment history.


 
Estimated costs of returns and allowances and discounts are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances.  Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates and any specific customer collection issues the Company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.
 
Inventories
 
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or market. Management’s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs. Inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. The Company also considers current forecast plans, as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels. Though the Company considers these balances to be adequate, changes in economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.

Deferred Taxes
 
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.  Such an adjustment was made during fiscal 2011.  See further discussion of the impact of the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairment
 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.  Generally, annual impairment tests are performed by the Company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
 
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates.  Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.  If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
 
The discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate fair value requires a number of key estimates and assumptions.  We estimate the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs.  We apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation.  This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which includes certain assumptions made by management such as market capital structure, market betas, the risk-free rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing.  Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year.
 
A number of factors, many of which the Company has no ability to control, could affect its financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparing its financial statements.  These factors include:  a prolonged global economic crisis, a significant decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the Company’s competitors to gain market share.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
 
We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as unplanned negative cash flow indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Application of alternative assumptions, such as changes in estimate of future cash flows, could produce significantly different results. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
 
Warranties
 
The Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services. Warranty reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. Estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience, expectation of future conditions and known product issues. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required. The Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers, to help minimize warranty obligations.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Company carried out an evaluation as of September 28, 2012, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2012 at reaching a level of reasonable assurance.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  The Company has designed its disclosure controls and procedures to reach a level of reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 
The management of Johnson Outdoors Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
 




(a)


pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;



 




(b)


provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and



 




(c)


provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of September 28, 2012, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

Johnson Outdoors Inc.




We have audited Johnson Outdoors Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Johnson Outdoors Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, Johnson Outdoors Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of Johnson Outdoors Inc. and our report dated December 11, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

Johnson Outdoors Inc.




We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson Outdoors Inc. as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnson Outdoors Inc. as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Johnson Outdoors Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 11, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Johnson Outdoors Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 28, 2012
 
(in thousands except share and per share amounts)
 

1         SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





 
Business
 
Johnson Outdoors Inc. (the “Company”) is an integrated, global outdoor recreation products company engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of brand name outdoor equipment, diving, watercraft and marine electronics products.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson Outdoors Inc. and all majority owned subsidiaries and are stated in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and operating results and the disclosure of commitments and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
 
Fiscal Year
 
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest September 30. The fiscal years ended September 28, 2012 (hereinafter 2012), September 30, 2011 (hereinafter 2011) and October 1, 2010 (hereinafter 2010) each comprised 52 weeks.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing bank accounts, securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market value.
 
The Company maintains cash in bank accounts in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe that significant credit risk exists as a result of this practice.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are recorded at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific collection concerns exist, a reserve is established to reduce the amount recorded to an amount the Company believes will be collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable for each business unit. Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company typically does not require collateral on its accounts receivable.
 
Inventories
 
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or market. Management’s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs. Inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. The Company also considers current forecast plans, as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels. Though the Company considers these reserve balances to be adequate, changes in economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.

Property improvements


5-20 years



Buildings and improvements


20-40 years



Furniture, fixtures and equipment


3-10 years





Upon retirement or disposition, cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.

Goodwill
 
The Company applies a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis as of the last day of the eleventh month of the Company’s fiscal year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.  The operating segments of the Company also represent the reporting units for goodwill purposes.
 
The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step process.  The first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting units.  Estimated fair value is based on management judgments and assumptions and the Company cannot predict what future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of its goodwill.  The fair values as determined by management are compared with the aggregate carrying values of the reporting units.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment.  If the reporting unit carrying amount is greater than the fair value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
 
 


  


F-10





  


 
The second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill which is compared to its carrying value.  If the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.
 
The results of the impairment tests performed in 2012 and 2011 indicated no impairment to the Company’s goodwill. Due to the uncertainty of future events, the Company cannot assure that growth rates will not be lower than expected, discount rates will not increase or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units will not decline, all of which could impact the carrying value of remaining goodwill in future periods.
 
As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the Company’s Outdoor Equipment and Watercraft segments had no carrying amount of goodwill.  The changes in the carrying amount of those segments with goodwill and the composition of consolidated net goodwill for fiscal 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

Other Intangible Assets
 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company completed its annual fair value-based impairment test on indefinite-lived intangibles.  There was no impairment of intangibles recorded for the year ended September 28, 2012 or for the year ended September 30, 2011. 
 
Intangible assets with definite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 3 to 16 years.  Amortization of patents and other intangible assets with definite lives was $1,057, $729 and $681 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization of these definite-lived intangible assets is expected to be approximately $180 in 2013 and approximately $130 for each of the following four years.

During 2011, the allocation of the purchase price related to the LakeMaster® acquisition was completed resulting in indefinite-lived intangible assets of $290.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, and it performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists.  If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value.  During 2010, the Company recognized impairment on its Casarza-Ligure, Italy warehouse facility of $114 to write the asset down to its fair value of $656.  During 2011, the Company recognized impairment of $334 on part of its facility in Ferndale, Washington in order to write the asset down to its estimated fair value of $1,300.  In 2012, the Company recorded impairment on the Geonav trademark held by the Marine Electronics business, reducing its fair value to $0.
 
Warranties
 
The Company provides for warranties of certain products as they are sold. Warranty reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. Estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience, expectation of future conditions and known product issues.  The following table summarizes the warranty activity for the three years in the period ended September 28, 2012.

Earnings per Share (“EPS”)
 
Net income or loss per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is computed using the two-class method.  Grants of restricted stock which receive non-forfeitable dividends are required to be included as part of the basic weighted average share calculation under the two-class method.
 
Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cash dividends equal to 110% of all dividends declared and paid on each share of Class B common stock. The Company grants shares of unvested restricted stock in the form of Class A shares, which carry the same distribution rights as the Class A common stock described above.  As such, the undistributed earnings for each period are allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.

Basic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss allocated to Class A common stock and Class B common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding, respectively.  In periods with cumulative year to date net income and undistributed income, the undistributed income for each period is allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.  In periods where there is a cumulative year to date net loss or no undistributed income because distributions through dividends exceed net income, Class B shares are treated as anti-dilutive and, therefore, net losses are allocated equally on a per share basis among all participating securities.
 
For the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and October 1, 2010 basic income per share for Class A and Class B shares has been presented using the two class method as described above.


Diluted EPS
Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing allocated net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options and non-vested restricted stock. Anti-dilutive stock options and non-vested stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes that Class B common stock is converted into Class A common stock.  Therefore, diluted net income per share is the same for both Class A and Class B common shares.  In periods where the Company reports a net loss, the effect of anti-dilutive stock options and non-vested stock is excluded and diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share.
 
For the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and October 1, 2010, diluted net income per share reflects the effect of dilutive stock options and assumes the conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock.


Stock options that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future which were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been anti-dilutive totaled 5,850, 15,066 and 16,063 for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and October 1, 2010, respectively.  Non-vested stock that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future which were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been anti-dilutive totaled 495,235, 472,761 and 325,172 for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and October 1, 2010, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
 
Stock-based compensation cost is recorded for all option grants and awards of non-vested stock based on their grant-date fair value.  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. No stock options were granted in 2012, 2011 or 2010.  See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s stock-based incentive plans, including stock options, non-vested stock, and employee stock purchase plans.
 
Cash flows from income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards have been classified as financing cash flows.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company provides for income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between financial statement and taxable income.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred income tax asset will not be realized. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Employee Benefits
 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have various retirement and profit sharing plans. The Company does not have any significant foreign retirement plans. Pension obligations, which are generally based on compensation and years of service, are funded by payments to pension fund trustees. The Company’s policy is to annually fund the minimum amount required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for plans subject thereto. Other retirement costs are funded at least annually. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
 
Foreign Operations and Related Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The functional currencies of the Company’s foreign operations are the local currencies. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the end of the year. Results of operations are translated at monthly average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are classified as Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of Shareholders’ equity.
 
Currency gains and losses are recognized when assets and liabilities of foreign operations, denominated in other than their local currency, are converted into the local currency of the entity. Additionally, currency gains and losses are recognized through the settlement of transactions denominated in other than the local currency. The Company recognized currency gains from transactions of $92 in 2012 and currency losses of  $2,061 and $610 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, all of which were included in the “Other (income) expense, net” line of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Because the Company operates internationally, it has exposure to market risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 23% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended September 28, 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 12% were denominated in euros, with the remaining 11% denominated in various other foreign currencies.  The Company may mitigate a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the purchase of foreign currency swaps, forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments denominated in foreign currencies or borrowings in foreign currencies.  In 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the economic risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency borrowings.  The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria have been met:
 



 ●
 
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.  Contracts, internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.

 
 
 

●
 
All substantial risk of ownership transfers to the customer.  Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.

 
 
 

 ●
 
The fee is fixed or determinable.  This is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

 
 
 

 ●
 
Collectability is reasonably assured.  We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as by the customer’s payment history.


 
Estimated costs of returns and allowances and discounts are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized.
 
Advertising & Promotions
 
The Company expenses substantially all costs related to the production of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. Cooperative promotional arrangements are accrued as related revenue is earned.
 
Advertising and promotions expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $21,745, $22,338 and $20,107, respectively. These charges are included in Marketing and selling expenses.  Capitalized advertising costs, included in Other current assets, totaled $1,074 and $752 at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, and primarily included catalogs and costs of advertising which have not yet run for the first time.

Shipping and Handling Costs
 
Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in Net sales. Shipping and handling costs are included in Marketing and selling expenses and totaled $10,803, $10,591 and $ 9,697 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred except for costs of software development for new electronic products which are capitalized once technological feasibility is established and are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment. The gross amount capitalized related to software development was $14,762, less accumulated amortization of $6,626, at September 28, 2012 and $8,380, less accumulated amortization of $4,399, at September 30, 2011.  These costs are amortized over the expected life of the software of three years.  Amortization expense related to capitalized software in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $2,227, $1,373 and $489, respectively, and is included in Depreciation expense on Plant, Property and Equipment.
 
Fair Values
 
The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated fair value at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 due to the short maturities of these instruments. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company held foreign currency forward contracts and investments in equity and debt securities that were carried at fair value.  When indicators of impairment are present, the Company may be required to value certain long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment, and other intangibles at fair value.
 
Valuation Techniques
 
Over the Counter Derivative Contracts
 
The value of over the counter derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, are derived using pricing models, which take into account the contract terms, as well as other inputs, including, where applicable, the notional values of the contracts, payment terms, maturity dates, credit risk, interest rate yield curves, and contractual and market currency exchange rates.  The pricing model used for valuing interest rate swaps does not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets.
 
Rabbi Trust Assets
 
Rabbi trust assets, used to fund amounts the Company owes to certain officers and other employees under the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, are included in other assets, and are classified as trading securities.  These assets are comprised of marketable debt and equity securities that are marked to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company estimates the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates.  When estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss, if any.  In determining estimated future cash flows, the Company makes assumptions regarding anticipated financial position, future earnings and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets.
 
See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding the fair value of long-term debt and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding fair value measurement.
 
Reclassifications
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or earnings per share.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued updated authoritative guidance to amend fair value measurements and disclosures.  The guidance became effective for the Company on a prospective basis during its 2012 fiscal second quarter.  This guidance is intended to provide a consistent definition of fair value between International Financial Reporting Standards and U.S. GAAP and results in convergence of requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value.  The new guidance also changes some fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements related to activities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The Company adopted this updated authoritative guidance effective as of December 31, 2011, the beginning of its second quarter of fiscal 2012.  The Company’s adoption of this authoritative guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In July 2012, The FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The revised guidance will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under these amendments, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.  The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.  The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing goodwill for impairment.  The revised guidance allows an entity to make an initial qualitative evaluation, based on the entity’s events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  The results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the currently required two-step impairment test.  The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In December 2011, the FASB issued updated authoritative guidance to amend the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements.  The guidance becomes effective on a retroactive basis for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2013.  This new guidance allows companies the option to present other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.  It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.  Under both alternatives, companies will be required to present each component of net income and comprehensive income. The adoption of this updated authoritative guidance will impact the presentation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, but it will have no effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Term Loans
 
The Company’s term loans have a maturity date of September 29, 2029.  Each term loan requires monthly payments of principal and interest. Interest on the aggregate outstanding amount of the term loans is based on the prime rate plus an applicable margin.  The interest rate in effect on the term loans was 5.25% at September 28, 2012.
 
The term loans are guaranteed in part under the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development program and are secured with a first priority lien on land, buildings, machinery and equipment of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and a second priority lien on working capital and certain patents and trademarks of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Any proceeds from the sale of secured property are first applied against the related term loans and then against the Revolvers.
 
The aggregate term loan borrowings are subject to a pre-payment penalty.  The penalty is currently 8% of the pre-payment amount, and the penalty will decrease by 1% annually on the anniversary date of the effective date of the loan agreement.
 
Revolvers
 
On November 16, 2010, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into amendments to their Revolving Credit Agreements (or “Revolvers”).  The amended terms of the Revolvers, maturing on November 16, 2014, provide for funding of up to $75,000, with an accordion feature that allows the Company to have an option to increase the maximum seasonal financing availability subject to the approval of the lenders. Borrowing availability under the Revolvers is based on certain eligible working capital assets, primarily accounts receivable and inventory of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Revolvers contain a seasonal line reduction that reduces the maximum amount of borrowings during the period from mid-July to mid-November, consistent with the Company's reduced working capital needs throughout that period, and requires an annual seasonal pay down provision that reduces the borrowing capacity to $30,000 for 60 consecutive days.  The amendments to the Revolvers reset the interest rate calculation each quarter,  by instituting an applicable margin based on the Company’s leverage ratio for the trailing twelve month period.
 
The interest rate on the Revolvers is based on LIBOR or the prime rate, at the Company’s discretion, plus an applicable margin.  If the Company had such borrowings, the interest rate in effect on the Revolvers would have been approximately  2.50% at September 28, 2012.
 
The Revolvers are secured with a first priority lien on working capital assets and certain patents and trademarks of the Company and its subsidiaries and a second priority lien on land, buildings, machinery and equipment of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.  As cash collections related to secured assets are applied against the balance outstanding under the Revolvers, the liability is classified as current.  The Company’s remaining borrowing availability under the Revolvers was approximately $28,100 at September 28, 2012.
 
Under the terms of the Revolvers, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants.  Among other restrictions, the Company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and make acquisitions or divestitures above certain amounts.  The key financial covenants include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, limits on minimum net worth and EBITDA, a limit on capital expenditures, and, as noted above, a seasonal pay-down requirement.

 
Other Borrowings
 
The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of September 28, 2012.  The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers’ compensation insurance which totaled $1,401 and $2,103 at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively.  The Company has no unsecured lines of credit as of September 28, 2012 or September 30, 2011.

The weighted average borrowing rate for short-term debt was approximately 2.6%, 3.4% and 5.3% for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 was approximately $8,860 and $14,972, respectively.
 
Certain of the Company’s loan agreements require that the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, members of her family and related entities (hereinafter the Johnson Family) continue to own stock having votes sufficient to elect a majority of the directors. At November 30, 2012, the Johnson Family held 3,775,826 shares or approximately 44% of the Class A common stock, 1,211,196 shares or approximately 100% of the Class B common stock and approximately 77% of the voting power of both classes of common stock taken as a whole.
 
3         DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
 
The following disclosures describe the Company’s objectives in using derivative instruments, the business purpose or context for using derivative instruments, and how the Company believes the use of derivative instruments helps achieve the stated objectives.  In addition, the following disclosures describe the effects of the Company’s use of derivative instruments and hedging activities on its financial statements.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 23% of the Company’s revenues for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Approximately 12% were denominated in euros, with the remaining 11% denominated in various other foreign currencies.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.
 
The Company mitigates a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Foreign currency forward contracts enable the Company to lock in the foreign currency exchange rate for a fixed amount of currency to be paid or received on a specified date in the future. The Company uses such foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on financial instruments and known commitments denominated in foreign currencies. None of the Company’s derivative financial instruments have been designated as hedging instruments.
 
As of September 28, 2012, the Company held one foreign currency forward contract with a notional value of 4,400 Swiss francs.  See “Note 4 – Fair Value Measurements” for information regarding the fair value and financial statement presentation of this derivative.
 
 


  


F-19





  


 
Interest Rate Risk
 
The Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company’s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts receivable are collected and cash is accumulated or debt is repaid.  The Company’s goal in managing its interest rate risk is to maintain a mix of floating rate and fixed rate debt such that permanent non-equity capital needs are largely funded with long term fixed rate debt and seasonal working capital needs are funded with short term floating rate debt.


When the appropriate mix of fixed rate or floating rate debt cannot be directly obtained in a cost effective manner, the Company may enter into interest rate swap contracts in order to change floating rate interest into fixed rate interest or vice versa for a specific amount of debt in order to achieve the desired proportions of floating rate and fixed rate debt.  An interest rate swap is a contract in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.  The notional amount is the equivalent amount of debt that the Company wishes to change from a fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate or vice versa and is the basis for calculating the related interest payments required under the interest rate swap contract.


As of September 28, 2012, the Company had approximately $138 of unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) related to a formerly effective interest rate swap that had subsequently become ineffective on January 2, 2009. The Company expects that the amount remaining in AOCI will be amortized into interest expense by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2013.


The Company held no interest rate swap contracts in 2012 or 2011.  As of September 28, 2012, the Company was unhedged with respect to interest rate risk on its floating rate debt.

 
The following discloses the location of loss reclassified from AOCI into net income related to derivative instruments during the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011, and October 1, 2010:

4         FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
 
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy has been established based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable.
 



 ●
 
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.

 
 
 

 ●
 
Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments.

 
 
 

 ●
 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Rabbi trust assets are classified as trading securities and are comprised of marketable debt and equity securities that are marked to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.  The rabbi trust assets are used to fund amounts the Company owes to certain officers and other employees under the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  The mark-to-market adjustments are recorded in “Other (income) expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contract reported above was measured using the market value approach based on foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the forward contract. The mark-to-market adjustments are recorded in “Other (income) expense, net.”

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition.
 
During 2012, the Company recorded impairment on a trademark held by the Marine Electronics business, reducing its fair value to $0.  A $609 charge was included in “Administrative management, finance and information systems” expenses in the Marine Electronics segment related to this impairment during 2012.
 
During 2011, the Company recognized impairment of $334 on part of its facility in Ferndale, Washington in order to write the asset down to its estimated fair value of approximately $1,300.  The fair value of the facility was determined using a market approach based on recent selling prices of comparable properties. The impairment charge was included in “Other (income) expense, net” in the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Watercraft segment.  This facility was sold in 2012 for approximately its fair value.
 
During 2010, the Company recognized impairment related to a warehouse facility in Casarza-Ligure, Italy of $114 to write the asset down to its fair value of $656.  The fair value of the facility was determined using a market approach based on recent selling prices of comparable properties.  The impairment charge was included in “Administrative management, finance and information systems” expenses in the Diving segment.  This facility was sold in March 2010 for $634.

The Company has tax credit carryforwards comprised of foreign tax credits, research and development and other state credits that begin to expire in 2020.
 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company considers at each reporting period all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  The determination of the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is dependent upon management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.  Positive evidence includes the probability of achieving forecasted future taxable income, applicable tax strategies and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions.  Negative evidence includes the Company’s cumulative losses and expiring tax carryforwards.  
 
The change in the valuation allowance in 2012 provided a negative impact of $1,410 to the effective tax expense.  The amount was primarily the result of increases in foreign valuation allowances of $1,787, which were partially offset by U.S. usage of tax attributes totaling $377.  In fiscal 2012, the Company established a valuation allowance of $173 against the net deferred tax assets in the New Zealand tax jurisdiction based on a cumulative earnings deficit.  Additional operating losses in France, Japan, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom also increased the valuation allowance by $1,614 in fiscal 2012.
 
At September 30, 2011, the Company’s federal and state deferred tax assets were comprised of future tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards and future deductions and credits and, prior to a valuation allowance, totaled $34,814. Based upon future projections and the fact that the Company’s U.S. operations generated cumulative profits over the three year period ended September 30, 2011, the Company believed it would generate sufficient taxable income before most tax assets will expire.  It therefore concluded during fiscal 2011 that a valuation allowance was no longer required for the majority of the federal deferred tax assets.
 
The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2011, due to usage during the year and the year-end reversal, provided a benefit of $25,305 to the Company’s effective tax expense.  This was partially offset by the increase in foreign valuation allowances of $2,419.  In fiscal 2011 the Company established a valuation allowance of $903 against the net deferred tax assets in French tax jurisdictions based upon a cumulative earnings deficit.  Additional operating losses in Japan, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom also increased the valuation allowance by $1,516 in fiscal 2011.
 
In 2010, the valuation allowance positive impact of $744 to the effective tax expense was primarily the result of the U.S. usage of tax benefits related to net operating losses and the corresponding reversal of valuation allowances of $2,539, which were partially offset by the increase in foreign valuation allowances of $1,795.  In fiscal 2010 the Company established a valuation allowance of $1,020 against the net deferred tax assets in an Italian tax jurisdiction based on a cumulative earnings deficit and eliminated the valuation allowance of $75 against the net deferred tax assets in the New Zealand tax jurisdiction based on positive cumulative earnings.  Continual net operating losses in Japan, Spain and United Kingdom also increased the valuation allowance by $810.
 
Taxes paid were $3,163, $878 and $835 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The decrease in deferred tax assets due to utilization of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards was $5,260, $3,135 and $3,098 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Unrecognized tax benefits are included in accrued taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
In accordance with its accounting policy, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The total accrued interest with respect to income taxes was approximately $361 and $248 for the years ended September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively.  Interest of $113, $39 and $86 was recorded as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The Company is currently undergoing examination in the Netherlands and Italy.  There was a change in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of a tax audit in Italy in the year ended September 28, 2012 and in Germany in the year ended September 30, 2011.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions.  However, it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit prior to the statute expiring or one of the above audits may adjust the Company’s tax filings.  At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.
 
The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The following tax years remain subject to examination by the respective major tax jurisdictions:

Federal and state income taxes are provided on foreign subsidiary income distributed to, or taxable in, the U.S. during the year.  In 2010, the Company reversed $2,900 of U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of its Canadian subsidiary considered not permanently reinvested as a result of attributed dividend repatriation. As of September 28, 2012, net undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $113,031. The Company considers these unremitted earnings to be permanently invested abroad and no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made on these amounts. In the future, if foreign earnings are returned to the U.S., additional tax may result, although the calculation of such additional taxes is not practical at this time.  As of September 28, 2012, the Company held approximately $46,400 of cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts in foreign taxing jurisdictions.

7         EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
The Company has non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. employees. Retirement benefits are generally provided based on employees’ years of service and average earnings. Normal retirement age is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement.  The Company elected to freeze its U.S. defined benefit pension plans as of September 30, 2009 and as a result, there are no benefit accruals related to service performed after that date.

The Company expects to recognize $628 of unrecognized loss amortization as a component of net periodic benefit cost in 2013.  This amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 28, 2012.
 
At September 28, 2012, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $25,516 and $13,673, respectively, and there were no plans with plan assets in excess of benefit obligations. At September 30, 2011, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $21,032 and $11,304, respectively, and there were no plans with plan assets in excess of benefit obligations.
 
The Company anticipates making contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of $1,140 through September 27, 2013.
 
Estimated benefit payments from the defined benefit plans to participants for the five years ending September 29, 2017 and five years thereafter are as follows:

The impact of the change in discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately $3,617, $747 and $705 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remainder of the actuarial losses for each year results from adjustments to mortality tables, other modifications to actuarial assumptions and investment returns in excess of, or less than, estimates.
 
To determine the discount rate assumption used in the Company’s pension valuation, the Company identified a benefit payout stream based on the demographics of the pension plans and constructed a hypothetical bond portfolio using high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows that matched that benefit payout stream.  A yield curve was calculated based on this hypothetical portfolio which was used for the discount rate determination.
 
 


  


F-28





  


 
The Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets by using the historical asset returns for various investment asset classes and adjusting them to reflect future expectations.  The expected asset class returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations, resulting in a weighted average return which is rounded to the nearest quarter percent.
 
The Company uses measurement dates of October 1 to determine pension expenses for each year and the last day of the fiscal year to determine the fair value of the pension assets.
 
The Company’s pension plans’ weighted average asset allocations at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, by asset category were as follows:

The Company’s primary investment objective for the plans’ assets is to maximize the probability of meeting the plans’ actuarial target rate of return of 7.5%, with a secondary goal of returning 4% above the rate of inflation. These return objectives are targeted while simultaneously striving to minimize risk of loss to the plans’ assets. The investment horizon over which the investment objectives are expected to be met is a full market cycle or five years, whichever is greater.


The Company’s investment strategy for the plans is to invest in a diversified portfolio that will generate average long-term returns commensurate with the aforementioned objectives while minimizing risk.

The fair values of the money market fund and mutual fund were derived from quoted market prices as substantially all of these instruments have active markets.  The fair value of the group annuity contract was derived using a discounted cash flow model with inputs based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations.  The asset allocation of the mutual fund is a U.S. large-cap blend based on a moderate allocation style, generally investing approximately 70% to 75% in equity securities and the remainder in fixed income securities.  The annuity contract consists of high quality bonds.
 
The Company also has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides certain officers and employees the ability to defer a portion of their compensation until a later date.  The deferred amounts and earnings thereon are payable to participants, or designated beneficiaries, at specified future dates upon retirement, death or termination of employment from the Company.  The deferred compensation liability, which is classified as other liabilities on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was approximately $7,310 and $5,405 as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively.
 
A majority of the Company’s full-time employees are covered by defined contribution programs. Expense attributable to the defined contribution programs was approximately $882, $853 and $826 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to elect 25% of the members of the Company’s Board of Directors and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to elect the remaining directors. With respect to matters other than the election of directors or any matters for which class voting is required by law, holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. If any dividends (other than dividends paid in shares of the Company’s stock) are paid by the Company on its common stock, a dividend would be paid on each share of Class A common stock equal to 110% of the amount paid on each share of Class B common stock. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into one share of Class A common stock. During 2012 and 2011 there were 84 and 622 shares of Class B common stock converted into Class A common stock, respectively. There were no shares of Class A common stock converted into Class B common stock.
 
10       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

(1) Long term assets consist of net property, plant and equipment, net intangible assets, goodwill and other assets excluding deferred income taxes.
 
The Company had no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of its net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.
 
13        LITIGATION
 
The Company is subject to various legal actions and proceedings in the normal course of business, including those related to commercial disputes, product liability, intellectual property and environmental matters. The Company is insured against loss for certain of these matters. Although litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate exposure with respect to these matters cannot be ascertained, management does not believe the final outcome of any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company.
 
On March 1, 2012, the company received a $3,500 settlement payment resolving an ongoing claim with its insurance carriers.  As part of the settlement, the Company’s former lawsuit filed in the U.S. District for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against its insurers was dismissed.  The Company originally initiated legal proceedings in May 2005 to seek coverage from its insurers related to an intellectual property dispute between the Company and one of its competitors, which was later settled.
 
The Company considers the defense of its intellectual property assets to be an ordinary and necessary operating activity essential to maintaining its competitive advantages.  Such activities are not of a financing nature and are not unusual or infrequent.  As a result, and in accordance with the presentation guidance in the Income Statement Subtopics in ASC 225, the Company recognized all of the litigation costs incurred and the payment of the settlement in relation to this matter as a component of operating expenses.  Accordingly, the $3,500 insurance recovery related to these costs was also recognized in operations as a matter of consistency.  This litigation settlement recovery was included in the Watercraft segment.

14        SIGNIFICANT EVENT
 
On September 12, 2011, the Company announced a temporary closure of its Binghamton, New York manufacturing facility and administrative offices due to flooding from torrential rains.  The Binghamton manufacturing facility houses the Company’s consumer, commercial and military tent businesses.  The Company’s finished goods warehouse located nearby was unaffected by the flooding and the Company was able to resume shipments of products within a few days.  Production resumed on September 28, 2011.
 
The Company maintains insurance for both property damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic events.  Business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred.  Non-refundable insurance recoveries received in excess of the net book value of damaged assets, clean up and post-event costs are recognized as income in the period received.
 
The Company has incurred costs related to the clean-up and repair of the facility and equipment, losses of inventory and fixed assets, rental of temporary office space for administrative and R&D personnel and payroll expenses for labor idled due to the flood totaling approximately $1,578 in 2012 and $1,868 in 2011.  In 2012 and 2011, the Company received $2,000 and $1,000, respectively, of insurance reimbursements associated with these costs and has recorded a receivable with its insurers of $636 as of September 28, 2012.  The Company recognized expense of $19 and $257 in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and in 2012 recorded a gain of $220 related to insurance recoveries under its business interruption coverage and a gain of $246 related to insurance proceeds received to replace fixed assets under the Company’s property loss coverage.  These amounts are included in “Administrative management, finance and information systems” expense in the Outdoor Equipment segment.
 
The Company is negotiating additional insurance recoveries under its business continuation and fixed asset replacement coverages.  The amount of these recoveries, if any, cannot be estimated at September 28, 2012.  Any additional recoveries will be recorded as income upon the resolution of gain contingencies.
 
15        RESTRUCTURING
 
On July 11, 2012, the Company announced plans to restructure Watercraft sales and distribution in Europe and to consolidate all of its U.S. operations at a single location in Old Town, Maine. The Company believes this plan will enhance the competitiveness and profit potential of its Watercraft business.  This action will result in the closure of a sales office in the U.K., the closure of a marketing and R&D facility in Bellingham, Washington and the elimination of approximately 24 positions in the U.S. and Europe.  These charges are included in the “Administrative management, finance and information systems” line in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Watercraft segment.  The restructuring accrual is included in the “Other current liabilities” line in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  In addition, the Company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by $450 as a result of this action. The Company expects the total cost of this restructuring to be approximately $2,400 and to be completed over the next 12 months.

18       ACQUISITION
 
On July 11, 2011, the Company purchased the assets of Waypoint Technologies Inc. (“Waypoint”) and Pro Map Technologies Inc. for cash of approximately $4,000.  Waypoint is the maker of LakeMaster® brand high definition electronic lake charts, the premier brand of lake charts for anglers in the Northern United States. The purchase was funded with existing cash and credit facilities.  The Company believes the purchase, combined with the Company’s existing marine electronics products, will present new and innovative opportunities to enhance the fishing experience.  The Waypoint purchase is included in the Company’s Marine Electronics segment.
 
As part of the acquisitions, the Company acquired a bathymetry database valued at $2,000 which was included in property, plant and equipment.  The Company recognized goodwill of $732 as a result of the acquisition related to expected synergies with the Company’s existing Marine Electronics businesses.  The goodwill acquired as a part of this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired business’ operations since the date of acquisition.  The Company has not presented pro forma financial information with respect to the acquisition due to the immateriality of the transaction.

19        SUBSEQUENT EVENT
 
On November 14, 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Jetboil, Inc. (“Jetboil”).  Jetboil, founded and based in Manchester, New Hampshire, designs and manufactures the world’s top brand of portable outdoor cooking systems.  The approximately $16,000 acquisition was funded with existing cash and credit facilities.  The Company believes that sales of Jetboil’s innovative cooking products can be expanded through the Company’s global marketing and distribution network and both companies will benefit from an increased presence in the outdoor Specialty trade channel.  The Jetboil acquisition will be included in the Company’s Outdoor Equipment segment.
 
Due to the difference in fiscal year end periods between the Company and Jetboil and the timing of certain significant year end accounting procedures to be performed at Jetboil, it is impractical to present full year pro-forma results of the combined entities.  Unaudited revenues for Jetboil for the ten months ended October 31, 2012 were approximately $11,500.
 
The Company is currently in the process of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in this business combination.  Any potential goodwill resulting from this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  Transaction costs are not estimated to be material.
 
The amounts of net sales and operating profit for Jetboil for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the latest periods for which full year results are available, were as follows:
