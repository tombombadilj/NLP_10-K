PART I 
ITEM 1.
BUSINESS.
Ross Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (we or the Company) operate two brands of off-price retail
apparel and home fashion
stores. At January 28, 2012, we operated
a total of 1,125 stores, of which 1,037 were Ross Dress for Less®
(Ross) locations in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 88 were
dds DISCOUNTS® stores in seven states. Both brands target
value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54. Ross target
customers are primarily from middle income households, while dds DISCOUNTS
target customers are typically from more moderate income households. The
decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations
of our stores, are based on these customer profiles.
Ross offers first-quality,
in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home
fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department
and specialty store regular prices. dds DISCOUNTS features a more
moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel,
accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at everyday
savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices.
We believe that both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS derive a competitive advantage by
offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories
in organized and easy-to-shop store environments. 
Our mission is to offer
competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key
strategic objectives: 

Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable
  brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the
  store. 
Meet customer needs on a local
  basis. 
Deliver an in-store shopping experience that
  reflects the expectations of the off-price customer. 
Manage real estate growth to compete effectively
  across all our markets. 
We refer to our fiscal years ended
January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010 as fiscal 2011, fiscal
2010, and fiscal 2009, respectively. 
Merchandising, Purchasing, and
Pricing 
We seek to provide our customers
with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer
apparel, accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at
everyday savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular
prices at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store
regular prices at dds DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise
that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is
received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS
stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis,
enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the
market. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which
emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a treasure-hunt shopping
experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad
assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home.
Merchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of
off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and
past-season merchandise for both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally
recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an
important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand name label on
the merchandise we sell.
3


We have established merchandise
assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we
offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we
generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with
a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within
each size or item. The mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal
2011 was approximately as follows: Ladies 29%, Home Accents and Bed and Bath
25%, Men's 13%, Accessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances 13%, Shoes
12%, and Childrens 8%. Our merchandise offerings also include small furniture
and furniture accents, educational toys and games, luggage, gourmet food and
cookware, watches, and sporting goods.
Purchasing. We have a combined network of approximately 7,800
merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS and
believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our
requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from
manufacturers, and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining
sufficient merchandise inventory. 
We believe that our ability to
effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our
success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our
customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts
relative to department and specialty stores for Ross and moderate department and
discount stores for dds DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise
buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to
take advantage of imbalances between retailers demand for products and
manufacturers supply of those products. 
Unlike most department and
specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide
promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split
shipments, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For
most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers.
These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant
discounts on in-season purchases. 
The majority of the apparel and
apparel-related merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired
through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled
orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as
"close-out" and "packaway" purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores
in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our stores at lower prices.
Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our
warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same
selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method
of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive
savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly
fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion
trends.
In fiscal 2011, we continued our
emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling
opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately
49% and 47% of total inventories as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 and
reflects our merchants continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of
close-out opportunities in the marketplace. We believe the strong discounts we
are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our
business results. 
Our buying offices are primarily located in
New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest apparel markets. These
strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis,
sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers.
These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships-a key
element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.
4


Over the past year, we continued
to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further enhance
our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers. At the end of
fiscal 2011, we had a total of approximately 510 merchants for Ross and dds
DISCOUNTS combined, up from 450 in the prior year. The Ross and dds DISCOUNTS
buying organizations are separate and distinct. These buying resources include
merchandise management, buyers, and assistant buyers. Ross and dds DISCOUNTS
buyers have on average, 10 years of experience, including merchandising
positions with other retailers such as Bloomingdale's, Burlington Coat Factory,
Foot Locker, HomeGoods, Kohls, Loehmanns, Lord & Taylor, Macy's,
Marshalls, Nordstrom, Saks, and T.J. Maxx. We expect to continue to make
additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our
relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing
objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and
fashions at competitive discounts. 
The off-price buying strategies
utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross
merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and
specialty stores, and to purchase dds DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that
are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.

Pricing. Our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at Ross
that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular
prices. At dds DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions
that are priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store
regular prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our
selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in
department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate
department and discount stores for dds DISCOUNTS merchandise. 
Our pricing strategy at Ross
differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our
merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty
store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices. On a
weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible
markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to
promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of
fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dds DISCOUNTS where
prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.

Stores 
At January 28, 2012, we operated a
total of 1,125 stores comprised of 1,037 Ross stores and 88 dds DISCOUNTS stores.
Our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping
centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the
market and real estate opportunities permit, we cluster Ross stores to benefit from
economies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field
management. We do the same for dds DISCOUNTS stores.
We believe a key element of our
success is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments at
both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS, which allow customers to shop at their own pace.
While our stores promote a self-service, treasure hunt shopping experience, the
layouts are designed to promote customer convenience in their merchandise
presentation, dressing rooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our
store's sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack
aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just
below the ceiling of each department. We enable our customers to select among
sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers. At most stores,
shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash
registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient
staffing. 
5


We use point-of-sale (POS)
hardware and software systems in all stores, which minimizes transaction time
for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket
at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks, debit, credit, and electronic gift cards in a
matter of seconds. For Ross and dds DISCOUNTS combined,
approximately 60% and 58% of payments in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010,
respectively, were made with credit cards and debit cards. We provide cash,
credit card, and debit card refunds on all merchandise (not used, worn, or
altered) returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a
receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit.

Operating Costs 
Consistent with the other aspects
of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible.
Among the factors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are
generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to a store
design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of
labor saving technologies; economies of scale with respect to general and
administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and
purchasing decisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate
conversion of existing buildings to our formats. 
Information
Systems 
We continue to invest in new
information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the
next several years. 
Recent initiatives include
enhancements to our Merchandise Planning, Core Merchandising, and Allocation
systems. These initiatives support our entry into new markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement, while
also supporting future growth. In addition, we made
improvements to our networks and our point-of-sale
systems to increase reliability and speed and are also upgrading our store wireless
network. 
Distribution 
We have four distribution
processing facilities-two in California, one in Pennsylvania, and one in South
Carolina. We ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these
distribution centers, which are large, highly automated, and built to suit our
specific off-price business model. 
In addition, we own two and lease
three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage. We use other third-party
facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory.
We also utilize third-party cross
docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are
made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week
depending on location.
We believe that our distribution
centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate
processing capacity to support store growth in 2012. Information on the size and
locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under
Properties in Item 2. 
Advertising 
We rely primarily on television
advertising to communicate the Ross value proposition-brand name merchandise at
everyday low prices. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the
most efficient and cost-effective medium for communicating everyday savings on a
wide selection of brand name bargains for both the family and home. Advertising
for dds DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local
grass roots initiatives. 
6


Trademarks 
The trademarks for Ross Dress For
Less® and dds DISCOUNTS® have been registered with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Employees 
As of January 28, 2012, we had
approximately 53,900 total employees, including an estimated 39,000 part-time
employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees-especially during the peak
seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship
between the Company and our employees to be good. 
Competition 
We believe the principal
competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry
are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise, offering a
well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and consistently
providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute
this concept, we continue to make strategic investments in our buying
organization. We also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising
system to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product based on
more local versus regional trends. We believe that we are well positioned to
compete on the basis of each of these factors. 
Nevertheless, the retail apparel
market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic
and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from
department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other
off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are
units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater
resources. We also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and
home fashions through catalogs or over the internet. The retail apparel and
home-related businesses may become even more competitive in the future.

dds DISCOUNTS 
At January 28, 2012, we operated
88 dds DISCOUNTS in seven states: 48 in California, 19 in Texas, 12 in Florida,
four in Arizona, two in Georgia, two in Nevada, and one in Maryland. At January
29, 2011, we had 40 dds DISCOUNTS stores in California, 14 in Texas, seven in
Florida, and two each in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, for a total of 67 stores.
dds DISCOUNTS targets the needs of households with more moderate
incomes than Ross customers. We believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic
markets in the country. dds DISCOUNTS features a moderately-priced assortment
of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home
fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount
store regular prices.
The dds DISCOUNTS business
generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of Ross,
but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points. The
typical dds DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a
densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood. The merchant, store, and
distribution organizations for dds DISCOUNTS and Ross are separate and
distinct; however, dds DISCOUNTS shares certain other corporate and support
services with Ross.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2011, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports, and other investor communications, including
those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with
respect to anticipated future events and our projected financial performance,
operations, and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
forward-looking statements and our prior expectations and projections. Refer to
Managements Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and
discussion of Forward-Looking Statements. 
Our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be
adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that
apply to both Ross and dds DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the
following: 
We are subject to the economic
and industry risks that affect large retailers operating in the United States.

Our business is exposed to the
risks of a large, multi-store retailer, which must continually and efficiently
obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and
growing network of stores. These risk factors include: 

An increase in the level of competitive pressures
  in the apparel or home-related merchandise industry. 
Changes in the level of consumer spending on or
  preferences for apparel or home-related merchandise. 
The impact from the macro-economic environment and
  financial and credit markets including but not limited to interest rates,
  recession, inflation, deflation, energy costs, tax rates and policy,
  unemployment trends, and fluctuating commodity costs. 
Changes in geopolitical and geoeconomic
  conditions. 
Unseasonable weather trends that could affect
  consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparel-related
  products. 
A change in the availability, quantity, or quality
  of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts that could impact
  our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide
  assortment of merchandise at competitive prices. 
Potential disruptions in the supply chain that
  could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and
  cost-effective manner. 
A change in the availability, quality, or cost of
  new store real estate locations. 
A downturn in the economy or a natural disaster in
  California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores or a
  distribution center. Our corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office,
  two distribution centers, one warehouse, and 26% of our stores are located in
  California.
We are subject to operating
risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies.

The continued success of our
business depends, in part, upon our ability to increase sales at our existing
store locations, to open new stores, and to operate stores on a profitable
basis. Our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a
continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth. In executing our
off-price retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies, expand our
store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks,
including: 
8



Our ability to attract and retain personnel with
  the retail talent necessary to execute our strategies. 
Our ability to effectively operate our various
  supply chain, core merchandising, and other information
  systems. 
Our ability to improve our merchandising
  capabilities through implementation of new processes and systems
  enhancements. 
Our ability to improve new store sales and
  profitability, especially in newer regions and markets. 
Our ability to achieve and maintain targeted
  levels of productivity and efficiency in our distribution
  centers. 
Our ability to lease or acquire acceptable new
  store sites with favorable demographics and long-term financial
  returns. 
Our ability to identify and to successfully enter
  new geographic markets. 
Our ability to achieve planned gross margins by
  effectively managing inventories, markdowns, and shrink. 
Our ability to effectively manage all operating
  costs of the business, the largest of which are payroll and benefit costs for
  store and distribution center employees.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

At January 28, 2012, we operated a
total of 1,125 stores, of which 1,037 were Ross locations in 29 states, the
District of Columbia, and Guam, and 88 were dds DISCOUNTS stores in seven
states. All stores are leased, with the exception of three locations which we
own. 
During fiscal 2011, we opened 59
new Ross stores and closed ten existing stores. The average approximate Ross
store size is 29,600 square feet.
During fiscal 2011, we opened 21
new dds DISCOUNTS stores. The average approximate dds DISCOUNTS store size is
23,900 square feet.
During fiscal 2011, no one store
accounted for more than 1% of our sales.
We carry earthquake insurance to
help mitigate the risk of financial loss due to an earthquake. 
Our real estate strategy in 2012
is to open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market
penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of
sales in each market. We also expect to continue our expansion of Ross and dds
DISCOUNTS into new markets and states in 2012. Important considerations in
evaluating a new store location in both new and existing markets are the
availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics,
competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we
continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.

Where possible, we obtain sites in
buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new
locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given
market. At January 28, 2012, the majority of our stores had unexpired original
lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options
of five years each. The average unexpired original lease term of our leased
stores is five years or 22 years if renewal options are included. See Note E of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

California which was previously leased, and we acquired the land and buildings
for our future corporate headquarters in Dublin, California, for a combined
total of approximately $100 million.

See additional discussion under
Distribution in Item 1. 
ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS. 
Like many California retailers, we
have been named in class action lawsuits regarding wage and hour claims. Class
action litigation involving allegations that hourly associates have missed meal
and/or rest break periods, as well as allegations of unpaid overtime wages to
store managers and assistant store managers at Company stores under state law
remains pending as of January 28, 2012. 
We are also party to various other
legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed
against us include commercial, product, customer, intellectual property, and
labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which plaintiffs
allege that we violated state or federal laws. Actions against us are in various
procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and
are subject to uncertainties.
We believe that the resolution of
our pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.

Stockholder Return Performance
Graph 
The following information in this
Item 5 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing
under the Securities Act of 1933.
Total stockholder returns for our
common stock outperformed the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Index and
the S&P Retailing Group over the last five years as set forth in the graph
below. The five year period comparison graph assumes that the value of the
investment in our common stock at each fiscal year end and the comparative
indexes was $100 on January 31, 2007 and measures the performance of this
investment as of the last trading day in the month of January for each of the
following five years. These measurement dates are based on the historical
month-end data available and may vary slightly from our actual fiscal year-end
date for each period. Data with respect to returns for the S&P indexes is
not readily available for periods shorter than one month. The total return
assumes the reinvestment of dividends at the frequency with which dividends are
paid. The graph is a historical representation of past performance only and is
not necessarily indicative of future returns to stockholders.

ITEM 7.  
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
      AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Overview 
Ross Stores, Inc. operates two
off-price retail chains  Ross Dress for Less® (Ross) and dds
DISCOUNTS®. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion
chain in the United States with 1,037 locations in 29 states, the District of
Columbia, and Guam. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and
designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions for the entire family
at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular
prices. We also operate 88 dds DISCOUNTS locations in seven states that feature
a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand
apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at
everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store
regular prices.
Our primary objective is to pursue
and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain or improve
profitability and improve financial returns over the long term. In establishing
appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share
trends for the off-price industry. Total aggregate sales for the five largest
off-price retailers in the United States increased 6% during 2011 on top of an
8% increase in 2010. The 6% off-price growth in 2011 compares favorably to total
national apparel sales which increased 4%, according to data published by the
NPD Group, Inc., a leading provider of comprehensive consumer and retail
information worldwide.
We believe that the stronger
relative sales gains of the off-price retailers during 2011 and 2010 were driven
mainly by an increased focus on value by consumers over the past few years. Our
sales and earnings gains in 2011 continued to benefit from efficient execution
of our off-price model throughout all areas of our business. Our merchandise and
operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market
share of  the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name
brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday
discounts.
Looking ahead to 2012, we are
planning further reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing
to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to
help maximize our profitability. 
We refer to our fiscal years ended
January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010 as fiscal 2011, fiscal
2010, and fiscal 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 each had 52
weeks.

Stores. Total stores open at the end of
fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were  1,125, 1,055, and 1,005, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal  2011,
2010, and 2009 increased by 7%, 5%, and 5% from the respective prior  years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional
stores based on market  penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store  profitability, and the
ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually  evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for
potential  new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine  store closures based on similar
criteria.

Sales. Sales for fiscal 2011 increased $742.2 million, or 9.4%,
compared to the prior year due to the opening of 70 net new stores during 2011,
and a 5% increase in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have
been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2010 increased
$681.9 million, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 50 net
new stores during 2010, and a 5% increase in sales from comparable
stores.

We intend to address the
competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and
refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our
organization, to diversify our merchandise mix, and to more fully develop our
organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings.
Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains
in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we cannot be sure that they will result in a
continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings. 
Cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2011
increased $511.0 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased
sales from the opening of 70 net new stores during the year, and a 5% increase
in sales from comparable stores.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased approximately 35 basis points from the prior
year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 50 basis point increase in
merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower
shortage. In addition, occupancy leveraged 20 basis points. These improvements
were partially offset by increases in freight costs of about 20 basis points,
distribution expenses of about 10 basis points, and buying costs of about five
basis points. 
Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2010
increased $402.5 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased
sales from the opening of 50 net new stores during the year, and a 5% increase
in sales from comparable stores.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased approximately 130 basis points from the prior
year. This improvement was mainly the result of an 80 basis point increase in
merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower
shortage. In addition, occupancy leveraged 30 basis points, and distribution
costs declined by about 30 basis points. These improvements were partially
offset by an increase in freight costs of about 10 basis points. 
We cannot be sure that the gross
profit margins realized in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 will continue in future
years. 
Selling, general and
administrative expenses. For fiscal
2011, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $74.3
million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating
costs reflecting the opening of 70 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a
percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased by approximately 50 basis points
compared to the prior year due equally to a combination of leverage on both
general and administrative and store operating expenses. 
For fiscal 2010, SG&A
increased $99.0 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased
store operating costs reflecting the opening of 50 net new stores during the
year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased by
approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year mainly driven by
leverage on store operating expenses. 
The largest component of SG&A
is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as
of fiscal year end 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately 53,900, 49,500, and
45,600, respectively. 
21


Interest expense (income),
net. In fiscal 2011, interest expense
increased by $0.3 million primarily due to issuance costs for our revolving
credit facility, while interest income decreased by $0.4 million primarily due to lower
investment yields as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, net
interest expense in fiscal 2011 remained flat compared to the prior year. The
table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009:

Taxes on earnings.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011,
2010, and 2009 was approximately 38% in each year, which represents the
applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal
benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is
impacted by changes in laws, location of new stores, level of earnings, and the
resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. We anticipate that
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 will be about 38%. 
Net earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011
were higher compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to both lower cost of goods
sold and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Net earnings as a
percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 were higher compared to fiscal 2009
primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales.
Earnings per share.
Diluted earnings per share in fiscal
2011 was $2.86, compared to $2.31 in fiscal 2010. This 24% increase in diluted
earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 18% increase in net
earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding,
largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase
program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was $2.31, compared to $1.77
in fiscal 2009. This 31% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable
to an approximate 25% increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted
average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common
stock under our stock repurchase program.
Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of funds for
our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade
credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory
purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, capital expenditures in connection with opening
new stores, and investments in distribution centers and information systems. We
also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay
dividends.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $820.1 million, $673.0 million, and $888.4 million in fiscal
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The primary sources of cash provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were net earnings excluding
non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. Our primary source of
operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly
review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current
merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and
liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns.

Net cash from operations increased
in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher net earnings and lower working
capital used to purchase additional packaway inventory. We expect to continue to
take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to deliver bargains to our
customers. As a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will
vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the
marketplace. 
Packaway merchandise is purchased
with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The
timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven
by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the
Companys store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway
varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically
packaway remains in storage less than six months. 
Changes in packaway inventory
levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2011, packaway
inventory was 49% of total inventory compared to 47% and 38% at the end of
fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Packaway inventory as a percentage of our
total inventory has increased since 2010 as we took advantage of the increased
availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace. 
The change in total merchandise
inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of
cash of approximately $55 million and $112 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
Accounts payable leverage (defined
as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) decreased to 67% as of
January 28, 2012 from 71% as of January 29, 2011 as a result of higher packaway
inventory. 
We believe that our existing cash
balances, cash flows from operations, available bank credit lines and trade
credit are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve
months. 
Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing
activities was $471.8 million, $196.8 million, and $136.8 million in fiscal
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash used for investing
activities for fiscal 2011, compared to the prior year was primarily due to
higher capital expenditures and a transfer of funds into restricted accounts to
serve as collateral for our insurance obligations.
In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
our capital expenditures were $416.3 million, $198.7 million, and $158.5
million, respectively. Our capital expenditures include costs for fixtures and
leasehold improvements to open new stores and costs to implement information
technology systems, build or expand distribution centers, and various other
expenditures related to our stores, buying, and corporate offices. We opened 80,
56, and 56 new stores in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
In April 2011, we purchased a
449,000 square foot warehouse for packaway storage in Riverside, California for
$20.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we purchased the land and building
of an existing store location in Southern California which was previously
leased, and we acquired land and buildings for our future corporate headquarters
in Dublin, California, for a combined total of approximately $100 million. 
23


We are forecasting approximately
$450 million in capital expenditures in 2012 to fund expenditures for fixtures
and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dds DISCOUNTS stores, for
the relocation or upgrade of existing stores, for investments in store and
merchandising systems, buildings, and equipment, for building distribution
centers and implementing material handling equipment and related systems, and
for various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these
expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations. 
Our capital expenditures over the
last three years are set forth in the table below:

We had no purchases of investments
in fiscal 2011, and purchased investments of $6.8 million and $2.9 million in
fiscal 2010, and 2009, respectively. We had sales of investments of $4.6
million, $8.6 million, and $24.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively. 
Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing
activities was $532.4 million, $410.6 million, and $304.6 million in fiscal
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, our
liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash
flows from operations. Our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, one
distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and
all but three of our store locations are leased and, except for certain
leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent capital investments. We
own distribution centers in each of the following cities: Carlisle,
Pennsylvania; Moreno Valley, California; and Fort Mill, South Carolina; we own
two warehouse facilities, one in Fort Mill, South Carolina and the other in
Riverside, California.
We repurchased 11.3 million, 13.5
million, and 14.8 million shares of our common stock for aggregate purchase
prices of approximately $450 million, $375 million, and $300 million in fiscal 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a
two-year $900 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2011 and
2012.
In January 2012, our Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.14 per common share, payable
on March 30, 2012. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of
$.11 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2011, cash dividends
of $.08 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2010, and cash
dividends of $.055 per common share in January, May, August, and November
2009.
Short-term trade credit represents
a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises
from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly
review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be
able to maintain adequate trade, bank, and other credit lines to meet our
capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2012.

In March 2011, we entered into a
new $600 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. This credit facility,
which replaced our previous $600 million revolving credit facility, expires in
March 2016. Interest on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable
margin (currently 150 basis points) and is payable upon maturity but not less
than quarterly. As of January 28, 2012, our $600 million credit facility remains
in place and available. 
We estimate that existing cash
balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are
adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital
investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at
least the next twelve months.

1We have a $53.5
million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in other
long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. This liability is
excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably
estimated. 
Senior notes. We have two series of unsecured senior notes with various
institutional investors for $150 million. The Series A notes totaling $85
million are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The
Series B notes totaling $65 million are due in December 2021 and bear interest
at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment
obligations in the table above. These notes are subject to prepayment penalties
for early payment of principal. 
Borrowings under these notes are
subject to certain operating and financial covenants, including interest
coverage and other financial ratios. As of January 28, 2012, we were in
compliance with these covenants. 
Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 
Operating
leases. We lease our buying offices,
corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three
warehouse facilities, and all but three of our store locations. Except for
certain leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not
represent long-term capital investments. 
We have lease arrangements for
certain equipment in our stores for our point-of-sale (POS) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two
or three years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to
three one-year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment
at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of
the equipment of $1.2 million at the end of the respective initial lease terms,
which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above.

We lease a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this
distribution center are financed by the lessor under a $70 million ten-year
synthetic lease that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is
payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70
million. At the end of the lease term, we have the option to either refinance
the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at
the amount of the then-outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the
distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a
third party for less than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value
guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. As of
January 28, 2012, we have accrued approximately $4.6 million related to an
estimated shortfall in the residual value guarantee recorded in accrued expenses
and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The synthetic lease
agreement includes a prepayment penalty for early payoff of the lease. Our
contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease
obligations in the above table.
25


We have also recognized a
liability and corresponding asset for the inception date estimated fair values
of the distribution center and POS synthetic lease residual value guarantees. As
of January 28, 2012 we have approximately $1.4 million of residual value
guarantee asset and liability. These residual value guarantees are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion
of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and other and
accrued expenses, respectively, and the long-term portion of the related assets
and liabilities is recorded in other long-term assets and other long-term
liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We lease three warehouses. Two of
the warehouses are in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with leases expiring in 2013 and
2014. The third warehouse is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, with a lease expiring
in 2013. The leases for all three of these warehouses contain renewal
provisions. We also own a 423,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South
Carolina and a 449,000 square foot warehouse in Riverside, California. All five
of these warehouses are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease a
10-acre parcel that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to our
Perris, California distribution center.

We lease approximately 181,000
square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton,
California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire
between 2014 and 2015 and contain renewal provisions.
We lease approximately 201,000 and
26,000 square feet of office space for our New York City and Los Angeles buying
offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2021 and
2014, respectively, and contain renewal provisions. 
Purchase obligations.
As of January 28, 2012 we had purchase
obligations of approximately $1,243 million. These purchase obligations
primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related
to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and
maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $1,172 million
represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 28, 2012.

For additional information
relating to this credit facility, refer to note D of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. 
Revolving credit
facility. At January 28, 2012, we had
available a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility with our banks.
This credit facility expires in March 2016 and contains a $300 million sublimit
for issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this credit facility is
based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) and is
payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under
this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain financial ratios. As of January 28, 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding or letters of credits issued under this facility and were in compliance with the covenants. As of January 28, 2012, our $600 million credit facility remains in place and available.
26


The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have
covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and
other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under the revolving
credit facility may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved.
As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants.
Standby letters of credit and  collateral trust. In
July 2011, we entered into new standby letters  of credit outside of our revolving credit facility and set up a trust to
collateralize our insurance obligations. As of January 28, 2012 we had $45.3 million in  standby letters of credit which are
collateralized by restricted cash and cash  equivalents and $21.3 million in a collateral trust consisting of restricted
cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
At January 29, 2011, we had $69.6
million in standby letters of credit outstanding issued under our revolving
credit facility. 
Trade letters of credit.
We had $39.9 million and $35.2 million
in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011,
respectively.
Other 
Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions
are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on
various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the
following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Merchandise inventory.
Our merchandise inventory is stated at
the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable
value. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at
the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway
inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses
until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our
stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the
merchandise, and its relation to the Companys store merchandise assortment
plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and
seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six
months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49% and 47% of total
inventories as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. Merchandise inventory
includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway
inventory. 
Included in the carrying value of
our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is
based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical
merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions,
markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if
sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated,
additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required. 
Long-lived assets.
We record a long-lived asset impairment
charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash
flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted
cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.
If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment
charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual
analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required
for fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009.
27


Depreciation and amortization
expense. Property and equipment are
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset, typically ranging from five to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years
for land improvements and buildings. The cost of leasehold improvements is
amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable
lease term.
Lease accounting.
When a lease contains rent holidays or
requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference
between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable
under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We begin recording rent expense on
the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other
long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant
improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in
the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Insurance obligations.  We use a
combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation,
general liability, and  employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined
actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims
occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves
may not  be sufficient and additional charges could be required. 
Stock-based compensation.
We recognize compensation expense based
upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards. We use historical data
to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock-based compensation
expense. All stock-based compensation awards are expensed over the service or
performance periods of the awards. 
Income taxes. We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740. We are required to make
assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Our policy is to
recognize interest and/or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax
expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately
become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of
the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made.

The critical accounting policies
noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting
policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is
specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with
no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in
which managements judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle
over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures
required by GAAP. 
Effects of inflation or
deflation. We do not consider the
effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and
results of operations. 
New Accounting
Pronouncements
In May 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820):
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements
in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 changes the wording used
to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and
for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 also expands the disclosures required
for fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is to be applied prospectively and is
effective for the Company in fiscal 2012. We believe adoption of this guidance
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):
Presentation of Comprehensive Income, (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 eliminates
the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the
statement of changes in equity. ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes
in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This new
guidance is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for the Company in
fiscal 2012. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Forward-Looking Statements

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2011, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports, and other investor communications including those
on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements
regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected
sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These
forward-looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections, and
estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance,
operations, and competitive position. The words plan, expect, target,
anticipate, estimate, believe, forecast, projected, guidance,
looking ahead, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Future economic and industry
trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain
difficult to predict. As a result, our forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations
and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more
complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. The factors
underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any
forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given
and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We
disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking
statements. 
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
We are exposed to market risks,
which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial
transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We occasionally use forward
contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no
outstanding forward contracts as of January 28, 2012. 
Interest that is payable on our
revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore,
affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 28, 2012, we had no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In addition, lease
payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on
variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market
interest rates.
In addition, we have two
outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors: Series A
for $85 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B for $65 million accrues
interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of January 28,
2012 was $150 million. 
Interest is receivable on our
short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest
income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.

A hypothetical 100 basis point
increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have
materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments as of and
for the year ended January 28, 2012. We do not consider the potential losses in
future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near-term changes in
interest rates to be material.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Note A: Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies 
Business. Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is
an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer
apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the
end of fiscal 2011, the Company operated 1,037 Ross Dress for Less®
(Ross) locations in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 88 dds
DISCOUNTS® stores in seven states, all of which are supported by four
distribution centers. The Companys headquarters, one buying office, two
distribution centers, one warehouse, and 26% of its stores are located in
California. 
Segment reporting.
The Company has one reportable segment.
The Companys operations include only activities related to off-price retailing
in stores throughout the United States. 
Basis of presentation and
fiscal year. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of
which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar
and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2012, January
29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 are referred to as fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and
fiscal 2009, respectively, and had 52 weeks. 
Stock dividend.
On November 16, 2011, the Companys
Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of the Companys common stock
issued in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders of record as of November
29, 2011 were issued one additional share of common stock on December 15, 2011
for each share held. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the
two-for-one stock split effective December 15, 2011. 
Use of accounting estimates.
The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
Companys significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for
inventory shortage, packaway inventory costs, useful lives of fixed assets,
self-insurance reserves, and uncertain tax position reserves. 
Purchase obligations.
As of January 28, 2012, the Company had
purchase obligations of approximately $1,243 million. These purchase obligations
primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related
to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and
maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $1,172 million
represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 28,
2012. 
Cash and cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less. 
Restricted cash, cash
equivalents, and investments. The
Company has restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments to serve as
collateral for certain of the Companys insurance obligations. These restricted
funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. Government
and agency securities, and corporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the
Companys account without the prior written consent of the secured parties. As
of January 28, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $61.1 million
and investments of $5.7 million in restricted accounts. As of January 28, 2012
restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $18.7 million and $48.1
million were included in prepaid expenses and other and other long-term assets,
respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The classification
between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the
secured insurance obligations. 
34


Investments. The Companys investments are comprised of various debt
securities. At January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, these investments were
classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are
classified as either short- or long-term based on their original maturities and
the Companys intent. Investments with an original maturity of less than one
year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.

Merchandise inventory.
Merchandise inventory is stated at the
lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable
value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both
during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory.
Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the
Company's warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway
inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality
of the merchandise, and its relation to the Companys store merchandise
assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category
and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than
six months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49% and 47% of total
inventories as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. Merchandise inventory
includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway
inventory. The cost of the Companys merchandise inventory is reduced by
valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the
Companys physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.
Cost of goods sold.
In addition to product costs,
the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight
expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related
to the Companys retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. Buying
expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses
include the cost of operating the Companys distribution centers.
Prepaid expenses and other.
Prepaid expenses and other as of January
28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 consisted of the following:

Property and equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset,
typically ranging from five to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for
land improvements and buildings. Depreciation and amortization expense on
property and equipment was $159.9 million, $160.7 million, and $159.0 million
for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The cost of leasehold
improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable
lease term, whichever is less. Computer hardware and software costs, net of
amortization, of $137.1 million and $102.0 million at January 28, 2012 and
January 29, 2011, respectively, are included in fixtures and equipment and are
amortized over their estimated useful life, generally ranging from five to seven
years. The Company capitalizes interest during the construction period. Interest
capitalized was $0.5 million and $0.1 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010,
respectively. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the
Company purchased the land and building of an existing store location in
Southern California which was previously leased, and acquired the land and
buildings for its future corporate headquarters in Dublin, California, for a
combined total of approximately $100 million.

Other assets are principally
comprised of prepaid rent and other long-term prepayments. 
Property, other long-term assets,
and certain identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets
that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Companys evaluation
during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, no impairment charges were recorded.

Store closures.
The Company continually reviews the
operating performance of individual stores. For stores that are closed, the
Company records a liability for future minimum lease payments net of estimated
sublease recoveries and related ancillary costs at the time the liability is
incurred. In 2011, the Company closed ten Ross stores. In 2010, the Company
closed six Ross stores. The lease loss liability related to certain of these
closed stores was $3.0 million and $4.9 million, as of January 28, 2012 and
January 29, 2011, respectively. Operating costs, including depreciation, of
stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain in use.

Accounts
payable. Accounts payable represents
amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable
includes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet
presented for payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of
approximately $78.9 million and $53.4 million at January 28, 2012 and January
29, 2011, respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts
in operating cash flows.
Insurance obligations.  The Company uses
a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and  deductible liability is determined
actuarially, based on claims filed and an  estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance and deductible
reserves as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 consisted of the following:

Lease accounting.
When a lease contains rent holidays or
requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company records
rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the
difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount
payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company begins
recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement
allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over
the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a
component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Estimated fair value of
financial instruments. The carrying
value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, accounts
receivable, other long-term assets, accounts payable, and other long-term
liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for
additional fair value information. 
Revenue recognition.
The Company recognizes revenue at the
point of sale and maintains an allowance for estimated future returns. Sales of
gift cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company
merchandise. The Companys gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon
historical redemption rates, a small percentage of gift cards will never be
redeemed, which represents breakage. The Company recognizes income from gift
card breakage as a reduction of operating expenses when redemption by a customer
is considered to be remote. Income recognized from breakage was not significant
in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. 
Sales tax collected is not
recognized as revenue and is included in accrued expenses and other. 
Allowance for sales returns.
An allowance for the gross margin loss
on estimated sales returns is included in accrued expenses and other in the
consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for sales returns consists of the
following:

Store pre-opening.
Store pre-opening costs are expensed in
the period incurred. 
Advertising. Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Advertising costs for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $59.9 million, $54.3
million, and $53.5 million, respectively. 
37


Stock-based compensation.
The Company recognizes compensation
expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards,
typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the
Companys stock-based compensation plans.
Taxes on earnings.
The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In
estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected
future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 also
clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or
all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a companys
consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of
more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be
recognized in the consolidated financial statements. See Note F. 
Treasury stock.
The Company records treasury stock at
cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax
withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock
grants. 
Earnings per
share (EPS). The Company computes and
reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net
earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the
weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution
that could occur from outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised
stock options and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based
awards of restricted stock.
In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009
there were 5,900, 6,400, and 39,600 weighted average shares, respectively, that
could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were excluded from the
calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive
for those years. 
The following is a reconciliation
of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS
computations:

Comprehensive income.
Comprehensive income consists of net
earnings and other comprehensive income (loss), principally unrealized
investment gains or losses. Components of comprehensive income are presented in
the consolidated statements of stockholders equity. 
New accounting
standards. In May 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820):
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements
in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 changes the wording used
to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and
for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 also expands the disclosures required
for fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is to be applied prospectively and is
effective for the Company in fiscal 2012. The Company believes the adoption of
this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):
Presentation of Comprehensive Income, (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 eliminates
the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the
statement of changes in equity. ASU 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes
in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This new
guidance is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for the Company in
fiscal 2012. The Company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Accounting standards pertaining to
fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level
1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level
2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either
directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs
in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to
develop its own assumptions. 
This fair value hierarchy also
requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Corporate, U.S. government
and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or
Level 2 because these securities are valued using quoted market prices or
alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable
inputs.

Note D: Debt
Senior notes. The Company has two series of unsecured senior notes with
various institutional investors for $150 million. The Series A notes totaling
$85 million are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The
Series B notes totaling $65 million are due in December 2021 and bear interest
at a rate of 6.53%. The fair value of these notes as of January 28, 2012 of
approximately $190 million is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes.
The senior notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of
principal.
Revolving credit
facility. In March 2011, the Company
entered into a new $600 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. This
credit facility, which replaced the Companys previous $600 million revolving
credit facility, expires in March 2016 and contains a $300 million sublimit for
issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this facility is based on
LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) and is payable upon
maturity but not less than quarterly. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
or letters of credit issued under this facility as of January 28, 2012. As of
January 28, 2012, the Companys $600 million credit facility remains in place
and available. 
At January 29, 2011, the Company
had a $600 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. Interest pricing on
this facility was LIBOR plus 45 basis points and contained a $300 million
sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $230.4 million was
available.
Borrowings under the credit
facility and the senior notes are subject to certain covenants, including
interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates
under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on actual interest
coverage ratios achieved. As of January 28, 2012, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants. 
Standby letters of credit and
collateral trust. In July 2011, the Company entered
into new standby letters of credit outside of its revolving credit facility and set up a trust
to collateralize its insurance obligations. As of January 28, 2012, the Company
had $45.3 million in standby letters of credit which are collateralized by
restricted cash and cash equivalents and $21.3 million in a collateral trust
consisting of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
At January 29, 2011, the Company
had $69.6 million in outstanding standby letters of credit issued under its
revolving credit facility. 
Trade letters of
credit. The Company also had $39.9
million and $35.2 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28,
2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively.
Note E: Leases 
The Company leases all but three
of its store sites with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range
from three to ten years. Store leases typically contain provisions for three to
four renewal options of five years each. Most store leases also provide for
minimum annual rentals and for payment of certain expenses. In addition, some
store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of
sales.
The Company has lease arrangements
for certain equipment in its stores for its point-of-sale (POS) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two
or three years and the Company typically has options to renew the leases for two
to three one-year periods. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the
equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Companys
obligation under the residual value guarantee at the end of the respective lease
terms is $1.2 million.
43


The Company also leases a 1.3
million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and
building for this distribution center are financed by the lessor under a $70
million ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent
expense on this distribution center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of
5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, the
Company must refinance the distribution facility, purchase it at the amount of
the then-outstanding lease balance, or sell it to a third party. If the
distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, the
Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any
shortfall amount up to $56 million. As of January 28, 2012, the Company has
accrued approximately $4.6 million related to an estimated shortfall in the
residual value guarantee recorded in accrued expenses and other in the
consolidated balance sheets. The synthetic lease agreement includes a prepayment
penalty for early payoff of the lease.
The Company has also recognized a
liability and corresponding asset for the inception date estimated fair values
of the distribution center and POS synthetic lease residual value guarantees. As
of January 28, 2012 the Company had approximately $1.4 million of residual value
guarantee asset and liability. These residual value guarantees are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion
of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and other,
and accrued expenses and other, respectively, and the long-term portion of the
related assets and liabilities is recorded in other long-term assets and other
long-term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as the Companys revolving credit facility and senior
notes, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain
interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates
under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on the Companys actual
interest coverage ratios. As of January 28, 2012, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants. 
The Company leases three
warehouses. Two of the warehouses are in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with leases
expiring in 2013 and 2014. The third warehouse is in Fort Mill, South Carolina,
with a lease expiring in 2013. The leases for all three of these warehouses
contain renewal provisions. The Company also owns a 423,000 square foot
warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina and a 449,000 square foot warehouse in
Riverside, California. All five of these warehouses are used to store the
Companys packaway inventory. The Company also leases a 10-acre parcel that has
been developed for trailer parking adjacent to its Perris, California
distribution center.
The Company leases approximately
181,000 square feet of office space for its corporate headquarters in
Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The terms for these
leases expire between 2014 and 2015 and contain renewal provisions.
The Company leases approximately
201,000 and 26,000 square feet of office space for its New York City and Los
Angeles buying offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities
expire in 2021 and 2014, respectively, and contain renewal provisions.

At the end of fiscal 2011, 2010,
and 2009, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits (net of federal tax
benefits) were $53.5 million, $41.8 million, and $33.6 million inclusive of
$12.0 million, $12.0 million, and $10.0 million of related interest,
respectively. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings. If
recognized, $36.0 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. The
difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amounts
that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to
deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and
state income taxes. 
46


During the next twelve months, it
is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations may lapse pertaining to
positions taken by the Company in prior year tax returns. If this occurs, the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease, reducing the provision
for taxes on earnings by up to $1.2 million. 
The Company is generally open to
audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for
fiscal years 2008 through 2011. The Companys state income tax returns are
generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal
years 2007 through 2011. Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by
state tax authorities. The Company does not expect the results of these audits
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
Note G: Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined
contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan,
employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for
favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This
plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable
under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employees
salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan
were $8.7 million, $8.2 million, and $7.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and
2009, respectively.
The Company also has an Incentive
Compensation Plan which provides cash awards to key management and employees
based on Company and individual performance.
The Company also makes available
to management a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows management
to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) plan.
Other long-term assets include $67.5 million and $63.6 million at January 28,
2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, of long-term plan investments, at
market value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan (See Note B). Plan investments are designated by the
participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. The
Company has a corresponding liability to participants of $67.5 million and $63.6
million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, included in
other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
In addition, the Company has
certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment medical
benefits. The estimated liability for these benefits of $5.7 million and $4.9
million is included in accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011,
respectively. 
Note H: Stockholders' Equity

Common stock. The Company repurchased 11.3 million, 13.4 million, and
14.8 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of
approximately $450 million, $375 million, and $300 million in fiscal 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively. In January 2011, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a two-year $900 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2011 and
2012.
The following table summarizes the
Companys stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009:

stock is issued or outstanding. 
Dividends. In January 2012, the Companys Board of Directors
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.14 per common share, payable on March
30, 2012. The Companys Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of
$.11 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2011, cash dividends
of $.08 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2010, and cash
dividends of $.055 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2009.

2008 Equity Incentive Plan.
In 2008, the Companys stockholders
approved the adoption of the Ross Stores, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the
2008 Plan) with an initial share reserve of 16.5 million shares of the
Companys common stock, of which 12.0 million shares can be issued as full value
awards. The 2008 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may
potentially include the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock
units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred compensation awards.
As of January 28, 2012, there were 7.8 million shares that remained available
for grant under the 2008 Plan.

The market value of restricted
shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over the vesting
period of generally three to five years. The unamortized compensation expense at
January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 was $67.5 million and $56.8 million,
respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
remaining period of 2.0 years. Intrinsic value for restricted stock, defined as
the closing market value on the last business day of fiscal year 2011 (or
$51.09), was $273.5 million. A total of 7,811,000, 8,770,000, and 9,886,000
shares were available for new restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, shares
purchased by the Company for tax withholding totaled 442,000, 350,000, and
326,000 shares, respectively, and are considered treasury shares which are
available for reissuance. As of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, the
Company held 3,354,000 and 2,932,000 shares of treasury stock, respectively.

Performance share  awards. The Company has
a performance  share award program for senior executives. A performance share award represents  a right to receive shares of
common stock on a specified settlement date based  on the Companys attainment of a profitability-based performance goal
during the  performance period, which is the Companys fiscal year. If attained, the common stock then issued vests over the
service period, generally three years from the date the performance award was  granted. The Company issued approximately
467,000, 656,000, and 792,000 shares in settlement  of the fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 awards.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP), eligible full-time employees participating in the annual offering
period can choose to have up to the lesser of 10% or $21,250 of their annual
base earnings withheld to purchase the Companys common stock. The purchase
price of the stock is 85% of the closing market price on the date of purchase.
In addition, purchases occur on a quarterly basis (on the last trading day of
each calendar quarter). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights
equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date. 
During fiscal 2011, 2010, and
2009, employees purchased approximately 243,000, 292,000, and 332,000 shares,
respectively, of the Companys common stock under the plan at weighted average
per share prices of $34.24, $23.74, and $17.38, respectively. Through January
28, 2012, approximately 18,723,000 shares had been issued under this plan and
1,277,000 shares remained available for future issuance. 
Note I: Related Party
Transactions 
The Company has a consulting
agreement with Norman Ferber, its Chairman of the Board of Directors, under
which the Company pays him an annual consulting fee of $1.3 million through
May 2016. In addition, the agreement provides for administrative support and
health and other benefits for the individual and his dependents, which totaled
approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, along with amounts to
cover premiums through May 2016 on a life insurance policy with a death
benefit of $2.0 million. On termination of Mr. Ferbers consultancy with the
Company, the Company will pay Mr. Ferber $75,000 per year for a period of 10
years.
49


Note J: Litigation, Claims, and
Assessments
Like many California retailers,
the Company has been named in class action lawsuits regarding wage and hour
claims. Class action litigation involving allegations that hourly associates
have missed meal and/or rest break periods, as well as allegations of unpaid
overtime wages to store managers and assistant store managers at Company stores
under state law remains pending as of January 28, 2012. 
The Company is also party to
various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
Actions filed against the Company include commercial, product, customer,
intellectual property, and labor and employment-related claims, including
lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that the Company violated state or federal
laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of
these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to
uncertainties.
In the opinion of management, the
resolution of pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal
proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and
Stockholders
Ross Stores, Inc.
Pleasanton, California 
We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2012. We also have
audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January
28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

53


In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28,
2012 and January 29, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2012, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 28, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission.

      AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 
Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 
Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at that
reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this
report.
It should be noted that any system
of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In
addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events. 
Managements Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as
set forth in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 28, 2012.
Our internal control over
financial reporting as of January 28, 2012 has also been audited by Deloitte
& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their
opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
is stated in their report, dated March 27, 2012, which is included in Item 8 in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any
control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
Quarterly Evaluation of Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to
determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our
management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal
quarter.
