  Part I     
 
    Item 1.  Business     
       The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively,
including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products
business. It conducts its business primarily in the United States. 
       The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate is reinventing protection and retirement to help individuals in approximately 16 million households protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Customers can access
Allstate products and services such as auto insurance and homeowners insurance through nearly 12,000 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the United States and Canada. Allstate
is the 2nd largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2010 statutory direct premiums earned. In addition, according to A.M. Best,
it is the nation's 16th largest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2010 ordinary life insurance in force and 21st largest on the basis of 2010
statutory admitted assets. 


Allstate
has four business segments: 













      Allstate
Protection
 
      Discontinued Lines and
Coverages


      Allstate
Financial
 
      Corporate and
Other





 
       To achieve its goals in 2012, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

maintain auto profitability; raise returns in homeowners and annuity businesses; grow insurance premiums; and 
proactively manage investments and capital. 
       In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position. 
 
 
  ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT     
 Products and Distribution  
       Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 92% of Allstate's 2011 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this
segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through call centers and the internet. These products are marketed under the
Allstate®, Encompass® and Esurance® brand names. The Allstate Protection segment also includes a separate organization called Emerging Businesses which comprises
Business Insurance (commercial products for small business owners), Consumer Household (specialty products including motorcycle, boat, renters and condominium insurance policies), Allstate Dealer
Services (insurance and non-insurance products sold primarily to auto dealers), Allstate Roadside Services (retail and wholesale roadside assistance products) and Ivantage (insurance
agency). We also participate in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance business in order to maintain our licenses to do business in many states. In some states, Allstate exclusive
agencies offer non-proprietary property insurance products. 
       Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral
versus brand-sensitive). Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who prefer local personal advice and service
and are brand-sensitive. In most states, customers can also purchase certain Allstate brand personal insurance products, and obtain service, directly through call centers and the internet. Beginning
in 2012, Allstate Brand direct sales and service will focus on serving customers who prefer personal advice and assistance and work closer with Allstate exclusive agencies. Encompass brand auto and
homeowners insurance products are sold through independent agencies and serve customers who prefer personal service and support primarily from an independent agent and are brand-neutral. Esurance
brand auto insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through call centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial, and serve the self-directed,
brand-sensitive 
1



 
Table of Contents
customers.
Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers and offers
comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately twenty insurance companies through its website and over the phone. 
       Allstate
is transitioning to a new compensation structure for its Allstate exclusive agencies over the next two years. The plan will better align compensation with customer needs and
reward higher performance. The cost neutral change will include a shift to a higher proportion of variable compensation and bonus. In 2012, base commission remains unchanged and the annual bonus will
be based on portfolio growth and household bundling. 
       Total
Allstate Protection premiums written were $25.98 billion in 2011. Our broad-based network of approximately 10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,700
locations in the U.S. produced approximately 86% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premiums in 2011. 10% of Allstate Protection's written premiums in 2011 were generated by approximately
4,400 independent agencies. To support customer service, we are supporting Allstate exclusive agencies by providing products, tools, education, and resources to help them acquire more business and
retain more customers. Our programs provide financing to agents to acquire books of business and award additional resources to better performing agencies, leading to fewer agencies of larger size.
Approximately 300 of the decrease in the number of Allstate exclusive agencies from 11,500 in 2010 is due to consolidation of a small number of locations that, for specified reasons, were allowed to
operate with two agent numbers. We are among the nine largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory
written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2010. The remainder of Allstate Protection's written premiums in 2011 were primarily generated directly through call centers and the
internet. 
       Additionally,
Allstate distribution, through brokering arrangements, offers non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not available. As of
December 31, 2011, Allstate distribution has approximately $1.0 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $130 million of non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had $400 million of
non-proprietary premiums written in 2011. 
 Competition  
       The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according
to A.M. Best.

       In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our
distribution system, price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and
pricing experience enables Allstate to use pricing sophistication to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base. 
       Pricing
sophistication and related underwriting and marketing programs use a number of risk evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to
vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance
scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history;
age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring based on credit report information. 
       Our
primary focus in using pricing sophistication methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. The aim has been to enhance Allstate's competitive position with
respect to "target" market segments while 
2



 
Table of Contents
maintaining
or improving profitability. "Target customers" generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including auto, homeowners and financial
products, who have better retention and potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. We provide and continue to enhance a range of
discounts to attract more target customers. For example, we discount auto insurance to attract and retain target customers. In many states, we discount homeowners insurance for customers who insure
their automobiles with Allstate. 
       Allstate
Your Choice Auto® insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of optional auto insurance packages at various prices. We believe that Allstate Your
Choice Auto differentiates Allstate from its competitors and allows for increased growth and increased retention. Allstate Your Choice Home® allows qualified customers to choose from
options such as a claim-free bonus and greater ability to tailor their own home insurance protection coverage. Allstate Blue® is our non-standard auto insurance
product which offers features such as a loyalty bonus and roadside assistance coverage. We have also introduced a claim satisfaction guarantee that promises a return of premium to any Allstate Brand
standard auto insurance customer dissatisfied with their claims experience, which differentiates Allstate from the competition. 
 Geographic Markets  
       The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada through a distribution system similar to that used in the United States. 
       The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for the year ended December 31, 2011,
based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the premiums earned for the segment.

       We continue to take actions to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce variability in our
earnings. Accordingly, we expect to continue to adjust underwriting practices with respect to our property business in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. Our comprehensive strategic
review of our homeowners insurance business is ongoing. 
 Additional Information  
       Information regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Protection segment is
contained in Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 19 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to our
property-liability operations, which includes our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 19 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by
reference. 
       Information
regarding the amount of premium earned for Allstate Protection segment products for the last three years is set forth in Part II, Item 7 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the table regarding premiums earned by brand. That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1
by reference. 
 
 
  ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT     
 Products and Distribution  
       Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance
products. Our principal products are interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities including deferred and immediate; and voluntary accident and health insurance. Our
institutional products, which we most recently offered in 2008, consist of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional
and individual investors. Banking products and services were offered to customers through the Allstate Bank through September 2011. The table on page 4 lists our major distribution channels for
this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers.

Table of Contents
       As
the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive
financial specialists, independent agents, specialized structured settlement brokers and directly through call centers and the internet. We sell products through independent agents affiliated with
approximately 125 master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate exclusive agencies also sell our voluntary accident and health insurance products primarily to
employees of unaffiliated businesses.

approximately $7.5 billion of non-proprietary mutual funds and fixed and variable annuity account balances under management. 
       In
2011, after receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased operations. In the first half of 2012, we expect to cancel the bank's charter and deregister
The Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding company.

Table of Contents
 Competition  
       We compete on a wide variety of factors, including the scope of our distribution systems, the type of our product offerings, the
recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our differentiated product features and prices, and the level of customer service that we provide. With regard to funding agreements, we
compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings. 
       The
market for life insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 450 groups
of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2010, the Allstate Financial segment is
the nation's 16th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2010 ordinary life insurance in force and 21st largest on the basis of
2010 statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment
advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as
well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry. 
 Geographic Markets  
       We sell life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States.
Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We also sell funding
agreements in the United States. 
       The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended

and annuity considerations.

(1)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $2.59 billion, $2.07 billion and $2.14 billion as of
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

       The year-end 2011 gross reserves of $20.38 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined
under GAAP, were $3.83 billion more than the net reserve balance of $16.55 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory
authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $2.59 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP
reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.00 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

Table of Contents
       As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2010 decreased in 2011 by $335 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $174 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance
cessions. 
 Loss Reserve Reestimates  
       The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect
to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's
expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation
period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. 
       The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

       As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general,
reflect additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced
by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years
attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to
older years along with reserve strengthening as discussed below. 
       The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the
ten-year period ended December 31, 2011. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which
the reestimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve
reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses. Since December 31, 2003, the changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation
filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

       In 2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates and catastrophe losses. The increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. 
       In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to the litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. 
       In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008
non-injury reserves to older years. 
       In

  REGULATION     
       Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. In
general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters,
including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, price setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims
practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and
corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a
discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 
       In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank") was enacted in 2010. Hundreds of regulations must still be promulgated and implemented pursuant to
this new law, and we cannot predict what the final regulations will require but do not expect a material impact on Allstate's operations. The new law also created the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO")
within the Treasury Department. The FIO will monitor the insurance industry, provide advice to the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, represent the U.S. on international insurance matters and
study the current regulatory system and submit a report to Congress in 2012. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state
insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures
would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment, including recognizing the need for better catastrophe preparedness, improving appropriate risk based pricing and
promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions for mega-catastrophes that will make insurance more available and affordable. We have also taken actions to
reduce the catastrophe exposure in our property business and also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines. 
        Agent and Broker Compensation.    In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. New disclosure requirements
have been imposed in certain circumstances upon agents and brokers in New York. 
        Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.    As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other 
9



 
Table of Contents
jurisdictions
that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive. 
       Insurance Holding Company Regulation.    The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to
regulation
in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Nebraska, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California, Florida, and Utah. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide
that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the
relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or
more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a
change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the
state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer
if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally
require prior approval by the state insurance departments in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department
would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and
where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay, or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation's
common stock. 
        Price Regulation.    Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the
objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. 
       The
speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior
approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before
the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the
regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen
states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing. 
       An
insurer's ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or
proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can
manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a price that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. 
       From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set prices at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing has
been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators, legislators, and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the
Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing. 
        Involuntary Markets.    As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations. 
10



 
Table of Contents
       Guaranty Funds.    Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. 
        National Flood Insurance Program.    We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commissions and adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims that fall
under the arrangement. 
        Investment Regulation.    Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of
measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments. 
        Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.    Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example,
states limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval
requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets. 
        Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.    The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). 
       Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.    The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators. 
        Banking.    Allstate Bank ceased operations in 2011, and we expect to cancel its charter and deregister The Allstate
Corporation as a savings and loan holding company in the first half of 2012. The principal supervisory authority for the diversified unitary savings and loan holding company activities of The Allstate
Corporation is the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), and the principal supervisory authority for the Bank is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). The Allstate Corporation and the Bank,
respectively, are subject to FRB and OCC regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements and enforcement authority. The Bank is also subject to the authority of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. 
        Privacy Regulation.    Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information. 
        Asbestos.    Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but unified support among various
defendant and
insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos. 
       Environmental.    Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration
of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or "ECLs") establish a mechanism to assign liability
to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are
thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in
dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties' alleged
liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether
Superfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages 
11

under
the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate
allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and
waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may
be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted.

    Item 1A.  Risk Factors     
       This document contains "forward-looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are
subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 
       These
forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should,"
"anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our
strategy for growth, catastrophe exposure management, product development, investment results, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe
that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other
risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. 
       In
addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other
financial services. These risks constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they
identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and historical trends. These cautionary statements are not
exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document, in our filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference. 
 Risks Relating to the Property-Liability business  
 As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events  
       Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may
vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made events, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, tornadoes,
tsunamis, hurricanes, tropical storms and certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those
experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) estimate of loss from external hurricane and
earthquake models at various levels of profitability. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial
condition. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, the Northridge earthquake of 1994 totaling
$2.1 billion and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various state-created insurance
facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses
or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. 
       In
addition, we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely
unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur. 
 The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operating results and financial condition  
       Along with others in the industry, we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property insurance exposure to
catastrophe losses. These models assume various conditions and probability scenarios. Such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred.
Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in-force
business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities, there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting
period. These limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models, material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data
elements and actual conditions that are not well understood and not properly incorporated into the models including seismic and weather phenomenon, demand surge, loss adjustment expense and impact of
non-modeled conditions that compound losses.

Table of Contents
 Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth  
       Due to our catastrophe risk management efforts, the size of our homeowners business has been negatively impacted and may continue to be
negatively impacted if we take further actions. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure, size and
underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to the diminished potential for cross-selling opportunities that cannot be fully replaced by our
brokering arrangement to allow our agents to write property products with other carriers, new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected. 
 A regulatory environment that limits rate increases and requires us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect our operating
results and financial condition  
       From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may
not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, if Allstate Protection's loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may impose rate
rollbacks, require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders, or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory
resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability, in all product lines, to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and
returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost. 
       In
addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property-liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans,
reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise
charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity, or as the facilities
recognize a financial deficit, they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations of many
states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain
states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the
state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. 
 The potential benefits of our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized  
       We believe that pricing sophistication and underwriting (including Strategic Risk Management which, in some situations, considers
information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because many of our competitors have adopted
underwriting criteria and sophisticated pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, our competitive advantage could decline or be lost. Further, the use of
insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest
groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our pricing sophistication models. Furthermore, we cannot be assured that these pricing sophistication models will
accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur. 
 Allstate Protection's operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business  
       The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition,
less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high
premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 Unexpected increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  
       Unexpected changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in
bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in
auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings, and
by other economic and environmental factors, including 
15



 
Table of Contents
increased
demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in
these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the
Georgia Supreme Court which held that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law and the emergence of mold-related homeowners losses in the state of Texas
during 2002. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these
initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. 
       Our
Allstate Protection segment may experience volatility in claim frequency from time to time, and short-term trends may not continue over the longer term. In recent years
gas prices have increased while miles driven have declined to the lowest level since 2008. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition. 
 Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  
       Recorded claim reserves in the Property-Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but
not reported ("IBNR"), after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical
trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms. External factors are also considered which include, but are not
limited to, law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR
losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded
reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines is inherently uncertain and may have a material effect on our operating results and
financial condition  
       The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues
concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and whether losses could be
recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos-related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex, lengthy proceedings that
involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. Actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate
indicators of the extent
of probable loss. Ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material effect on our operating results and
financial condition. 
 Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment  
 Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial condition  
       Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and
operating costs and expenses of the business. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that we must hold to support in-force
contracts taking into account rating agencies and regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis, which
could result in the discontinuation or de-emphasis of products or distribution relationships and a decline in sales. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years
depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Additionally, many of our products have fixed or guaranteed terms
that limit our ability to increase revenues or reduce benefits, including credited interest, once the product has been issued. 
       Our
profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment spreads, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, the sufficiency of premiums and
contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses, and the management of operating costs and expenses within
anticipated pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition.

 Changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results  
       The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions
of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly
from assumptions, adjustments to reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") may be required which could have a material effect on our operating results. 
 Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread-based products  
       Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial spread-based products, such as fixed annuities and institutional products, is dependent
upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. When market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels, proceeds from investments that have
matured or have been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment spread. Lowering interest crediting rates on some products in such an environment can partially offset
decreases in investment yield. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the
timing or magnitude of changes in investment yields. Decreases in the interest crediting rates offered on products in the Allstate Financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading
to lower sales and/or changes in the level of policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals. Non-parallel shifts in interest rates, such as increases in short-term rates without
accompanying increases in medium- and long-term rates, can influence customer demand for fixed annuities, which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits. Increases
in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to increased
surrenders at a time when the segment's fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. This could lead to the sale of fixed income securities at a loss.
For certain products, principally fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life products, the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields. We may react to market conditions by increasing
crediting rates, which could narrow spreads and reduce profitability. Unanticipated surrenders could result in accelerated amortization of DAC or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase
expenses and reduce profitability. 
 Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment products may adversely affect our profitability and financial
condition through the amortization of DAC  
       DAC related to interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical
gross profits and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are investment returns, including
capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of persistency, mortality, expenses, and hedges if applicable. Updates
to these assumptions (commonly referred to as "DAC unlocking") could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. 
 Reducing our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements may adversely affect reported results  
       We have been reducing our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements. Lower new sales of these products could negatively
impact investment portfolio levels, complicate settlement of expiring contracts including forced sales of assets with unrealized capital losses, and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance
reserves deficiency testing. 
 Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and adversely affect our financial condition  
       Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable
tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider
legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress and various state legislatures also consider
proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance or annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the
taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material effect on
our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax
laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning.

 Risks Relating to Investments  
 We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely affect investment income, cause additional realized losses, and cause increased unrealized
losses  
       Although we continually reevaluate our return optimization and risk mitigation strategies, we remain subject to the risk that we will
incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. Adverse changes to these rates, spreads and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal
policy and the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants, or changes in market perceptions of credit
worthiness and/or risk tolerance. 
       We
are subject to risks associated with potential declines in credit quality related to specific issuers or specific industries and a general weakening in the economy, which are
typically reflected through credit spreads. Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury
securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. Credit spreads vary (i.e. increase or decrease) in response to the
market's perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector and are influenced by the credit ratings, and the reliability of those ratings, published by external rating agencies.
Although we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks, the effectiveness of such instruments is subject to the same risks. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a
result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could
cause additional realized and unrealized losses on securities, including realized and unrealized losses relating to equity and derivative strategies. 
       A
decline in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may earn less than the portfolio's
average yield. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also lead us to
purchase longer-term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market
interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority
of our investment portfolio. A declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease or decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected
benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other postretirement benefit plans to increase, either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the
pension plans and a reduction of shareholders' equity, increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans. 
 Deteriorating financial performance impacting securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgage loans, collateralized corporate loans, and commercial mortgage
loans may lead to write-downs and impact our results of operations and financial condition  
       Changes in residential or commercial mortgage delinquencies, loss severities or recovery rates, declining residential or commercial
real estate prices, corporate loan delinquencies or recovery rates, changes in credit or bond insurer strength ratings and the quality of service provided by service providers on securities in our
portfolios could lead us to determine that write-downs are necessary in the future. 
 The impact of our investment strategies may be adversely affected by developments in the financial markets  
       The impact of our investment portfolio return optimization and risk mitigation strategies may be adversely affected by unexpected
developments in the financial markets. For example, derivative contracts may result in coverage that is not as effective as intended thereby leading to the recognition of losses without the
recognition of gains expected to mitigate the losses. 
 Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition  
       The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries, geographic
sector or risk type could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition. Events or developments that have a negative impact
on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather
than diversified.

Table of Contents
 The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our investments is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and
financial condition  
       The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our
periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes
available. We update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in our results of operations. The assessment of whether
other-than-temporary impairments have occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. There
can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of or amounts recorded for other-than-temporary impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore,
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future. 
 The determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition  
       In determining fair values we generally utilize market transaction data for the same or similar instruments. The degree of management
judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information. The fair value of assets may differ from the actual amount received upon sale of
an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the assets' fair values. The
difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity DAC, certain deferred sales inducement costs ("DSI"), and certain reserves for
life-contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Changing market conditions could materially affect the
determination of the fair value of securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly. Determining fair value is subjective and could materially impact our operating
results and financial condition. 
 Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry  
 Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive  
       The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because some of our products include a
savings or investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have well-established national
reputations and market similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material effect on our business, operating results or financial
condition. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. Our ability to successfully operate
may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions, in developing the talent and skills of our human resources, in assimilating new executive talent into our
organization, or in deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals. 
 Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results and these conditions may not improve
in the near future  
       As with most businesses, we believe difficult conditions in the global capital markets and economy, such as significant negative
macroeconomic trends, including relatively high and sustained unemployment, reduced consumer spending, lower home prices, substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt, including defaults on
home mortgages, and the relatively low availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
       Stressed
conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio. Disruptions in
one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated, not all global financial markets are functioning
normally, and the rate of recovery from the U.S. recession has been below historic averages. Several governments around the world have announced austerity actions to address their budget deficits that
may lead to a decline in economic activity. Specifically, the global recession and disruption of the financial markets has led to concerns over capital markets access and the solvency of European
Union member states. 
       General
economic conditions could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure investment results. Consumer behavior changes could include decreased demand for our
products. For example, as consumers 
19



 
Table of Contents
purchase
fewer automobiles, our sales of auto insurance may decline. Also, as consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of auto and homeowners insurance. In addition, holders
of some of our
interest-sensitive life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds. Our investment results could be adversely affected as
deteriorating financial and business conditions affect the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio. 
 There can be no assurance that actions of the U.S. federal government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the
financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect  
       In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system, the financial markets and the broader economy in recent years, the
U.S. federal government, the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken actions such as purchasing mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions,
investing directly in banks, thrifts and bank and savings and loan holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy. There can be no assurance as to the long term impact such
actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions, including potential inflationary affects. Continued volatility and any further economic deterioration could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Losses from legal and regulatory actions may be material to our operating results, cash flows and financial condition  
       As is typical for a large company, we are involved in various legal actions, including class action litigation challenging a range of
company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. We are also involved in various regulatory actions and
inquiries, including market conduct exams by state insurance regulatory agencies. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of
amounts currently accrued and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition. The aggregate estimate of the range of
reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, disclosed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Actual results may
vary significantly from the current estimate. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth  
       As insurance companies, broker-dealers, investment advisers, a federal stock savings bank and/or investment companies, many of our
subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Changes may sometimes lead to additional expenses, increased legal exposure,
limit our ability to grow or to achieve targeted profitability. Moreover, laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, each of which exercises
a degree of interpretive latitude, including state insurance regulators; state securities administrators; state attorneys general and federal agencies including the SEC, the FINRA, the U.S. Department
of Justice, and until such time as Allstate Bank is dissolved and Allstate deregisters as a savings and loan holding company, the OCC, the FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").
Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's
interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement
authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement
authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our
practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit
the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of
insurance products, not holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our
business. 
 Regulatory reforms, and the more stringent application of existing regulations, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business  
       The federal government has enacted comprehensive regulatory reforms for financial services entities. As part of a larger effort to
strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, certain reforms are applicable to the insurance industry, including the FIO established within the Treasury Department. 
20



 
Table of Contents
       We
are a diversified unitary savings and loan holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the FDIC. The principal supervisory authorities for the
diversified unitary savings and loan holding company activities of The Allstate Corporation is the FRB, and the principal supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Allstate Corporation and
the Bank, respectively, are subject to FRB and OCC regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements and enforcement authority. The Bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC. 
       Among
other things, this permits one or more of these governmental entities to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness
and stability of Allstate Bank. In 2011, after receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased operations. In the first half of 2012, we expect to cancel the bank's charter
and deregister The Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding company. 
       In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny, members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance
companies, and FIO and the Federal Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC") were established. In the future, if the FSOC were to determine that Allstate is a "systemically important" nonbank financial
company, Allstate would again be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or
scope of insurance and financial regulation. 
       These
regulatory reforms and any additional legislative change or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government's regulatory reform of the financial
services industry or arising from reform related to the international regulatory capital framework for banking or financial services firms, and any
more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal authorities, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business, or limit our ability to grow or to achieve profitability. 
 Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business  
       Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to
catastrophes nationwide. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously
available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be
dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year. If we
were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to
either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives. 
 Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance, which could have a material
effect on our operating results and financial condition  
       The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market
conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments
under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism or ongoing military actions may have an adverse effect on the level of claim losses we incur, the value of our
investment portfolio, our competitive position, marketability of product offerings, liquidity and operating results  
       A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism, within the United States and abroad, or ongoing military and other actions,
and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest
rate changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment
portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued threat of terrorism. Additionally, in the Allstate
Protection and Allstate Financial segments, a large scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material effect on the sales, profitability, competitiveness, marketability of product offerings,
liquidity, and operating results.

 A downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity,
operating results and financial condition  
       Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an
effect on an insurance company's business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's
ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital; a change in a rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a
particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer's investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the
insurer's control. The insurance financial strength ratings of Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company and The Allstate Corporation's senior debt ratings from A.M. Best,
Standard & Poor's and Moody's are subject to continuous review, and the retention of current ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material effect on our
sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. 
 Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms  
       In periods of extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, liquidity and credit capacity may be severely
restricted. In such circumstances, our ability to obtain capital to fund operating expenses, financing costs, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited, and the cost of any such capital may
be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our
industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as lenders' perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired
if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in
such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. 
 We may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  
       Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is
evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value (attributed equity) of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Market declines or
other events impacting the fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill
impairment, resulting in a charge to income. Such a charge could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition  
       Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised,
interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions, which may have a
material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. For a description of changes in accounting standards that are
currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. 
 The change in our unrecognized tax benefit during the next 12 months is subject to uncertainty  
       We have disclosed our estimate of net unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonably possible increase or decrease in its balance during
the next 12 months in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. However, actual results may differ from our estimate for reasons such as changes in our position on specific
issues, developments with respect to the governments' interpretations of income tax laws or changes in judgment resulting from new information obtained in audits or the appeals process. 
 The realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty  
       The realization of our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, is based on our assumption that we will be able to fully
utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes. However, actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained.

 The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations  
       The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries.
State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive
pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make
dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect holding company liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our
debt, or complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected. 
 The occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning or a support failure from external providers during a disaster
could impair our ability to conduct business effectively  
       The occurrence of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, cyber attack, events
unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and
financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems. In the event that a significant number of our managers could
be unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised. 
 Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows  
       Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity
of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, and the results for our Allstate Protection segment. 
 Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees could affect our operations  
       We rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of
computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a
bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may suffer operational
impairments and financial losses.

       The payment of dividends by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts
based on statutory net income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2011, AIC
paid dividends of $838 million. Based on the greater of 2011 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that AIC will be able to pay without prior
Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2012 is $1.51 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification
and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and
statutory surplus.

(1)We
use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results. We believe that they enhance an investor's
understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the
impact of catastrophe losses. Expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
Combined ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income (loss) as a percentage of premiums earned, or
underwriting margin.

  OVERVIEW     
       The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of
The Allstate Corporation (referred to in this document as "we," "our," "us," the "Company" or "Allstate"). It should be read in conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected financial
data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in the
Property-Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in the Allstate Financial Segment sections of Management's Discussion and
Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. 
       Allstate
is focused on the following priorities in 2012:


maintain auto profitability; raise returns in homeowners and annuity businesses; grow insurance premiums; and proactively manage investments and capital. 

       The
most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include:


For Allstate Protection: premium written, the number of policies in force ("PIF"), retention, price changes, claim
frequency (rate of claim occurrence per policy in force) and severity (average cost per claim), catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting results, and sales of all products and services; For Allstate Financial: benefit and investment spread, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"),
expenses, operating income, net income, invested assets, and premiums and contract charges; For Investments: credit quality/experience, total return, investment income, cash flows,
realized capital gains and
losses, unrealized capital gains and losses, stability of long-term returns, and asset and liability duration; and For financial condition: liquidity, parent holding company level of
deployable invested assets, financial strength
ratings, operating leverage, debt leverage, book value per share, and return on equity. 


 Summary of Results:  

Consolidated net income was $788 million in 2011, a decrease of 15.1% compared to $928 million in 2010,
following an 8.7% increase in 2010 from $854 million in 2009. The decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to lower net income from Property-Liability, partially offset by higher net
income from Allstate Financial. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher net income from Allstate Financial, partially offset by lower net income from Property-Liability. Net
income per diluted share was $1.51, $1.71 and $1.58 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Allstate Protection had an underwriting loss of $849 million in 2011 compared to
underwriting income of
$526 million in 2010 and underwriting income of $1.03 billion in 2009. The decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in homeowners underwriting losses and
decreases in other personal lines and standard auto underwriting income. The decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to decreases in standard auto underwriting income and increases in
homeowners underwriting losses, partially offset by increases in other personal lines underwriting income. The Allstate Protection combined ratio was 103.3, 98.0 and 96.1 in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Underwriting income (loss), as measure not based on GAAP, is defined in the Property-Liability Operations section of the MD&A. Allstate Financial net income was
$586 million in 2011 compared to net income of $58 million in 2010 and a
net loss of $483 million in 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to net realized capital gains in the current year compared to net realized capital losses in the prior
year and decreased interest credited to contractholder funds, partially offset by higher amortization of DAC and lower net investment income. The favorable change of $541 million in 2010
compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower amortization of DAC, decreased interest credited to contractholder funds and higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment
income. 

 
 
  2011 HIGHLIGHTS     

Consolidated net income was $788 million in 2011 compared to $928 million in 2010. Net income per diluted
share was $1.51 in 2011 compared to $1.71 in 2010. Property-Liability net income was $408 million in 2011 compared to $1.05 billion in 2010.

  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES     
       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates include
those used in determining:


Fair value of financial assets Impairment of fixed income and equity securities Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation
Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation 

       In
making these determinations, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies,
estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. It is reasonably likely that changes in these
estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
       A
brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements, and the
judgments and assumptions related to these estimates, see the referenced sections of this document. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated
financial statements. 
       Fair value of financial assets    Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We categorize
our financial assets measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 













Level 1:
 
Financial asset values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that we can access.


 Level 2:
 
Financial asset values are based on the following:


 
 
(a)
 
Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets;


 
 
(b)
 
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; or


 
 
(c)
 
Valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset.


 Level 3:
 
Financial asset values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the
assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the financial assets.




       Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in valuing financial assets that are developed based on
market data obtained from independent sources. In the absence of sufficient observable inputs, unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in valuing
financial assets and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the
availability of market observable information. 
       We
are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. We gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and
consistent application of valuation input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through the execution of various processes and
controls designed to ensure that our financial assets are appropriately valued. We monitor fair values received from third parties and those derived internally on an ongoing basis. 
       We
employ independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values. We obtain or calculate only one single quote or price
for each financial instrument. 
       Valuation
service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce
valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements. For certain equity securities, valuation
service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date. For other security types, fair values are derived from the valuation service providers' proprietary
valuation models. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities,
interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, 
29



 
Table of Contents
liquidity
spreads, currency rates, and other information, as applicable. Credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities.
Valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value
the same financial instruments. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date, as described above, as well as the specific
attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information.
Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. In cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which
judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information. 
       For
certain of our financial assets measured at fair value, where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single non-binding
price quote from a broker familiar with the security who, similar to our valuation service providers, may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information. The brokers
providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making, underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to
valuation. 
       The
fair value of certain financial assets, including privately placed corporate fixed income securities, auction rate securities ("ARS") backed by student loans, equity-indexed notes,
and certain free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations, is determined using valuation methods and models
widely accepted in the financial services industry. Internally developed valuation models, which include inputs that may not be market observable and as such involve some degree of judgment, are
considered appropriate for each class of security to which they are applied. 
       Our
internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value. Our models generally incorporate
inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted market prices of comparable
securities, published credit spreads, and other applicable market data. Additional inputs that are used include internally-derived assumptions such as liquidity premiums and credit ratings, as well as
instrument-specific characteristics that include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions. Our internally assigned credit ratings are
developed at a more detailed level than externally published ratings and allow for a more precise match of these ratings to other market observable valuation inputs, such as credit and sector spreads,
when performing these valuations. Due to the existence of non-market observable inputs, such as liquidity premiums, judgment is required in developing these fair values. As a result, the
fair value of these financial assets may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of
different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets' fair values. 
       For
the majority of our financial assets measured at fair value, all significant inputs are based on market observable data and significant management judgment does not affect the
periodic determination of fair value. The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on market observable
data. However, where market observable data is
available, it takes precedence, and as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed. 
       There
is one primary situation where a discounted cash flow model utilizes a significant input that is not market observable, and it relates to the determination of fair value for our
ARS backed by student loans. The significant input utilized is the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market (that is, when auction failures will cease). Determination of this assumption
allows for matching to market observable inputs when performing these valuations. 
       The
following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in the anticipated date liquidity will return to the student loan ARS market as of December 31, 2011. The
selection of these hypothetical scenarios represents an illustration of the estimated potential proportional effect of alternate assumptions and should not be construed as either a prediction of
future events or an indication that it would be reasonably likely that all securities would be similarly affected.

       We believe our most significant exposure to changes in fair value is due to market risk. Our exposure to changes in market conditions is discussed
fully in the Market Risk section of the MD&A. 
       We
employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our financial assets. Our processes are designed to ensure that the values received or
internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate, consistently applied, and that the assumptions are reasonable and
consistent with the objective of determining fair value. For example, on a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual security values that have stale prices or that exceed certain
thresholds as compared to previous values received from those valuation service providers or derived from internal models. We perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes
and controls of our valuation service providers. In addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair value by comparing information obtained from our valuation service providers to other third
party valuation sources for selected securities. We perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal
pricing models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who
are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions. 
       We
also perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity, and if
so, whether transactions may not be orderly. Among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred
include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, bid-ask spread, and price consensuses
among market participants and sources. If evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair
value using an internal pricing model. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not alter fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal
pricing model for such securities.

hierarchy, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. 
        Impairment of fixed income and equity securities    For investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and
amortized
cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities, net of certain other items and deferred income taxes (as disclosed in Note 5), is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a
transaction with an unrelated third party or when a write-down is recorded due to an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose carrying
value may be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
       For
each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than
not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these
criteria, the security's decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings. 
       If
we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its
amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We use our best estimate of future cash flows expected
to be collected from the fixed income security, discounted at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss
exists. The 
31



 
Table of Contents
determination
of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to
the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts, are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows
expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, the financial condition
and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, geographic concentration, available reserves or escrows,
current subordination levels, third party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the
bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be
used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. If the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost
of the security, a credit loss exists and an other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings.
The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. If we determine that the fixed income security does not have
sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded
in earnings. 
       There
are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities and determining if they are other than temporary, including: 1) our ability
and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than
cost; 3) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic
location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 4) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which
could affect liquidity. 
       Once
assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed income or equity security is
other-than-temporarily impaired, including: 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a
particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual
obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances that result in changes to management's intent to sell or result in our assessment that it is more likely than not we will be required to
sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis of a fixed income security or causes a change in our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions,
facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income,
would not have a significant effect on shareholders' equity, since our securities are designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of
deferred income taxes and related DAC, deferred sales inducement costs ("DSI") and reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. 
       The
determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluation of the factors described
above. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in
other-than-temporary impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised. The use of different methodologies and assumptions in the determination of the amount
of other-than-temporary impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements. 
       For
additional detail on investment impairments, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements. 
        Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization    We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment
contracts.
In accordance with GAAP, costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position. 
       DAC
related to property-liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six or twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC related
to Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. 
       DAC
related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Significant
assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment returns, as well as mortality, persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time 
32



 
Table of Contents
the
policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. The assumptions for determining the timing and amount of DAC amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to
calculate the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and
any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated
lives of the policies. The recovery of DAC is dependent upon the future profitability of the business. We periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of DAC for these policies on
an aggregate basis using actual experience. We aggregate all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis. In the event actual experience is
significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a
premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining DAC balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments
were necessary, primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies. 
       DAC
related to interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, which
includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization is net of interest on
the prior period DAC balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts. Actual amortization periods generally range from 15-30 years; however, incorporating
estimates of the rate of customer surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the DAC being amortized during the surrender charge period, which is typically
10-20 years for interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for fixed annuities. The cumulative DAC amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or
credit to income when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total EGP. 
       AGP
and EGP primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits (benefit margin); investment income and
realized capital gains and losses less interest credited (investment margin); and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses (expense margin). The principal assumptions for
determining the amount of EGP are investment returns, including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of
persistency, mortality, expenses, and hedges if applicable, and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of DAC amortization. Changes in these assumptions can
be offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time. 
       Each
reporting period, DAC amortization is recognized in proportion to AGP for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period DAC balance. This amortization process includes an
assessment of AGP compared to EGP, the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability. The impact of realized
capital gains and losses on amortization of DAC depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss. If the AGP is greater than EGP in the period, but
the total EGP is unchanged, the amount of DAC amortization will generally increase, resulting in a current period decrease to earnings. The opposite result generally occurs when the AGP is less than
the EGP in the period, but the total EGP is unchanged. However, when DAC amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative (which would result in an increase
of the DAC balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for
recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Negative amortization is only recorded when the increased DAC balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances. Negative
amortization was not recorded for certain fixed annuities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 periods in which significant capital losses were realized on their related investment portfolio. For products
whose supporting investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of our expectations which may cause periodic AGP to become temporarily negative, EGP and AGP utilized in DAC amortization may be
modified to exclude the excess capital losses. 
       Annually,
we review and update all assumptions underlying the projections of EGP, including investment returns, comprising investment income and realized capital gains and losses,
interest crediting rates, persistency, mortality, expenses and the effect of any hedges. At each reporting period, we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine DAC amortization are
required. These reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration, which are commonly referred to as "DAC unlocking". If the update of assumptions causes total EGP to
increase, the rate of DAC amortization will generally decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. A decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total
EGP to decrease.

       Over the past three years, our most significant DAC assumption updates that resulted in a change to EGP and the amortization of DAC have been revisions to
expected future investment returns, primarily realized capital losses, mortality, expenses and the number of contracts in force or persistency. The following table provides the effect on DAC
amortization of changes in assumptions relating to the gross profit components of investment margin, benefit margin and expense margin during the years ended December 31.

       In 2011, DAC amortization deceleration related to changes in the investment margin component of EGP primarily related to equity-indexed annuities
and was due to an increase in projected investment margins. The deceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to increased projected persistency on interest-sensitive life insurance. The
acceleration related to expense margin primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected expenses. In 2010, DAC amortization deceleration related to
changes in the investment margin component of EGP primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to higher than previously projected investment income and lower interest credited,
partially offset by higher projected realized capital losses. The acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to lower projected renewal premium (which is also expected to reduce
persistency) on interest-sensitive life insurance, partially offset by higher than previously projected revenues associated with variable life insurance due to appreciation in the underlying separate
account valuations. The deceleration related to expense margin resulted from current and expected expense levels lower than previously projected. DAC amortization acceleration related to changes in
the investment margin component of EGP in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in 2009 and 2010. The deceleration related to
benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality. The acceleration related to expense margin resulted from current and expected expense levels higher than previously
projected.

       Any potential changes in assumptions discussed above are measured without consideration of correlation among assumptions. Therefore, it would be
inappropriate to add them together in an attempt to estimate overall variability in amortization. 
       For
additional detail related to DAC, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of this document. 
       Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation    Reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of
paying
claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued. Property-Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability insurance claims and claims
expense reserves. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the financial
statement date. 
        Characteristics of reserves    Reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of
business
based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims, less losses that have been paid. The significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and other lines for Allstate Protection, and
asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines for Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection's claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between
the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported. Auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle, while auto physical damage, homeowners property
and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year. Discontinued Lines and Coverages involve long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle. 
34



 
Table of Contents
       Reserves
are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date. Reserves are estimated for both reported and
unreported claims, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims. We update most of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes
available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates (reserve reestimates), which may be material, are determined by comparing
updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates, and the differences are recorded as property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the
period such changes are determined. Estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the
evaluation of numerous variables. 
        The actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates    Reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods
that
are variations on one primary actuarial technique. The actuarial technique is known as a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and
reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An
accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both
classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim
counts, paid losses, case reserves, and development factors calculated with this data. 
       In
the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A
three-year or two-year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of
each accident year into the next time period. The development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of
ultimate losses for each accident year. The implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development, as the significant size
of our experience data base achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process, the
implicit assumption being that a multi-year average development factor includes an adequate provision. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and
internal factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of
alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a
best estimate of ultimate losses. 
        How reserve estimates are established and updated    Reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level, and the results of these numerous
micro-level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate. For example, over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to
estimate losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major
states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. The actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for
specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process. Development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claim
counts reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. The calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends,
which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates. The historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve
estimates. 
       Often,
several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from
which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These micro-level estimates are not based on a single
set of assumptions. Actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro-level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves.
Moreover, this detailed micro-level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company-wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful. Based
on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are
summed to create the reserve balance carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
35



 
Table of Contents
       Reserves
are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year, by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors. This process
incorporates the historic and latest actual trends, and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates. New development factors are likely to differ from previous
development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results (claims reported or settled, losses paid, or changes to case reserves) occur differently than the implied assumptions
contained in the previous development factor calculations. If claims reported, paid losses, or case reserve changes are greater or less than the levels estimated by previous development factors,
reserve reestimates increase or decrease. When actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, a new reserve is
determined. The difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate and is recognized as an increase
or decrease in property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Property-liability reserve reestimates, after-tax, as a percent of
net income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 27.7%, 11.1%, and 8.5%, respectively. For Property-Liability, the 3-year average of reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a
favorable 1.2%, for Allstate Protection, the 3-year average of reserve estimates was a favorable 1.5% and for Discontinued Lines and Coverages, the 3-year average of reserve
reestimates was an unfavorable 1.3%, each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses. A more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is
presented in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document.

 Allstate Protection reserve estimates  
        Factors affecting reserve estimates    Reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously
described.
These estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends
involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic
conditions. When we experience changes of the type previously mentioned, we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of
the new trends, such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two-year, three-year, or
longer development periods to reestimate our reserves. For example, if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a
particular line of insurance in a specific state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific
estimate. Another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line, coverage, or state, actuarial
judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development. 
       As
claims are reported, for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity, the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost, based on their
assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim. For other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame, it is not practical or efficient to
set case reserves for each claim, and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on 
36



 
Table of Contents
estimation
techniques previously described. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and
other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. 
       Historically,
the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims. To provide for this, a development
reserve is estimated using previously described processes, and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves. Typically, the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about
90% of total reserves. 
       Another
major component of reserves is IBNR. Typically, IBNR comprises about 10% of total reserves. 
       Generally,
the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical
relationships to relevant inflation indicators, and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes previously described. Changes in auto current year claim severity are
generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by
medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in
average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Maintenance and Repair price index and the Parts and Equipment price index. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements
to the claim review and settlement process, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various other
loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends. 
       Changes
in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost
of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. We employ various loss management programs to
mitigate the effect of these factors. 
       As
loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility.
From that point in time and forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial
estimation processes. Statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year; however, when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner, they are
usually determined to be credible, and reserves are increased accordingly. 
       The
very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates, and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors, limits aggregate reserve level
testing for variability of data elements. However, by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types, comprising auto injury losses, auto
physical damage losses and homeowner losses, we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors, as described in
the section titled "Potential Reserve Estimate Variability" below. 
       Causes of reserve estimate uncertainty    Since reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred,
including
IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate. 
       At
each reporting date, the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding
accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or
settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries from accidents. During the
first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the
initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend
to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as
those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of
reserves for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10%
thereafter.

        Reserves for catastrophe losses    Property-Liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses.
Catastrophe
losses are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year
fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position. We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and
involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within
a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes,
earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any
period cannot be predicted. 
       The
estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our
estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously. However, depending on the nature of the
catastrophe, as noted above, the estimation process can be further complicated. For example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses,
limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind
driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, estimating additional living expenses, and assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous
other considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information
needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period. In these
situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe. As an example, in 2005 to complete an estimate
for certain areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff, or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive, we relied on
analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total PIF, as well as visual, governmental and third party information, including aerial photos, area observations, and data on wind speed and
flood depth to the extent available. 
        Potential reserve estimate variability    The aggregation of numerous micro-level estimates for each business segment, line of insurance, major
components of losses (such as coverages and perils), and major states or groups of states for reported losses and IBNR forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. Because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates, there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level. Given the
numerous micro-level estimates for reported losses and IBNR, management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that
would be meaningful. Reserve estimates, by their very nature, are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim.
Accordingly, as actual claims, and/or paid losses, and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated. 
       To
develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the
countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses, auto physical damage losses, and homeowners losses excluding
catastrophe losses. Based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements, an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these
reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twenty years for each type of loss. The variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean (a
measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability.
Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve
estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, excluding reserves for catastrophe losses, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be
approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $450 million in net income. A lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses, which comprise approximately 75% of reserves, due to
their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims. Other types of losses, such as auto physical damage, homeowners losses and other losses, which
comprise about 25% of reserves, tend to have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time. Although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it is possible the
final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document.

Table of Contents
        Adequacy of reserve estimates    We believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available
methodology,
facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components
(coverages and perils) and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses, and as a result we believe
that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best
estimates. 
 Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserve estimates  
       Characteristics of Discontinued Lines exposure    We continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to
bodily
injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. 
       Our
exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the
mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large U.S. companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general
liability coverages on large U.S. companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Other discontinued lines
exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. 
       In
1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property-liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage
for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General
liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these
policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. 
       Our
exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct
excess insurance or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in
nature. 
       Direct
excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and
reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by
the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business. 
       Our
assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers' reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion
of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15%
is for pro-rata coverage. 
       Our
direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many
diverse business sectors located throughout the country. 
        How reserve estimates are established and updated    We conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos,
environmental
and other discontinued lines reserves. Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no
change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim
activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the
characteristics of exposure (i.e. environmental damages, respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution and related
clean-up costs. The number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy
protection as a result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims, often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements
occur. 
       After
evaluating our insureds' probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, we evaluate our insureds' coverage programs for such claims. We consider our insureds' total
available insurance coverage, including the 
39



 
Table of Contents
coverage
we issued. We also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any. 
       Evaluation
of both the insureds' estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This
analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel. Based on these evaluations, case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is
employed to develop an IBNR reserve, which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, IBNR was
59.0% and 60.1%, respectively, of combined asbestos and environmental reserves. 
       For
both asbestos and environmental reserves, we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or
characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity. 
        Other Discontinued Lines and Coverages    The following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which
provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, as of December 31.

       Other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and
environmental. Workers' compensation and commercial and other include run-off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various
coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual
coverage exposures. 
       Potential reserve estimate variability    Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other
discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those
presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and
unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs' evolving and expanding
theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance; retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any
contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning
the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined
premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide
coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and
whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other
potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance
that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We
believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves.
Historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document. 
       Adequacy of reserve estimates    Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are
appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential
liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Due to the
uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.

        Further discussion of reserve estimates    For further discussion of these estimates and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates,
reserve
reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 8 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document. 
        Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation    Due to the long term nature of traditional life insurance,
life-contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and health products, benefits are payable over many years; accordingly, the reserves are calculated as the present value of
future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums. Long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy
terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under these insurance policies. These assumptions, which for traditional life
insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration.
Future investment yield assumptions are determined
based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience. Expense
assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-paying period. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued, are consistent
with assumptions for determining DAC amortization for these policies, and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period. However, if actual experience emerges in a manner that is
significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions, adjustments to DAC or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material effect on our operating results
and financial condition. We periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of DAC for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience. In the event actual experience is
significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the
establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary, primarily due to profit from
traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies. We will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and
immediate annuities. We anticipate that mortality, investment and reinvestment yields, and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require premium deficiency adjustments to
these reserves or related DAC.

  PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS     
        Overview    Our Property-Liability operations consist of two reporting segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages.
Allstate
Protection comprises three brands: Allstate, Encompass and Esurance. Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger
auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain
commercial and other businesses in run-off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the
allocation of resources. 
       Underwriting
income (loss), a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income (loss) below, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"),
amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the
profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the
components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to underwriting income (loss). Underwriting income
(loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. 
       The
table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as
follows:

Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio  the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned.
Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses. Expense ratio  the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and
related charges to premiums earned. 
42



 
Table of Contents

Combined ratio  the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and
expenses, and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents
underwriting income (loss) as a percentage of premiums earned, or underwriting margin. 
       We
have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods. 

Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio  the percentage of catastrophe losses included in
claims and claims expense to premiums earned. This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses. Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined
ratio  the percentage of prior year reserve
reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses. Effect of business combination expenses
and the amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined and expense
ratio  the percentage of business combination expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned. Effect of restructuring and related charges on
combined ratio  the percentage of restructuring and
related charges to premiums earned. Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio  the ratio of claims and claims expense
and operating costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio
and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.

  ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT     
        Overview and strategy    The Allstate Protection segment primarily sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through
Allstate
exclusive agencies and directly through call centers and the internet under the Allstate brand. We sell auto and homeowners insurance through independent agencies under both the Allstate brand and the
Encompass brand. We also sell auto insurance direct to consumers online, through a call center and through select agents, including Answer Financial, under the Esurance brand. 
       Our
strategy is to position our products and distribution systems to meet the changing needs of the customer in managing the risks they face. This includes customers who want advice and
assistance and those who are self-directed. In addition, there are customers who are brand-sensitive and those who are brand-neutral. Our strategy is to serve all 
44



 
Table of Contents
four
of these sectors with unique products and in unique and innovative ways while leveraging our claims, pricing and operational capabilities. When we do not offer a product our customers need, we
may offer non-proprietary products that meet their needs. 
       Our
operating priorities for the Protection segment include achieving profitable market share growth for our auto business as well as earning acceptable returns on our homeowners
business. Key goals include:

Improving customer loyalty and retention; 
Deepening customer product relationships; 
Improving auto competitive position through price optimization; 
Improving the profitability of our homeowners business; 
Investing in the effectiveness and reach of our multiple distribution channels including self-directed
consumers through our newly acquired Esurance brand; and 
Maintaining a strong capital foundation through risk management and effective resource allocation. 
       Our
customer-focused strategy for the Allstate brand aligns targeted marketing, product innovation, distribution effectiveness, and pricing toward acquiring and retaining an increased
share of our target customers, which
generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including auto, homeowners and financial products, who have better retention and potentially present
more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. 
       The
Allstate brand utilizes marketing delivered to target customers to promote our strategic priorities, with messaging that continues to communicate affordability and ease of doing
business with Allstate, as well as the importance of having proper coverage by highlighting our comprehensive product and coverage options. 
       At
Allstate we differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features as well as product customization, including Allstate
Your Choice Auto® with options such as accident forgiveness, safe driving deductible rewards and a safe driving bonus. We will continue to focus on developing and introducing products and
services that benefit today's consumers and further differentiate Allstate and enhance the customer experience. We will deepen customer relationships through value-added customer interactions and
expanding our presence in households with multiple products by providing financial protection for customer needs. In addition, we introduced a claim satisfaction guarantee that promises a return of
premium to any Allstate Brand standard auto insurance customer dissatisfied with their claims experience, which differentiates Allstate from the competition. 
       Within
our multiple distribution channels we are undergoing a focused effort to enhance our capabilities by implementing uniform processes and standards to elevate the level and
consistency of our customer experience. We continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and
reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by
increasing the productivity of the Allstate brand's exclusive agencies. Beginning in 2012, Allstate Brand direct sales and service will focus on serving customers who prefer personal advice and
assistance and work closer with Allstate exclusive agencies. 
       Our
pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions, made in conjunction within a program called Strategic Risk Management, are designed to enhance both our competitive position and
our profit potential. Pricing sophistication, which underlies our Strategic Risk Management program, uses a number of risk evaluation factors including insurance scoring, to the extent permissible by
regulations, based on information that is obtained from credit reports. Our updated auto risk evaluation pricing model was implemented for 25 states in 2011 and these implementations will continue in
other states throughout 2012. Our pricing strategy involves marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions that are based on these risk evaluation models and an evaluation of competitors. We will
utilize pricing sophistication to increase our price competiveness to a greater share of target customers. We call this price optimization and it includes using underwriting information, pricing and
discounts to achieve a higher close rate. 
       We
will also continue to provide a range of discounts to attract more target customers. For the Allstate brand auto and homeowners business, we continue to improve our mix of customers
towards those customers that have better retention and thus potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. For homeowners, we will
address rate adequacy and improve underwriting and claim effectiveness. Our comprehensive strategic review of our homeowners insurance business is ongoing.

Table of Contents
       The
Allstate Protection segment also includes a separate organization called Emerging Businesses which comprises Business Insurance (commercial products for small business owners),
Consumer Household (specialty products including motorcycle, boat, renters and condominium insurance policies), Allstate Dealer Services (insurance and non-insurance products sold
primarily to auto dealers), Allstate Roadside Services (retail and wholesale roadside assistance products) and Ivantage (insurance agency). Premiums written by Emerging Businesses were
$2.49 billion in 2011 compared to $2.43 billion in 2010. We expect we will continue to accelerate profitable growth in Emerging Businesses during 2012. 
       Our
strategy for the Encompass brand includes enhancing our premier package policy (providing customers with the ability to simplify their insurance needs by consolidating their coverage
into one policy, with one bill, one premium and one renewal date) to appeal to customers with broad personal lines coverage needs and that value an independent agent. Additionally, Encompass is
focused on increasing distribution effectiveness and improving agency technology interfaces to become the package carrier of choice for aligned agencies to generate stable, consistent earnings growth. 
       Our
strategy for Esurance brand focuses on self-directed and web-savvy customers. To best serve these customers, Esurance develops its technology and website to
continuously improve its hassle-free purchase and claims experience. In 2012, Esurance plans to broaden its product offering and increase its preferred driver mix, while raising its
advertising investment and marketing effectiveness to support growth. 
       We
continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the
variability of our earnings. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property lines. As of December 31, 2011, we continue to be within our goal to have
no more than a 1% likelihood of exceeding annual aggregate catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of reinsurance, from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled assumptions and applications
currently available. The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss. 
       Property
catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes and
other catastrophes. We are also working for changes in the regulatory environment, including recognizing the need for better catastrophe preparedness, improving appropriate risk based pricing and
promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions for mega-catastrophes that will make insurance more available and affordable. While the actions that we take will
be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business, we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines. 
       Pricing
of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long-term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and
weather-related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore,
in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance
relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products' pricing. We pursue rate increases where indicated using a newly re-designed methodology that appropriately addresses the
changing costs of losses from catastrophes such as severe weather and the net cost of reinsurance. 
 Allstate Protection outlook  

Allstate Protection will continue to focus on its strategy of offering differentiated products and services to our target
customers while maintaining pricing discipline. 
We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting
results; however, this volatility will be mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions, including the purchase of reinsurance. 
We will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be
reduced. 
       Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a
GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the
unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since policy periods are typically 6 or 12 months, rate changes will
generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months.

       Premium operating measures and statistics that are used to analyze the business are calculated and described below. Measures and statistics
presented for Allstate brand exclude Allstate Canada, loan protection and specialty auto. 

PIF:    Policy counts are based on items rather than customers. A multi-car customer would generate
multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were insured under one policy. Average premium-gross written:    Gross premiums written divided by issued item count.
Gross premiums written
include the impacts from discounts and surcharges, and exclude the impacts from mid-term premium adjustments, ceded reinsurance premiums, and premium refund accruals. Allstate brand
average gross premiums represent the appropriate policy term for each line, which is 6 months for standard and non-standard auto and 12 months for homeowners. Encompass brand
average gross premiums represent the appropriate policy term for each line, which is 12 months for standard auto and homeowners and 6 months for non-standard auto. Esurance
brand average gross premiums represent the appropriate policy term, which is 6 months for standard auto. Renewal ratio:    Renewal policies issued during the
period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the
total policies issued 6 months prior for standard and non-standard auto (12 months prior for Encompass brand standard auto) or 12 months prior for homeowners. New issued
applications:    Item counts of automobiles or homeowners insurance applications for insurance
policies that were issued during the period. Does not include automobiles that are added by existing customers. Net items added to existing policies:    Net increases
in insured cars by policy endorsement activity. 
       Standard auto premiums written total of $16.49 billion in 2011 was comparable to 2010, following a 0.5% decrease in 2010 from
$16.56 billion in 2009.

       Allstate brand standard auto premiums written totaled $15.70 billion in 2011, a decrease of 0.9% from $15.84 billion in 2010,
following a 0.5% increase in 2010 from $15.76 billion in 2009. Contributing to the Allstate brand standard auto premiums written decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 were the
following:


decrease in PIF of 1.5% as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010, due to fewer new issued
applications and fewer policies available to renew. Excluding Florida and New York, PIF as of December 31, 2011 were comparable to December 31, 2010. 5.8% decrease in new
issued applications on a countrywide basis to 1,908 thousand in 2011 from
2,025 thousand in 2010. Excluding Florida and New York (impacted by actions to improve profitability), new issued applications on a countrywide basis decreased 0.1% to 1,697 thousand in

       Allstate
brand standard auto premiums written increased in 2010 compared to 2009. Contributing to the Allstate brand standard auto premiums written increase in 2010 compared to 2009 were
the following:


decrease in PIF as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009, due to fewer policies available to
renew and a 0.7% decrease in net items added to existing policies to 1,498 thousand from 1,509 thousand, reflecting industry economic trends for declines in the number of cars per
household 0.2% decrease in new issued applications on a countrywide basis to 2,025 thousand in 2010 from
2,029 thousand in 2009 impacted by decreases in Florida and California, due in part to rate actions that were approved in 2009 in these markets and other actions to improve profitability.
Excluding Florida and California, new issued applications on a countrywide basis increased 12.9% to 1,606 thousand in 2010 from 1,423 thousand in 2009. New issued application increased
in 40 states in 2010 compared to 2009, most of which offer an auto discount (the Preferred Package Discount) for our target customer. increased average gross premium in 2010 compared to
2009, primarily due to rate changes, partially offset by customers
electing to lower coverage levels of their policy 0.2 point decrease in the renewal ratio in 2010 compared to 2009, reflects profit management actions in California, New
York and Georgia as well as the effects of the direct channel which has a lower renewal ratio. Excluding these items the renewal ratio had a 0.3 point increase. 

       The
level of Encompass premiums written continues to be impacted by comprehensive actions designed to reposition Encompass as the package policy carrier of choice for above middle market
customers through independent agencies in order to drive stable, consistent earnings growth over time. Some of the actions contributing to the Encompass brand standard auto premiums written decrease
in 2011 compared to 2010 were the following:


Aligned pricing and underwriting with strategic direction Terminated relationships with certain independent agencies
Non-renewal of underperforming business Discontinued writing the Special Value product (middle market auto product focused
on segment auto) and Deerbrook
(non-standard auto) in certain states Non-renewal of property in Florida 

       Non-standard auto premiums written totaled $776 million in 2011, a decrease of 12.7% from $889 million in 2010,

       We
have different plans around the country to improve the growth and profitability of our homeowners business. In states where we offer homeowners and other property coverages that do
not have severe weather issues and that have acceptable returns, we are seeking to grow. In another group of states where we offer homeowners and other property coverages, we plan to implement pricing
and/or underwriting actions that will improve performance to achieve our profitability targets. For two other groups of states, including those with severe weather issues and other risks such as
hurricane exposure, we may take more substantial actions including raising prices, offering policies with more limited coverage, or brokering to other carriers. We are currently piloting our Allstate
House and HomeSM product which provides greater options of coverage for roof damage including depreciated value versus replacement value and uses a number of factors to determine price,
some of which relate to auto insurance risks. We expect to roll it out countrywide for new business gradually over the next three years.

       Allstate Protection experienced an underwriting loss of $849 million in 2011 compared to underwriting income of $526 million in
2010, primarily due to an increase in homeowners underwriting loss, an underwriting loss for other
personal lines compared to an underwriting gain in the prior year, and a decrease in standard auto underwriting income. Homeowners underwriting loss increased $995 million to
$1.33 billion in 2011 from $335 million in 2010, primarily due to increases in catastrophe losses and higher expenses partially offset by average earned premiums increasing faster than
loss costs. Other personal lines underwriting income decreased $283 million to an underwriting loss of $188 million in 2011 from underwriting income of $95 million in 2010,
primarily due to increases in catastrophe losses, unfavorable reserve reestimates and higher expenses. Standard auto underwriting income decreased $124 million to

in 2011 from $692 million in 2010, primarily due to increases in catastrophe losses and higher expenses, partially offset by favorable reserve reestimates. For further

sections of the MD&A. 
       Allstate
Protection experienced underwriting income of $526 million in 2010 compared to $1.03 billion in 2009, primarily due to decreases in standard auto underwriting
income and increases in homeowners underwriting losses, partially offset by increases in other personal lines underwriting income. Standard auto underwriting income decreased 29.9% to an underwriting
income of $692 million in 2010 from an underwriting income of $987 million in 2009 primarily due to increases in auto claim frequency and expenses and a $25 million litigation
settlement, partially offset by favorable reserve reestimates and decreases in catastrophe losses. Homeowners underwriting loss increased $210 million to an underwriting loss of
$335 million in 2010 from an underwriting loss of $125 million in 2009 primarily due to a $75 million unfavorable prior year reserve reestimate related to a litigation settlement
and increases in expenses and catastrophe losses, including prior year reestimates for catastrophes, partially offset by average earned premiums increasing faster than loss costs. Other personal lines
underwriting income increased 6.7% to an underwriting income of $95 million in 2010 from an underwriting income of $89 million in 2009 primarily due to lower unfavorable reserve
reestimates. 
       Catastrophe losses were $3.82 billion in 2011 as detailed in the table below. This compares to catastrophe losses of
$2.21 billion in 2010. 
       We
define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an
event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.
Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to
man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.

(1)Ratios
are calculated using the premiums earned for the respective line of business. 

       Standard auto loss ratio for the Allstate brand decreased 0.1 points in 2011 compared to 2010
primarily due to favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, the Allstate brand standard auto loss ratio improved 1.7
points in 2011 compared 2010. Florida and New York continued to have loss ratios higher than the countrywide average in 2011 though results in these two key states have improved relative to 2010,
reducing the pressure on countrywide results. However, Florida and New York have improved underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2011. We continue to pursue profitability management actions in
Florida and New York, including rate increases, underwriting restrictions, increased claims staffing and review, and continued advocacy for legislative reform. In 2011, claim frequencies in the bodily
injury and physical damage coverages have decreased compared to 2010. Bodily injury and physical damage coverages severity results in 2011 increased in line with historical Consumer Price Index
("CPI") trends. Standard auto loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 1.4 points in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher claim frequency and a $25 million litigation settlement, partially
offset by 
53



 
Table of Contents
favorable
reserve reestimates and lower catastrophe losses. The increase is primarily driven by increases in Florida and New York. In 2010, claim frequencies in the bodily injury and physical damage
coverages have increased compared to 2009, but remain within historical norms. Bodily injury and physical damage coverages severity results in 2010 increased in line with historical CPI trends. 
       Homeowners loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 15.9 points to 98.0 in 2011 from 82.1 in 2010 due to higher catastrophe losses.
Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, the Allstate brand homeowners loss ratio improved 2.8 points in 2011 compared to 2010 due to average earned premiums increasing faster than loss costs.
Homeowners loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 2.5 points to 82.1 in 2010 from 79.6 in 2009 due to a $75 million unfavorable prior year reserve reestimate related to a litigation
settlement and higher catastrophe losses including prior year reserve reestimates for catastrophes, partially offset by average earned premiums increasing faster than loss costs. 
       Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased 0.6 points in 2011 compared to 2010. Restructuring costs increased 0.1 points in 2011
compared to 2010, driven by technology and operations efficiency efforts and agent pension plan settlement charges. Excluding restructuring, the expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased 0.5
points in 2011 compared to 2010, driven by additional marketing, including $78 million spent on the Grow to Win initiative, and other growth initiative costs, and reduced guaranty fund accrual
levels in 2010. We expect advertising costs to increase in 2012 as we focus on growing Esurance. The expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased 0.5 points in 2010 compared to 2009. Restructuring
costs decreased 0.3 points in 2010 compared to 2009, driven by prior year costs associated with claim office consolidations, reorganization of Business Insurance and technology prioritization and
efficiency efforts. Excluding restructuring, the expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased 0.8 points in 2010 compared to 2009, driven by additional marketing expenses and increases in net costs
of employee benefits, partially offset by reduced guaranty fund accrual levels and improved operational efficiencies. 
       The
impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio are included in the following table.

       The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximates the total Allstate Protection expense ratio. The expense
ratio for the non-standard auto business generally is lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for
non-standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Encompass brand DAC amortization is higher on average than Allstate brand DAC amortization due to higher commission rates. The Esurance
brand expense ratio is higher than Allstate and Encompass brands due to business combination expenses and amortization of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets will be amortized on
an accelerated basis with over 80% of the amortization taking place by 2016. Since Esurance uses a direct distribution model, its primary acquisition-related costs are advertising as opposed to
commissions for the Allstate and Encompass brands. Advertising expense had a 10.9 point impact on the Esurance brand expense ratio in 2011. Advertising costs are not capitalized as DAC while
commission costs are capitalized as DAC. As a result the Esurance expense and combined ratios will be higher during periods of growth since the expenses will be recognized prior to the premium earned. 
       DAC    We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents' remuneration,
premium
taxes and inspection costs. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to

$21 million of present value of future profits, which will be fully amortized by March 31, 2012. 

       On January 1, 2012, we will adopt new DAC accounting guidance on a retrospective basis (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial
statements for further details). It is currently estimated that the restated Allstate Protection DAC balance will decline by $63 million when compared to the reported December 31, 2011
balance. We estimate that the new DAC accounting guidance will have an insignificant effect on net income in 2012. 
 Catastrophe management  
       Historical catastrophe experience    Since the beginning of 1992, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property-Liability loss ratio
was 8.0
points. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, it is useful to consider the
impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF") or placed
with a third party, such as hurricane coverage in Hawaii. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California earthquakes, on
our Property-Liability loss ratio was 7.0 points since the beginning of 1992. 
       Comparatively,
the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years 1992 through 2011 is shown in the following table.

       Over time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high
levels of natural catastrophes. Limitations include our participation in various state facilities, such as the CEA, which provides insurance for California earthquake losses; the FHCF, which provides
reimbursements to participating insurers for certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses; and other state facilities, such as wind pools. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the
growth in insured values, and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint
underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our participation in these
and other state facilities such as wind pools, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities. 
       We
continue to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, including the
following:

Selectively not offering continuing coverage of mono-line homeowners policies in coastal areas of certain
states. Increased capacity in our brokerage platform for customers not offered a renewal. 
55




 











Table of Contents 

Expanded our excess and surplus carrier (North Light Specialty) to eight new states in 2011, bringing the total number of
active states to 25. In Texas we are ceding wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas along the coast
including the Galveston Islands. We have ceased writing new homeowners business in California. We will continue to renew current policyholders and have a
renewal ratio of approximately 91% in California. We have ceased writing new business in Florida beyond a modest stance for existing customers who replace their
currently-insured home with an acceptable property. Withdrawal from the property lines was completed for the Encompass companies operating in Florida. 
 Hurricanes  
       We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties
along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Usually, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than in other areas. However, average premiums are often not
considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss. In addition and as explained in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, in various states Allstate is subject to assessments
from assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations providing insurance for wind related property losses. 
       We
have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in
areas most exposed to hurricanes; limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states; implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate; and
not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states. We continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. This may require further actions, similar to
those already taken, in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where we achieve adequate returns and do
not materially increase our hurricane risk. 
 Earthquakes  
       Actions taken to reduce our exposure from earthquake coverage are substantially complete. These actions included purchasing reinsurance
on a countrywide basis and in the state of Kentucky; no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states; removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states; and entering
into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business. 
       We
expect to retain approximately 30,000 PIF with earthquake coverage due to regulatory and other reasons. We also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies
that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto policies, and to fires following earthquakes. Allstate policyholders in the state of California are offered coverage
through the CEA, a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Allstate is subject to assessments from the CEA under certain
circumstances as explained in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. 
 Fires Following Earthquakes  
       Actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in
California, purchasing reinsurance for Kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding Florida and New Jersey. 
 Wildfires  
       Actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states
and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance. Catastrophe losses related to the Southern California wildfires occurred during 2009 and totaled $76 million. 
 Reinsurance  
       A description of our current catastrophe reinsurance program appears in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements and a
description of program changes as of June 1, 2012 appears in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.

  DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT     
        Overview    The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for
certain
commercial and other businesses in run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. We have assigned management of this
segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy
coverage interpretation, exposure identification and reinsurance collection. As part of its responsibilities, this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance
assumed and ceded commutations.

       Underwriting losses of $25 million in 2011 related to a $26 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves and a
$5 million unfavorable reestimate of other reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices, partially offset by a $26 million
decrease of our allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance and environmental reserves essentially unchanged. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $11 million in 2011 and
$13 million for each of 2010 and 2009. 
       Underwriting
losses of $31 million in 2010 related to an $18 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $5 million unfavorable reestimate of
asbestos reserves, partially offset by a $4 million favorable reestimate of other reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices. 
       Underwriting
losses of $32 million in 2009 were primarily related to a $13 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $28 million unfavorable
reestimate of other reserves, partially offset by an $8 million favorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial
best practices. 
       See
the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A for a more detailed discussion. 
 Discontinued Lines and Coverages outlook  

We may continue to experience asbestos and/or environmental losses in the future. These losses could be due to the
potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial
and regulatory actions. Environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup. Because of our annual review, we believe that our reserves are
appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. 
We continue to be encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity has slowed, perhaps reflecting various
state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims. 
 
 
  PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS     
       Net investment income increased 1.0% or $12 million to $1.20 billion in
2011 from $1.19 billion in 2010, after decreasing 10.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2011 increase was primarily due to higher yields, partially offset by lower average investment balances.
The 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower yields and duration shortening actions taken to protect the portfolio from rising interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. 
       The
following table presents the average pre-tax investment yields for the years ended December 31. Pre-tax yield is calculated as investment income

  PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES     
       Property-Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability claims and claims expense
reserves. For a description of our reserve process, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in
our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR
claims, as of the reporting date. 
       The
facts and circumstances leading to our reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a
reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve
estimates. As of December 31, 2011, the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately
$116 million in net income. 
       The
table below shows total net reserves as of December 31 by line of business.

       Auto reserve reestimates in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to claim severity development that was better than expected. 2010 was also
impacted by a litigation settlement. 
       Favorable
homeowners reserve reestimates in 2011 were primarily due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates. Favorable homeowners reserve reestimates in 2010 were primarily due to

       Allstate brand prior year reserve reestimates were $371 million favorable in 2011,
$181 million favorable in 2010 and $126 million favorable in 2009. In 2011, this was primarily due to severity development that was better than expected and favorable catastrophe reserve
reestimates. The increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. In 2010, this was primarily due to
favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates and severity development that was better than expected, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 &
prior is due to the litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. In 2009, this was primarily due to favorable reserve
reestimates from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and a catastrophe related subrogation recovery. The shift of reserves to older accident years is attributable to a
reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury reserves to older years. 
       These
trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting
period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are
revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations.

        Discontinued Lines and Coverages    We conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos,
environmental and
other discontinued lines reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the
regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential
liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by policyholders. 
       Reserve
reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2011, environmental in 2010 and other discontinued
lines in 2009.

       Reserve additions for asbestos in 2011 totaling $26 million were primarily for products related coverage due to increases for the assumed
reinsurance portion of discontinued lines where we are reliant on our ceding companies to report claims. Reserve additions for asbestos in 2010 totaling $5 million were primarily for products
related coverage. Asbestos reserves reestimates in 2009 were $8 million favorable. 
       Normal
environmental claim activity resulted in essentially no change in estimated reserves for 2011. The reserve additions for environmental in 2010 and 2009 were primarily related to
site-specific remediations where the clean-up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean-up were more fully determined. IBNR now represents 64% of total net
environmental reserves, 2 points higher than as of December 31, 2010.

       The
survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to
measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount
of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to
vary over time. The 2009 net survival ratios in the table above have been adjusted to remove the claims and claims expense paid of $63 million for asbestos and $7 million for
environmental attributable to commutation activity related to three reinsurers. 
       In
2011, the asbestos net 3-year survival ratio increased due to lower average annual payments. In 2010, the asbestos net 3-year survival ratio decreased due to
lower reserve levels as the result of
loss settlements. The environmental net 3-year survival ratio increased in both 2011 and 2010 due to lower average annual payments.

       During the last three years, 57 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and claims of 75 policyholders were closed,
decreasing the number of active policyholders by 18 during the period. The 18 decrease
comprised (4) from 2011, 1 from 2010 and (15) from 2009. The decrease of 4 from 2011 included 16 new policyholders reporting new claims and the closing of 20 policyholders' claims. 
       IBNR
net reserves decreased by $30 million. As of December 31, 2011 IBNR represented 58% of total net asbestos reserves, compared to 60% as of December 31, 2010.
IBNR provides for reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new policyholders and ceding companies.

        Property-Liability reinsurance ceded    For Allstate Protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage
capital, and
to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Castle Key Insurance Company and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company. We
purchase significant reinsurance to manage our aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable level. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the
purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. We also participate in various
reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, which are backed by the financial resources of the property-liability insurance company market participants, and have historically
purchased reinsurance to mitigate long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for
all risks ceded to reinsurers.

       Reinsurance
recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance
agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. We calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement, including an estimate of how
IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement. We also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, our estimate of reinsurance
recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established;
however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts
recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. The establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. 
       The
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $103 million and $142 million as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This amount represents 13.4% and 17.6% of the related reinsurance recoverable balances as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors. In addition, in the ordinary course
of business, we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the
parties' rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. We employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. We also consider recent developments in
commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance
recoveries. 
       Adverse
developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future
claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer
companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated
capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance
recoverables in the future.

       For
the year ended December 31, 2011, ceded property-liability premiums earned increased $6 million when compared to prior year, primarily due to higher premium rates and
an increase in policies written for the National Flood Insurance Program. For the year ended December 31, 2010, ceded property-liability premiums earned increased $36 million when
compared to prior year, primarily due to the adoption of accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which resulted in the consolidation of two insurance company
affiliates, Allstate Texas Lloyds and Allstate County Mutual Insurance Company. 
66



 
Table of Contents
       Ceded
property-liability claims and claims expense increased in 2011 primarily due to reserve increases in the MCCA program and an increase in claim activity on the National Flood
Insurance Program due to multiple flooding events throughout the year. Ceded property-liability claims and claims expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to amounts ceded to National Flood Insurance
Program. 
       For
a detailed description of the MCCA, FHCF and Lloyd's, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, other than the recoverable balances
listed in the table above, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property-Liability reinsurer was in excess of $19 million. 
       We
enter into certain intercompany insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property-Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among
various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

       Our catastrophe reinsurance program is designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes
nationwide. Our program provides reinsurance protection for catastrophes including storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, fires following earthquakes, earthquakes and wildfires
including California wildfires. These reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in
our property business, and to reduce variability of earnings, while providing protection to our customers. 
       We
anticipate completing the placement of our 2012 catastrophe reinsurance program in February 2012. We expect the program will be substantially similar to our 2011 catastrophe
reinsurance program. The information below provides further detail regarding our 2012 catastrophe reinsurance program. 
       Our
2012 reinsurance program will continue to support our goal to have no more than a 1% likelihood of exceeding annual aggregate catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of
reinsurance, from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available. Since the 2006 inception of Allstate's catastrophe reinsurance program, our exposure to
wind loss has been materially reduced and we have nearly eliminated our exposure to earthquake loss. Similar to our 2011 program, we have designed our 2012 program to respond to these exposure changes
by including coverage for multiple perils, in addition to hurricanes and earthquakes, in all agreements except for the Kentucky agreement, which provides coverage for earthquakes and fires following
earthquakes. 
       The
2012 program, as described below, is expected to provide $3.25 billion of reinsurance coverage above the retention. Similar to the expiring program, the 2012 program will
include a Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement reinsuring our personal lines property and auto excess catastrophe losses resulting from multiple perils in every state other than New
Jersey and Florida. For June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, it is anticipated the program will consist of two agreements: a Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement providing
coverage in six layers with the reinstatement of limits available for the First through Fifth Layers, and a Top and Drop Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement which includes Coverage A and
Coverage B. 
       The
Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides an initial $3.25 billion per occurrence limit in excess of a $500 million retention and after the
Company has incurred $250 million in losses "otherwise recoverable." The $250 million in losses otherwise recoverable applies once each contract year to the First Layer only and losses
from multiple qualifying occurrences can apply to this $250 million threshold in excess of $500 million per occurrence. For June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, the program will
consist of two existing contracts which expire May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2014 and three new contracts which expire May 31, 2013, May 31, 2014, and May 31, 2015. 
       The
Top and Drop Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides $250 million of reinsurance limits which may be used for Coverage A, Coverage B, or a combination
of both. For June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, Coverage A reinsures the "Top" of the program and provides 12.66% of $500 million excess of a $3.25 billion retention. For
June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, Coverage B allows the program limit to "Drop" and provides reinsurance for 25% of $250 million in limits excess of a $750 million
retention and after the Company has incurred $500 million in losses "otherwise recoverable" under the agreement. Losses from multiple qualifying occurrences, in excess of $750 million
per occurrence, can apply to this $500 million threshold. 
       The
New Jersey and Florida components of the reinsurance program are designed separately from the other components of the program to address the distinct needs of our separately
capitalized legal entities in those states. The New Jersey agreement reinsures personal lines property losses resulting from multiple perils and consists of three contracts which expire on
May 31, 2013, May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2015. The Florida component will be placed in May of 
67

Allstate Protection's separate reinsurance programs in Pennsylvania and Kentucky will continue to address exposures unique to those states. A description of the catastrophe reinsurance treaties
that will reinsure Allstate Protection as of June 1, 2012 follows: 
       Nationwide
excluding Florida and New Jersey


The Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement reinsures personal lines property and auto excess catastrophe
losses caused by multiple perils under Seven Layers of coverage as follows: 













 
 First Layer
 
 $250 million limit in excess of a $500 million retention and after an initial $250 million in losses "otherwise recoverable"
has been satisfied, 1 reinstatement


 
 Second Layer
 
 $250 million limit in excess of a $750 million retention, 1 reinstatement


 
 Third Layer
 
 $500 million limit in excess of a $1 billion retention, 1 reinstatement


 
 Fourth Layer
 
 $750 million limit in excess of a $1.5 billion retention, 1 reinstatement


 
 Fifth Layer
 
 $1 billion limit in excess of a $2.25 billion retention, 1 reinstatement


 
 Sixth Layer
 
 $500 million limit in excess of a $3.25 billion retention






Coverage
for the First through the Fifth Layers comprises three contracts, each contract providing one third of 95% of the total limit and expiring as of May 31, 2013, May 31, 2014 and
May 31, 2015. Coverage for the Sixth Layer will comprise five contracts and will be 82.34% placed. For June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, two existing contracts, expiring
May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2014, provide 31.67% of the placed limit; and three newly placed contracts, expiring May 31, 2013, May 31, 2014, and May 31, 2015, in total
provide 50.67% of the placed limit. The newly placed contracts, effective June 1, 2012, will not have a prepaid reinstatement limit thus requiring premium for the reinstatement of limits. The
Sixth Layer does not have a reinstatement of limits. Reinsurance premium is subject to redetermination for exposure changes at each anniversary. 


The Top and Drop Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement reinsures personal lines property and auto excess catastrophe
losses caused by multiple perils under a three year term contract expiring May 31, 2014. The reinsurance limit may be used for Coverage A, Coverage B or a combination of both and
is not subject to reinstatement. For June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, Coverage A of the Top and Drop provides 12.66% of $500 million in limits in excess of a
$3.25 billion retention, which completes the 95% placement of the Sixth Layer of the Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement. Coverage B provides 25% of
$250 million in limits in excess of a $750 million retention. In addition to this retention, the Company must incur $500 million in losses, "otherwise recoverable", under
Coverage B during the contract year before Coverage B attaches. Losses from multiple qualifying occurrences can apply to this $500 million threshold. For June 1, 2013 to
May 31, 2014, the contract provides 6% of Coverage A's and 12.66% of Coverage B's placement. Reinsurance premium is subject to redetermination for exposure changes. 

       New
Jersey


The Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance contract reinsures personal lines property excess catastrophe losses in New Jersey
caused by multiple perils. One existing and a newly placed contract each provides 32% of $400 million of limits excess of a $150 million retention and include one reinstatement per
contract year. In addition, a separate existing New Jersey contract will remain in place until May 31, 2013 and provides a First Layer of 32% of $300 million of limits in excess of a
$184 million retention and a Second Layer of 42% of $200 million in limits excess of a $484 million retention. Each Layer includes one reinstatement per contract year. The
reinsurance premium and retention are subject to redetermination for exposure changes at each anniversary. 

       Pennsylvania


The Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract reinsures personal lines property losses in Pennsylvania caused by multiple
perils. This agreement will be effective June 1, 2012 for three years and provide 95% of $100 million of limits in excess of a $100 million retention with two limits being
available for the remaining term of the contract. The reinsurance premium and retention are not subject to redetermination for exposure changes.

       Kentucky


The Earthquake Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract reinsures personal lines property losses in Kentucky caused by
earthquakes or fires following earthquakes. The agreement is effective June 1, 2012 for three years and provides 95% of $25 million of limits in excess of a $5 million retention.
The agreement provides three limits over its three year term subject to two limits being available in any one contract year. The reinsurance premium and retention are not subject to redetermination
for exposure changes. 

       See
Note 10 for further details of the existing 2011 program. 
       We
estimate that the total annualized cost of all catastrophe reinsurance programs for the year beginning June 1, 2012 will be approximately $577 million compared to
$564 million annualized cost for the year beginning June 1, 2011. The total cost of our catastrophe reinsurance programs in 2011 was $558 million compared to $593 million
in 2010. These annual costs reflect premium re-measurements recognized in the year. We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory
authorities.

  ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT     
       Overview and strategy    The Allstate Financial segment is a major provider of life insurance, retirement and
investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance. We serve our customers through Allstate exclusive agencies, workplace distribution and non-proprietary distribution
channels. Allstate Financial's strategic vision is to reinvent protection and retirement for the consumer and its purpose is to create financial value and to add strategic value to the organization. 
       To
fulfill its purpose, Allstate Financial's primary objectives are to deepen relationships with Allstate customers by adding financial services to their suite of products with Allstate,
dramatically expand Allstate Benefits (our workplace distribution business) and improve profitability by decreasing earnings volatility and increasing our returns. Allstate Financial brings value to
The Allstate Corporation in three principal ways: through profitable growth of Allstate Financial, improving the economics of the Protection business through increased customer loyalty and renewal
rates by cross selling Allstate Financial products to existing customers, and by bringing new customers to Allstate. We continue to shift our mix of products in force by decreasing spread based
products, principally fixed annuities and institutional products, and through growth of underwritten products having mortality or morbidity risk, principally life insurance and accident and health
products. In addition to focusing on higher return markets, products, and distribution channels, Allstate Financial continues to emphasize capital efficiency and enterprise risk and return management
strategies and actions. 
       Allstate
Financial's strategy provides a platform to profitably grow its business. Based upon Allstate's strong financial position and brand, we have a unique opportunity to
cross-sell to our customers. We will leverage trusted customer relationships through our Allstate exclusive agencies or direct marketing to serve those who are looking for assistance in
meeting their protection and retirement needs by providing them with the information, products and services that they need. Life insurance applications issued through Allstate agencies increased 33%
in 2011 compared to 2010. Our employer relationships through Allstate Benefits also afford opportunities to offer additional Allstate products. 
       Our
products include interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities; voluntary accident and health insurance; and
funding agreements backing medium-term notes, which we most recently offered in 2008. Our products are sold through multiple distribution channels including Allstate exclusive agencies and
exclusive financial specialists, independent agents (including master brokerage agencies and workplace enrolling agents), specialized structured settlement brokers and directly through call centers
and the internet.

Table of Contents
Our
institutional product line consists of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. Banking
products and services were previously offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. In 2011, after receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased operations. In the
first half of 2012, we expect to cancel the bank's charter and deregister The Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding company. 
 Allstate Financial outlook  

We plan to continue to increase premiums and contract charges on underwritten insurance products and develop products our
customers need for retirement income. Our growth initiatives will be primarily focused on increasing the number of customers served through our proprietary and
Allstate Benefits (workplace distribution) channels. We will continue to focus on improving returns and reducing our concentration in spread based products resulting in net
reductions in contractholder funds obligations. We expect increases in Allstate Financial's attributed GAAP equity as there may be limitations on the amount of dividends
Allstate Financial companies can pay without prior approval by their insurance departments. We expect lower investment spread due to reduced contractholder funds, the continuing low
interest rate environment and
changes in asset allocations. The amount by which the low interest rate environment will reduce our investment spread is contingent on our ability to maintain the portfolio yield and lower interest
crediting rates on spread based products, which could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees, and may not match the timing or magnitude of
changes in asset yields. We also anticipate changing our asset allocation for long-term immediate annuities by reducing fixed income securities and increasing investments in limited
partnerships, equities and other alternative investments. This shift could result in lower and more volatile investment income; however, we anticipate that this strategy will lead to higher total
returns and attributed equity.

       Net income in 2011 was $586 million compared to $58 million in 2010. The
$528 million increase was primarily due to net realized capital gains in the current year compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year, decreased

Table of Contents
interest
credited to contractholder funds, higher life and annuity premiums and contract charges and lower life and annuity contract benefits, partially offset by higher amortization of DAC and lower
net investment income. 
       Net
income in 2010 was $58 million compared to a net loss of $483 million in 2009. The favorable change of $541 million was primarily due to lower amortization of
DAC, decreased interest credited to contractholder funds and higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment income, higher life and annuity contract benefits and
increased net realized capital losses. 
        Analysis of revenues    Total revenues increased 18.6% or $838 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to net realized capital gains in the
current
year compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year and higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment income. Total revenues decreased 1.9% or
$87 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower net investment income and higher net realized capital losses, partially offset by higher premiums and contract charges. 
       Life and annuity premiums and contract charges    Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance, immediate annuities with
life
contingencies, and accident and health insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive and variable life insurance
and fixed annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate account liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance,
administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates.

(1)Contract
charges related to the cost of insurance totaled $659 million, $637 million and $616 million in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. 

       Total premiums and contract charges increased 3.2% in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher contract charges on interest-sensitive life
insurance products primarily resulting from the aging of our policyholders, growth in Allstate Benefits's accident and health insurance business in force and increased traditional life insurance
premiums. Increased traditional life insurance premiums were primarily due to lower reinsurance premiums resulting from higher retention, partially offset by lower renewal premiums. 
       Total
premiums and contract charges increased 10.7% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales of accident and health insurance through Allstate Benefits, with a significant
portion of the increase resulting from sales to employees of one large company, and higher contract charges on interest-sensitive life insurance products resulting from a shift in the mix of policies
in force to contracts with higher cost of insurance rates and policy administration fees. In addition, increased traditional life insurance premiums in 2010 were primarily due to lower reinsurance
premiums resulting from higher retention, partially offset by lower renewal premiums and decreased sales. 
       Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products, such as
interest-sensitive life insurance, fixed annuities, funding agreements and bank deposits. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the
contractholder less

(1)The
table above illustrates the changes in contractholder funds, which are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. The table above is intended to supplement our discussion and analysis of revenues, which are presented net of reinsurance on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As a result, the net change in contractholder funds associated with products reinsured to third parties is reflected as a component of the other adjustments line. 

       Contractholder funds decreased 12.2%, 8.3% and 10.0% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting our continuing actions to reduce our
concentration in spread-based products and the return of funds to Allstate Bank account holders in December 2011 in connection with ceasing operations. Average contractholder funds decreased 10.2% in
2011 compared to 2010 and 9.2% in 2010 compared to 2009. 
       Contractholder
deposits decreased 32.6% in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower deposits on Allstate Bank products and fixed annuities. In September 2011, Allstate Bank stopped
opening new customer accounts. 
       Contractholder
deposits decreased 24.9% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower deposits on fixed annuities. Deposits on fixed annuities decreased 52.5% in 2010 compared to 2009
due to our strategic decision to discontinue distributing fixed annuities through banks and broker-dealers and our goal to reduce our concentration in spread-based products and improve returns on new
business. 
       Maturities
and retirements of institutional products decreased $966 million to $867 million in 2011 from $1.83 billion in 2010, reflecting the continuing decline in
these obligations over the past four years. 
       Maturities
and retirements of institutional products decreased 61.6% to $1.83 billion in 2010 from $4.77 billion in 2009. During 2009, we retired all of our remaining
outstanding extendible institutional market obligations totaling $1.45 billion. In addition, 2009 included the redemption of $1.39 billion of institutional product liabilities in
conjunction with cash tender offers. 
       Surrenders
and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities, interest-sensitive life insurance products and Allstate Bank products (including maturities of certificates of deposit)
increased 23.0% to $6.40 billion in 2011 from $5.20 billion in 2010, and increased 0.6% in 2010 from $5.17 billion in 2009. In 2011, the increase was primarily due to higher
surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities and the return of $1.09 billion of funds to Allstate Bank account holders, partially offset by lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on
interest-sensitive life insurance products. The increase for fixed annuities resulted from an increased number of contracts reaching the 30-45 day period (typically at their 5 or
6 year anniversary) during which there is no surrender charge as well as crediting rate actions taken by management. In 2010, the increase was primarily due to higher surrenders and partial
withdrawals on fixed annuities, partially offset by lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on Allstate Bank products.

contractholder funds, was 15.9% in 2011 compared to 12.2% in 2010 and 11.8% in 2009. Excluding Allstate Bank products, the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and
interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds, was 12.6% in 2011 compared to 10.1% in 2010 and 9.6% in 2009. 
       Net investment income decreased 4.8% or $137 million to $2.72 billion in 2011 from $2.85 billion in 2010 primarily
due to lower average investment balances which were partially offset by higher yields. The higher yields are primarily attributable to yield optimization actions including the termination of interest
rate swaps during the first quarter of 2011. Net investment income decreased 6.9% or $211 million to $2.85 billion in 2010 from $3.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower
yields, reduced average investment balances and risk reduction actions. 
       Net realized capital gains and losses are presented in the following table for the years ended December 31.

        Analysis of costs and expenses    Total costs and expenses increased 0.2% or $11 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher
amortization of DAC, partially offset by lower interest credited to contractholder funds and life and annuity contract benefits. Total costs and expenses decreased 13.9% or $719 million in 2010
compared to 2009 primarily due to lower amortization of DAC and interest credited to contractholder funds, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits. 
       Life and annuity contract benefits decreased 3.0% or $54 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to reserve reestimations
recorded in second quarter 2010 that did not recur in 2011 and a $38 million reduction in accident and health insurance reserves at Allstate Benefits as of December 31, 2011 related to a
contract modification, partially offset by unfavorable mortality experience on life insurance. 
       The
reserve reestimations in the second quarter of 2010 utilized more refined policy level information and assumptions. The increase in reserves for certain secondary guarantees on
universal life insurance policies resulted in a charge to contract benefits of $68 million and a related reduction in amortization of DAC of $50 million. The decrease in reserves for
immediate annuities resulted in a credit to contract benefits of $26 million. The net impact was an increase to income of $8 million, pre-tax. 
       Life
and annuity contract benefits increased 12.2% or $198 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher contract benefits on accident and health insurance and
interest-sensitive life insurance products, partially offset by lower contract benefits on immediate annuities with life contingencies. Higher contract benefits on accident and health insurance were
proportionate to growth in premiums. The increase in contract benefits on interest-sensitive life insurance was primarily due to the reestimation of reserves for certain secondary guarantees on
universal life insurance policies and higher mortality experience resulting from an increase in average claim size and higher incidence of claims. Lower contract benefits on immediate annuities with
life contingencies were due to the reestimation of reserves for benefits payable to certain annuitants to reflect current contractholder information. 
       We
analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits
excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies ("benefit spread"). This implied interest totaled $541 million in 2011, $549 million
in 2010 and $558 million in 2009.

       Benefit spread increased 23.6% or $120 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to reestimations of reserves that increased contract
benefits for interest-sensitive life insurance and decreased contract benefits for immediate annuities with life contingencies in 2010, a reduction in accident and health insurance reserves at
Allstate Benefits as of December 31, 2011 related to a contract modification, and favorable morbidity experience on certain accident and health products and growth at Allstate Benefits. 
       Benefit
spread decreased 3.2% or $17 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to higher mortality experience on interest-sensitive life insurance and
reestimations of reserves that increased contract benefits for interest-sensitive life insurance and decreased contract benefits for immediate annuities, partially offset by growth in accident and
health insurance sold through Allstate Benefits. 
       Interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 9.0% or $162 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower average
contractholder funds and lower interest crediting rates on deferred fixed annuities, interest-sensitive life insurance and immediate fixed annuities. Additionally, valuation changes on derivatives
embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged increased interest credited to contractholder funds by $18 million in 2011. Amortization of deferred sales inducement costs was
$23 million in 2011 compared to $27 million in 2010. 
       Interest
credited to contractholder funds decreased 15.0% or $319 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower average contractholder funds and management actions to
reduce interest crediting rates on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance. In addition, the decline in 2010 also reflects lower amortization of DSI. Amortization of DSI
declined to $27 million in 2010 compared to $129 million in 2009, primarily due to a $46 million decrease in amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses and a
$38 million reduction in amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions. 
       In
order to analyze the impact of net investment income and interest credited to contractholders on net income, we monitor the difference between net investment income and the sum of
interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies, which is included as a component of life and annuity contract benefits on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations ("investment spread").

       Investment spread increased 6.6% or $33 million in 2011 compared to 2010 as actions to improve investment portfolio yields and lower
crediting rates more than offset the effect of the continuing decline in our spread-based business in force. 
       Investment
spread increased 30.8% or $117 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as lower net investment income was more than offset by decreased interest credited to contractholder
funds, which includes lower amortization of DSI. Excluding amortization of DSI, investment spread increased 2.9% or $15 million in 2010 compared to 2009.

(1)The
impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of DAC is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to
the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets. Fluctuations result from changes in the impact of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits. 

       The increase of $237 million in 2011 was primarily due to increased amortization relating to realized capital gains, lower amortization in
the second quarter of 2010 resulting from decreased benefit spread on interest-sensitive life insurance due to the reestimation of reserves, and an unfavorable change in amortization
acceleration/deceleration for changes in assumptions. In 2011, DAC amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses primarily resulted from realized capital gains on sales of fixed income
securities. 
       The
decrease of $609 million in 2010 was primarily due to a favorable change in amortization acceleration/deceleration for changes in assumptions, lower amortization relating to
realized capital gains and losses, a decreased amortization rate on fixed annuities and lower amortization from decreased benefit spread on interest-sensitive life insurance due to the reestimation of
reserves. In 2010, DAC amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses primarily resulted from realized capital gains on derivatives and sales of fixed income securities. 
       During
the first quarter of 2011, we completed our annual comprehensive review of the profitability of our products to determine DAC balances for our interest-sensitive life, fixed
annuities and other investment contracts which covers assumptions for investment returns, including capital gains and losses, interest crediting rates to policyholders, the effect of any hedges,
persistency, mortality and expenses in all product lines. The review resulted in an acceleration of DAC amortization (charge to income) of $12 million in the first quarter of 2011. Amortization
acceleration of $17 million related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to an increase in projected expenses. Amortization deceleration of $5 million related to
equity-indexed annuities and was primarily due to an increase in projected investment margins. 
       In
2010, our annual comprehensive review resulted in a deceleration of DAC amortization (credit to income) of $12 million. Amortization deceleration of $45 million related
to variable life insurance and was primarily due to appreciation in the underlying separate account valuations. Amortization acceleration of $32 million related to interest-sensitive life
insurance and was primarily due to an increase in projected realized capital losses and lower projected renewal premium (which is also expected to reduce persistency), partially offset by lower
expenses. 
       In
2009, our annual comprehensive review resulted in the acceleration of DAC amortization of $277 million. $289 million related to fixed annuities, of which
$210 million was attributable to market value adjusted annuities, and $18 million related to variable life insurance. Partially offsetting these amounts was amortization deceleration for
interest-sensitive life insurance of $30 million. The principal assumption impacting fixed annuity amortization acceleration was an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in
2009 and 2010. For interest-sensitive life insurance, the amortization deceleration was due to a favorable change in our mortality assumptions, partially offset by increased expected capital losses.

(1)Included
as a component of amortization of DAC on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  (2)Represents
the change in the DAC adjustment for unrealized capital gains and losses. The DAC adjustment balance was $(126) million and
$75 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains and losses in
the respective product portfolios were realized. 

       On January 1, 2012, we will adopt new DAC accounting guidance on a retrospective basis (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial
statements for further details). It is currently estimated that the restated Allstate Financial DAC balance will decline by $508 million when compared to the reported December 31, 2011
balance. We estimate that the new DAC accounting guidance will reduce net income by approximately $40 million, after-tax, in 2012. 
       Operating costs and expenses decreased 3.0% or $14 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased 9.1% or $39 million in
2010 compared to 2009. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses for the years ended December 31.

       Non-deferrable
acquisition costs in 2011 were comparable to 2010. Other operating costs and expenses decreased 4.7% or $14 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily
due to lower employee and professional service costs, reduced insurance department assessments for 2011 and lower net Allstate agencies distribution channel expenses reflecting increased fees from
sales of third party financial products, partially offset by a charge related to the liquidation plan for Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. 
       Non-deferrable
acquisition costs increased 7.7% or $12 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher non-deferrable commissions related to
accident and health insurance business sold through Allstate Benefits. Other operating costs and expenses increased 9.9% or $27 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher product
development, marketing and technology costs, increased litigation expenses, lower reinsurance expense allowances resulting from higher retention and increases in the net cost of employee benefits. In
2010, these increased costs were partially offset by our expense reduction actions, which resulted in lower employee, professional services and sales support expenses. 
       During
2009, restructuring and related charges of $25 million were recorded in connection with our plan to improve efficiency and narrow our focus of product offerings. In
accordance with this plan, among other actions, we eliminated approximately 1,000 workforce positions relative to December 31, 2008 levels through a combination of attrition, position
elimination and outsourcing. This reduction reflected approximately 30% of Allstate Financial's work force at the time the plan was initiated. 
77



 
       Loss on disposition of $15 million in 2011 includes $22 million related to the dissolution of Allstate Bank. In 2011, after
receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased operations. In the first half of 2012, we expect to cancel the bank's charter and deregister The Allstate Corporation as a
savings and loan holding company. 
       Income tax expense was $286 million in 2011 compared to income tax expense of $8 million in 2010 and an income tax benefit
of $82 million in 2009. The change in 2011 was due to the proportionate change in income on which income tax expense was determined. The income tax benefit for 2009 included expense of
$142 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of 2009. This valuation allowance was
released in connection with the adoption of new OTTI accounting guidance on April 1, 2009; however, the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse the
amount recorded in income tax benefit. 
        Reinsurance ceded    We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers to limit our risk of mortality and morbidity losses. In
addition,
Allstate Financial has used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, 42% and 45%, respectively, of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. Additionally, we ceded substantially all of the risk associated with our
variable annuity business and we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on substantially all of our long-term care contracts.

(1)The
Company has extensive reinsurance contracts directly with Swiss Re and its affiliates and indirectly through Swiss Re's acquisition of
other companies with whom we had reinsurance or retrocession contracts.  (2)The
reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid benefits related to the Scottish Re Group as of December 31, 2011 comprised
$73 million related to Scottish Re Life Corporation and $61 million related to Scottish Re (U.S.), Inc. The reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid benefits related to the
Scottish Re Group as of December 31, 2010 comprised $73 million related to Scottish Re Life Corporation and $63 million related to Scottish Re (U.S.), Inc. (3)As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the other category includes $103 million and $106 million, respectively, of
recoverables due from reinsurers with an investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor's ("S&P").  (4)N/A
reflects no rating available. 

       Certain of our reinsurers experienced rating downgrades in 2011 by S&P, including Surety Life of Denver and Mutual of Omaha. We continuously
monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed.
No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three-years ended December 31, 2011. 
       We
enter into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal
entities. These reinsurance agreements 
78



 
have
been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  INVESTMENTS     
        Overview and strategy    The return on our investment portfolios is an important component of our financial results. Investment portfolios are
segmented
between the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. While taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate, we manage the underlying portfolios based
upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. 
       We
employ a strategic asset allocation approach which considers the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes
in which we invest. This asset allocation is informed by our global economic and market outlook, as well as other inputs and constraints, including diversification effects, duration, liquidity and
capital considerations. Within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. We manage risks associated
with interest rates, credit spreads, equity markets, real estate and currency exchange rates. Our continuing focus is to manage risks and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market
opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. 
       The
Property-Liability portfolio's investment strategy emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has
produced competitive returns over the long term, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. 
       The
Allstate Financial portfolio's investment strategy focuses on the total return of assets needed to support the underlying liabilities, asset-liability management and achieving an
appropriate return on capital. 
       The
Corporate and Other portfolio's investment strategy balances the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio in relation to the overall corporate capital structure with the pursuit of
returns. 
 Investments outlook  
       We anticipate the financial markets will continue to have periods of high volatility. Invested assets and income are expected to
decline in line with reductions in contractholder funds for the Allstate Financial segment. We plan to focus on the following priorities:


Optimizing return and risk in an uncertain economic climate and volatile investment markets. Expanding ownership of real estate and
other cash-generating assets, including real assets, through direct and
fund investments. Managing the alignment of assets with respect to Allstate Financial's changing liability profile.

(1)Fixed
income securities are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these securities was $27.12 billion, $44.30 billion
and $1.96 billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively.  (2)Equity
securities are carried at fair value. Cost basis for these securities was $4.04 billion and $159 million for
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial, respectively.  (3)We
have commitments to invest in additional limited partnership interests totaling $1.22 billion and $797 million for
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial, respectively.  (4)Short-term
investments are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these investments was $451 million,
$645 million and $195 million for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively.  (5)Balances
reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments. 

       Total investments decreased to $95.62 billion as of December 31, 2011, from $100.48 billion as of December 31, 2010,
primarily due to net reductions in contractholder funds, partially offset by higher valuations of fixed income securities. Valuations of fixed income securities are typically driven by a combination
of changes in relevant risk-free interest rates and credit spreads over the period. Risk-free interest rates are typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities,
whereas credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk-free rate that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or
prepayment risks. U.S. Treasury securities continue to trade in active markets, and the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities remains an appropriate basis for determining risk-free
rates. The increase in valuation of fixed income securities during 2011 was due to declining risk-free interest rates, partially offset by widening credit spreads. 
       The
Property-Liability investment portfolio increased to $36.00 billion as of December 31, 2011, from $35.05 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to
the acquisition of Esurance, higher valuations of fixed income securities, positive operating cash flows and increased collateral from securities lending activities, partially offset by dividends paid
by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to its parent, The Allstate Corporation (the "Corporation"). 
       The
Allstate Financial investment portfolio decreased to $57.37 billion as of December 31, 2011, from $61.58 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to
net reductions in contractholder funds of $5.86 billion, partially offset by higher valuations of fixed income securities. 
       The
Corporate and Other investment portfolio decreased to $2.25 billion as of December 31, 2011, from $3.85 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to
the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial, share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders and interest paid on debt, partially offset by dividends of $838 million paid by AIC to the
Corporation.

       As
of December 31, 2011, 92.1% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or
Baa from Moody's, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch, Dominion, or Realpoint, a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from A.M. Best, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided
rating is not available. All of our fixed income securities are rated by third party credit rating agencies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), and/or internally rated. Our
initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a thorough due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the
credit quality, sector, structure, and liquidity risks of each issue.

(1)The
nature of the activities supporting revenue bonds is highly diversified and includes transportation, health care, industrial development,
housing, higher education, utilities, recreation/convention centers and other activities. 

       Our practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor. We
currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments. As a result of downgrades in the insurers' credit ratings, the ratings of the
insured municipal bonds generally reflect the underlying ratings of the primary obligor. As of December 31, 2011, 99.3% of our insured municipal bond portfolio is rated investment grade. 
       ARS
totaled $742 million with an unrealized net capital loss of $80 million as of December 31, 2011. Our holdings primarily have a credit rating of Aaa. As of
December 31, 2011, $710 million of our ARS backed by student loans was 80% to 100% insured by the U.S. Department of Education. All of our ARS holdings are experiencing failed auctions
and we receive the failed auction rate or, for those which contain maximum reset rate formulas, we receive the contractual maximum rate. We anticipate that failed auctions may persist and most of our
holdings will continue to pay the failed auction rate or, for those that contain maximum rate reset formulas, the maximum rate. Auctions continue to be conducted as scheduled for each of the
securities. 
       Corporate bonds, including publicly traded and privately placed, totaled $43.58 billion as of December 31, 2011 with an
unrealized net capital gain of $2.36 billion. Privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are directly negotiated with the borrower or are in
unregistered form. 
       Our
portfolio of privately placed securities is broadly diversified by issuer, industry sector and country. The portfolio is made up of 525 issuers. Privately placed corporate
obligations contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or
fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities. Additionally, investments in these securities are made after extensive due diligence of the issuer,
typically including direct discussions with senior management and on-site visits to company facilities. Ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the
issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position. Every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least
once a year. 
       Foreign government securities totaled $2.08 billion as of December 31, 2011, with 100% rated investment grade and an
unrealized net capital gain of $215 million. Of these securities, 18.8% are backed by the U.S. government, 35.1% are in Canadian governmental securities held in our Canadian subsidiary and the
remaining 46.1% are highly diversified in other foreign governments.

Table of Contents
       RMBS, CMBS and ABS are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by residential and commercial real estate loans and other
consumer or corporate borrowings. The cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so that
each security issued by the trust, typically referred to as a "class", qualifies for a specific original rating. For example, the "senior" portion or "top" of the capital structure, or rating class,
which would originally qualify for a rating of Aaa typically has priority in receiving principal repayments on the underlying collateral and retains this priority until the class is paid in full. In a
sequential structure, underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated Aaa class in the structure until paid in full, after which principal repayments are directed to
the next most senior Aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full. Senior Aaa classes generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro-rata basis after losses are
absorbed by classes with lower original ratings. The payment priority and class subordination included in these securities serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the
structures. These securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the securitization trust. Other forms of credit enhancement may include structural
features embedded in the securitization trust, such as overcollateralization, excess spread and bond insurance. The underlying collateral can have fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such
as adjustable rate mortgages) or may contain features of both fixed and variable rate mortgages. 
       RMBS, including U.S. Agency, Prime, Alt-A and Subprime, totaled $4.12 billion, with 63.7% rated investment grade, as of
December 31, 2011. The RMBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk, but unlike other fixed income securities, is additionally subject to significant prepayment risk from the underlying
residential mortgage loans. The credit risk associated with U.S. Agency portfolio is mitigated because they were issued by or have underlying collateral guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The
unrealized net capital loss of $411 million as of December 31, 2011 was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase on the non-U.S. Agency portion of our RMBS
portfolio, largely due to higher risk premiums caused by macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration, including the impact of lower residential real estate valuations, which show signs of
stabilization or recovery in certain geographic areas but remain under stress in other geographic areas. The following table shows our RMBS portfolio as of December 31, 2011 based upon vintage
year of the issuance of the securities.

       Prime are collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to prime borrowers. As of December 31, 2011, $684 million of the Prime
had fixed rate underlying collateral and $228 million had variable rate underlying collateral. 
       Alt-A
includes securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers who do not qualify for prime financing terms due to high
loan-to-value ratios or limited supporting documentation, but have stronger credit profiles than subprime borrowers. As of December 31, 2011, $386 million of the
Alt-A had fixed rate underlying collateral and $113 million had variable rate underlying collateral. 
       Subprime
includes securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers that cannot qualify for Prime or Alt-A financing terms due in part to weak or
limited credit history. It also includes securities that are collateralized by certain second lien mortgages regardless of the borrower's credit history. The Subprime portfolio consisted of
$605 million and $208 million of first lien and second lien securities, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, $444 million of the Subprime had fixed rate underlying
collateral and $369 million had variable rate underlying collateral. 
       CMBS totaled $1.78 billion, with 90.5% rated investment grade, as of December 31, 2011. The CMBS portfolio is subject to
credit risk, but unlike certain other structured securities, is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgage loans. Of the CMBS investments,
93.0% are traditional
conduit transactions collateralized by commercial mortgage loans, broadly diversified across property types and geographical

       The unrealized net capital loss of $178 million as of December 31, 2011 on our CMBS portfolio was the result of wider credit spreads
than at initial purchase, largely due to the macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration, including the impact of lower commercial real estate valuations, which show signs of
stabilization or recovery in certain geographic areas but remain under stress in other geographic areas. CMBS credit spreads are wider than at initial purchase in our 2005-2007 vintage
year CMBS. 
       ABS, including CDO and Consumer and other ABS, totaled $3.97 billion, with 93.7% rated investment grade, as of December 31,
2011. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral. Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as
overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and/or insurance. The unrealized net capital loss of $214 million as of December 31, 2011 on our ABS portfolio
was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase. 
       CDO
totaled $1.62 billion, with 85.6% rated investment grade, as of December 31, 2011. CDO consist primarily of obligations collateralized by high yield and investment
grade corporate credits including $1.34 billion of cash flow collateralized loan obligations ("CLO") with unrealized losses of $136 million. Cash flow CLO are structures collateralized
primarily by below investment grade senior secured corporate loans. The underlying collateral is actively managed by external managers that monitor the collateral's performance and is well diversified
across industries and among issuers. The remaining $283 million of securities consisted of synthetic CDO, trust preferred CDO, project finance CDO, market value CDO, collateralized bond
obligations and other CLO with unrealized losses of $117 million. 
       Consumer
and other ABS totaled $2.34 billion, with 99.3% rated investment grade, as of December 31, 2011. Consumer and other ABS consists of $684 million of consumer
auto and $1.66 billion of credit card and other ABS with unrealized gains of $1 million and $38 million, respectively. 
        Equity securities    Equity securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks
and real estate investment trust equity investments. The equity securities portfolio was $4.36 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $4.81 billion as of December 31,
2010. Net unrealized gains totaled $160 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $583 million as of December 31, 2010. 
       Mortgage loans    Our mortgage loan portfolio, which is primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio, totaled $7.14 billion as of
December 31, 2011, compared to $6.68 billion as of December 31, 2010, and primarily comprises loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Key
considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification. 
       We
recognized $37 million of realized capital losses related to net increases in the valuation allowance on impaired mortgage loans in 2011, primarily due to the risk associated
with refinancing near-term maturities, and decreases in occupancy which resulted in deteriorating debt service coverage and declines in property valuations. While property valuations show
signs of stabilization or recovery in many larger, primary markets, valuations in many smaller cities remain under stress. We recognized $65 million of realized capital losses related to net
increases in the valuation allowance on impaired loans in 2010. 
       For
further detail on our mortgage loan portfolio, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements. 
       Limited partnership interests consist of investments in private equity/debt funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and tax credit funds.
The limited partnership interests portfolio is well diversified across a number of characteristics

(1)Impairment
write-downs related to Cost limited partnerships were $4 million and $45 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Impairment write-downs related to EMA limited partnerships were $2 million and $1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

       Limited partnership interests, excluding impairment write-downs, produced income of $247 million in 2011 compared to income of
$129 million in 2010. Income on EMA limited partnerships is recognized on a delay due to the availability of the related financial statements. The recognition of income on hedge funds is
primarily on a one-month delay and the income recognition on private equity/debt funds, real estate funds and tax credit funds are generally on a three-month delay. Income on Cost limited
partnerships is recognized only upon receipt of amounts distributed by the partnerships. 
       Short-term investments    Our short-term investment portfolio was $1.29 billion and $3.28 billion as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
        Other investments    Our other investments as of December 31, 2011 primarily comprise $1.15 billion of policy loans, $339 million
of bank loans and $168 million of certain derivatives. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans and are carried at
amortized cost. For further detail on our use of derivatives, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. 
       Unrealized net capital gains totaled $2.88 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to unrealized net capital gains of
$1.39 billion as of December 31, 2010. The improvement since December 31, 2010 for fixed income securities was due to declining risk-free interest rates, partially
offset by widening credit spreads. The decline since December 31, 2010 for

(1)Included
in par value are zero-coupon securities that are generally purchased at a deep discount to the par value that is received
at maturity. These primarily included corporate, U.S. government and agencies, municipal and foreign government zero-coupon securities with par value of $514 million,
$948 million, $3.48 billion and $382 million, respectively.  (2)Excluding
the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of amortized cost to par value would be 100.5% for corporates,
101.4% for U.S. government and agencies, 101.2% for municipals and 103.3% for foreign governments. Similarly, excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of fair value
to par value would be 106.2% for corporates, 104.7% for U.S. government and agencies, 106.1% for municipals and 111.3% for foreign governments. 

       The banking, financial services, and capital goods sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income
securities portfolio as of December 31, 2011. In general, credit spreads remain wider than at initial purchase for most of the securities with gross unrealized losses in these categories. 
       The
unrealized net capital gain for the equity portfolio totaled $160 million and comprised $369 million of gross unrealized gains and $209 million of gross
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2011. This is compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the equity portfolio totaling $583 million, comprised of $646 million of gross
unrealized gains and $63 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010.

       Within the equity portfolio, the losses were primarily concentrated in financial services, emerging market equity funds and index-based funds. The
unrealized losses were company and sector specific. As of December 31, 2011, we have the intent and ability to hold our equity securities with unrealized losses until recovery. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of our investments in the European Union ("EU") is $4.03 billion, with net unrealized capital gains of $79 million,
comprised of $224 million of gross unrealized gains and $145 million of gross unrealized losses. The following table summarizes our total direct exposure related to Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Portugal and Spain (collectively "GIIPS") and the EU.

       We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security that may be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized
cost (for fixed income securities) or cost (for equity securities) is below established thresholds. The process also includes the monitoring of other impairment indicators such as ratings, ratings
downgrades and payment defaults.
The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch-list. All investments
in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2011 were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value were other than temporary. 
       The
extent and duration of a decline in fair value for fixed income securities have become less indicative of actual credit deterioration with respect to an issue or issuer. While we
continue to use declines in fair value and the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position as indicators of potential credit deterioration, our determination of

whether
a security's decline in fair value is other than temporary has placed greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit and collateral and related estimates of future cash flows.

       We have experienced declines in the fair values of fixed income securities primarily due to wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk
premiums since the time of initial purchase, largely due to macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration, including the impact of lower real estate valuations, which show signs of
stabilization or recovery in certain geographic areas but remain under stress in other geographic areas. Consistent with their ratings, our portfolio monitoring process indicates that investment grade
securities have a low risk of default. Securities rated below investment grade, comprising securities with a rating of Ba, B and Caa or lower, have a higher risk of default. As of December 31,
2011, 40% of our below investment grade gross unrealized losses related to Subprime RMBS. 
       Fair
values for our structured securities are obtained from third-party valuation service providers and are subject to review as disclosed in our Application of Critical Accounting
Estimates. In accordance with GAAP, when fair value is less than the amortized cost of a security and we have not made the decision to sell the security and it is not more likely than not we will be
required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate if we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We
calculate the estimated recovery value by discounting our best estimate of future cash flows at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, and compare this to the amortized
cost of the security. If we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the credit
loss component of the impairment is recorded in earnings, with the remaining amount of the unrealized loss related to other factors ("non-credit-related") recognized in other comprehensive
income. 
       The
non-credit-related unrealized losses for our structured securities, including our below investment grade Subprime, are heavily influenced by risk factors other than those
related to our best estimate of future cash flows. The difference between these securities' original or current effective rates and the yields implied by their fair value indicates that a higher risk
premium is included in the valuation of these securities than existed at initial issue or purchase. This risk premium represents the return that a market participant requires as compensation to assume
the risk associated with the uncertainties regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. The risk premium is comprised of: default risk, which reflects the probability of default and
the uncertainty related to collection of contractual principal and interest; liquidity risk, which reflects the risk associated with exiting the investment in an illiquid market, both in terms of
timeliness and cost; and volatility risk, which reflects the potential valuation volatility during an investor's holding period. Other factors reflected in the risk premium include the costs
associated with underwriting, monitoring and holding these types of complex securities. Certain aspects of the default risk are included in the development of our best estimate of future cash flows,
as appropriate. Other aspects of the risk premium are considered to be temporary in nature and are expected to reverse over the remaining lives of the securities as future cash flows are received. 
 Other-than-temporary impairment assessment for below investment grade Subprime RMBS  
       As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses totaled
$586 million, a decrease of 26.4% compared to $796 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to sales. As of December 31, 2011, gross unrealized losses for our below
investment grade Subprime portfolio totaled $334 million, an improvement of 23.7% compared to $438 million as of December 31, 2010, due to impairment write-downs, sales and
principal collections, partially offset by the downgrade of certain securities to below investment grade 
90



 
Table of Contents
and
lower valuations. For our below investment grade Subprime with gross unrealized gains totaling $5 million, we have recognized cumulative write-downs in earnings totaling $123 million
as of December 31, 2011. 
       The
credit loss evaluation for Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses is performed in two phases. The first phase estimates the future cash flows of the entire securitization
trust from which our security was issued. A critical part of this estimate involves forecasting default rates and loss severities of the residential mortgage loans that collateralize the
securitization trust. The factors that affect the default rates and loss severities include, but are not limited to, historical collateral performance, collateral type, transaction vintage year,
geographic concentrations, borrower credit quality, origination practices of the transaction sponsor, and practices of the mortgage loan servicers. Current loan-to-value ratios
of underlying collateral are not consistently available and accordingly they are not a primary factor in our impairment evaluation. While our projections are developed internally and customized to our
specific holdings, they are informed by and benchmarked against credit opinions obtained from third parties, such as industry analysts, nationally recognized
credit rating agencies and an RMBS loss modeling advisory service. The default rate and loss severity forecasts result in an estimate of trust-level projected additional collateral loss. 
       We
then analyze the actual cumulative collateral losses incurred to date by the securitization trust, our projected additional collateral losses expected to be incurred and the position
of the class of securities we own in the securitization trust relative to the trust's other classes to determine whether any of the collateral losses will be applied to our class. If our class has
remaining credit enhancement sufficient to withstand the projected additional collateral losses, no collateral losses will be realized by our class and we expect to collect all contractual principal
and interest of the security we own. Remaining credit enhancement is measured in terms of (i) subordination from other classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to
absorb losses before the class of security we own and (ii) the expected impact of other structural features embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to our class, such as
overcollateralization and excess spread. 
       For
securities where there is insufficient remaining credit enhancement for the class of securities we own, a recovery value is calculated based on our best estimate of future cash flows
specific to that security. This estimate is based on the contractual principal payments and current interest payments of the securities we own, adjusted for actual cumulative collateral losses
incurred to date and the projected additional collateral losses expected to be incurred. This estimate also takes into consideration additional secondary sources of credit support, such as reliable
bond insurance. For securities without secondary sources of credit support or for which the secondary sources do not fully offset the actual and projected additional collateral losses applied to them,
a credit loss is recorded in earnings to the extent amortized cost exceeds recovery value. 
       75.3%,
20.9% and 3.8% of the fair value of our below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses were issued with Aaa, Aa and A original ratings and capital
structure classifications, respectively. As described previously, Subprime securities with higher original ratings typically have priority in receiving the principal repayments on the underlying
collateral compared to those with lower original ratings. While the projected cash flow assumptions for our below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses have deteriorated
since the securities were originated, as reflected by their current credit ratings, these securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the
securitization trust.

(1)Weighted
average actual cumulative collateral losses incurred to date as of period end are based on the actual principal losses incurred as a
percentage of the remaining principal amount of the loans in the trust. The weighting calculation is based on the par value of each security. Actual losses on the securities we hold are less than the
losses on the underlying collateral as presented in this table. Actual cumulative realized principal losses on the below investment grade Subprime securities we own, as reported by the trust
servicers, were $16 million as of December 31, 2011.  (2)Weighted
average projected additional collateral losses to be incurred as of period end are based on our projections of future losses to be
incurred by the trust, taking into consideration the actual cumulative collateral losses incurred to date, as a percentage of the remaining principal amount of the loans in the trust. Our projections
are developed internally and customized to our specific holdings and are informed by and benchmarked

against
credit opinions obtained from third parties, such as industry analysts, nationally recognized credit rating agencies and an RMBS loss modeling advisory service. Projected additional collateral
losses to be incurred are compared to average remaining credit enhancement for each security. For securities where the projected additional collateral losses exceed remaining credit enhancement, a
recovery value is calculated to determine whether impairment losses should be recorded in earnings. The weighting calculation is based on the par value of each security.  

(3)Weighted
average remaining credit enhancement as of period end is based on structural subordination and the expected impact of other
structural features existing in the securitization trust beneficial to our class and reflects our projection of future principal losses that can occur as a percentage of the remaining principal amount
of the loans in the trust before the class of the security we own will incur its first dollar of principal loss. The weighting calculation is based on the par value of each security. (4)As
of December 31, 2011, $122 million of unrealized losses on securities with other-than-temporary
impairments recognized in earnings and $104 million of unrealized losses on securities without other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings have been greater
than or equal to 20% of those securities' amortized cost for a period of more than 24 consecutive months. As of December 31, 2010, $188 million of unrealized losses on securities with
other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings and $108 million of unrealized losses on securities without other-than-temporary
impairments recognized in earnings have been greater than or equal to 20% of those securities' amortized cost for a period of more than 24 consecutive months. 

       The above tables include information only about below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses that are not reliably
insured as of each period presented. As such, the par value and composition of securities included can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in variables such as credit ratings,
principal payments, sales, purchases and realized principal losses. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, our Subprime securities that are reliably insured include nine below investment grade Subprime securities with a total fair value of $87 million
and aggregate gross unrealized losses of $36 million, all of which are rated B. These securities are insured by one bond insurer rated B that we estimate has sufficient claims paying capacity
to service its obligations on these securities. The securitization trusts from which our securities were issued are currently receiving contractual payments from the bond insurer and considering the
combination of expected future payments from the bond insurer and cash flows available from the underlying collateral, we expect the trust to have adequate cash flows to make all contractual payments
due to the class of securities we own. As a result, our security-specific estimates of future cash flows indicate that these securities' estimated recovery values equal or exceed their amortized cost.
Accordingly, no other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities. As of
December 31, 2010, our Subprime securities that are reliably insured included ten below investment grade Subprime securities with a total fair value of $76 million and aggregate gross
unrealized losses of $68 million. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, our below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses that are not reliably insured and without
other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings had incurred actual cumulative collateral losses of 8.8%. Our impairment evaluation forecasts more severe assumptions than
the trusts are actually experiencing, including a projected weighted average underlying default rate of 51.9% and a projected weighted average loss severity of 69.5%, which resulted in projected
additional collateral losses of 35.7%. As the average remaining credit enhancement for these securities of 46.0% exceeds the projected additional collateral losses of 35.7%, these securities have not
been impaired. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, our below investment grade Subprime securities with gross unrealized losses that are not reliably insured and with
other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings had incurred actual cumulative collateral losses of 18.8%. Our impairment evaluation forecasts more severe assumptions
than the trusts are actually experiencing, including a projected weighted average underlying default rate of 56.8% and a projected weighted average loss severity of 76.5%, which resulted in projected
additional collateral losses of 42.8%. As the average remaining credit enhancement for these securities of 20.2% is insufficient to withstand the projected additional collateral losses, we have
recognized cumulative write-downs in earnings on the securities as reflected in the table above using our calculated recovery value at the time of impairment. The current average recovery value of
these securities as a percentage of par was 67.1% and exceeded these securities' current average amortized cost as a percentage of par of 65.4%, which demonstrates our conclusion that the nature of
the remaining unrealized loss on these securities is temporary and will reverse over time. The comparison indicates that recovery value exceeds amortized cost based on a comprehensive evaluation of
financial, economic and capital markets assumptions developed for this reporting period. 
       We
believe the unrealized losses on our Subprime securities, including those over 24 months, result from the current risk premium on these securities, which should continue to
reverse over the securities' remaining lives, as demonstrated by improved valuations since 2009, primarily in 2010. We expect to receive our estimated share of contractual principal and interest
collections used to determine the securities' recovery value. As of December 31, 2011, we do not have the intent to sell and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell these
securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. We believe that our valuation and impairment processes are comprehensive, employ the most current views about collateral and
securitization trust financial positions, and demonstrate our recorded impairments and that the remaining unrealized losses on these positions are temporary.

       Net investment income decreased 3.2% or $131 million in 2011 compared to 2010, after decreasing 7.7% or $342 million in 2010
compared to 2009. The 2011 decline was primarily due to lower average investment balances due to decreased Allstate Financial contractholder funds, partially offset by higher yields. The higher yields
are primarily attributable to yield optimization actions including the termination of interest rate swaps during the first quarter of 2011, higher distributions from cost method limited partnerships
and dividend income from equity securities. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, risk reduction actions related to municipal bonds and commercial real estate, duration
shortening actions taken to protect the portfolio from rising interest rates and lower average investment balances.

       Impairment write-downs in 2011 were primarily driven by RMBS, which experienced deterioration in expected cash flows; investments with commercial
real estate exposure, including CMBS, mortgage loans and municipal bonds, which were impacted by lower real estate valuations or experienced deterioration in expected cash flows; and corporate fixed
income securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances. Impairment write-downs on below investment grade RMBS and CMBS in 2011 were $169 million and $55 million, respectively.
Equity securities were also written down due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our assessment of the financial condition and near-term and
long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends.

       The change in intent write-downs in 2011 were primarily a result of ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios resulting in write-downs of
individually identified investments, primarily lower yielding, floating rate RMBS and municipal bonds, and equity securities. The change in intent write-downs in 2010 were primarily a result of
ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios resulting in write-downs of individually identified investments, primarily municipal bonds and RMBS. 
       Sales generated $1.34 billion of net realized gains in 2011 primarily due to $1.11 billion of net gains on sales of
corporate, foreign government, U.S. government, ABS, U.S. Agency and municipal fixed income securities and $202 million of net gains on sales of equity securities. During the second half of
2011, interest rates were at historical lows and we capitalized on valuation gains on fixed income securities through $8.49 billion in sales generating $750 million of realized capital
gains. Net realized gains from sales of $686 million in 2010 were primarily due to $595 million of net gains on sales of corporate, U.S. government, foreign government and municipal
fixed income securities and $210 million of net gains on sales of equity securities, partially offset by $139 million of net losses on sales of CMBS and ABS. 
       Valuation and settlements of derivative instruments net realized capital losses totaling $396 million in 2011 included
$291 million of losses on the valuation of derivative instruments and $105 million of losses on the settlement of derivative instruments. The net realized capital losses on derivative
instruments in 2011 primarily included losses on interest rate risk management due to decreases in interest rates. In 2010, net realized capital losses on the valuation and settlement of derivative
instruments totaled $601 million. As a component of our approach to managing interest rate risk, realized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in
conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. This approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to our overall financial condition. 
 
 
  MARKET RISK     
       Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency
exchange rates. Adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy, the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress
of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and/or risk tolerance. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and
equity prices. 
       The
active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges:
1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market
risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 7 of the
consolidated financial statements. 
       Overview    In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive
rates
and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the
underlying risks and product profiles of each business. 
       Investment
policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that
conduct investment activities follow 
95



 
Table of Contents
policies
that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus,
product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries' boards of directors and investment committees.
For Allstate Financial, its asset-liability management
("ALM") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks. ALM focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve
profitability and returns for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset-liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies
specify limits, ranges and/or targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financial's business objectives in light of its product liabilities. 
       We
manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration, simulation, and as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that
place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as
portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day-to-day
management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the ALM organization. This integration is intended to result in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and
return, conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of Allstate Financial's product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics. 
       Although
we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. 
       Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate
characteristics of our interest bearing assets and liabilities. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issue
interest-sensitive liabilities. Interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key risk-free reference yields. 
       We
manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures
the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected
to decrease in value by 5%. To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk-free
market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and
determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments,
all other financial instruments, and certain other items including unearned premiums, property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, annuity liabilities and other interest-sensitive
liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage
and/or option features of instruments, where applicable. The preceding assumptions relate primarily to mortgage-backed securities, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate
obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property-liability policies. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the difference between our asset and liability duration was a (0.62) gap, compared to a (0.65) gap as of December 31, 2010. A negative duration gap
indicates that the fair value of our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our assets. The Property-Liability segment generally maintains a positive duration
gap between its assets and liabilities due to the relatively short duration of auto and homeowners claims, which are its primary liabilities. The Allstate Financial segment may have a positive or
negative duration gap, as the duration of its assets and liabilities vary with its product mix and investing activity.
As of December 31, 2011, Property-Liability had a positive duration gap while Allstate Financial had a negative duration gap. 
       In
the management of investments supporting the Property-Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return
framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. 
       For
the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that
will earn stable spreads across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. To achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of
managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels. 
96



 
Table of Contents
This
philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments in addition to interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps, floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk
resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of
investments and product sales to customers. 
       Based
upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation, and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate,
parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by $127 million, compared to a decrease of $36 million as of
December 31, 2010, reflecting year to year changes in duration. Reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses swaps, eurodollar futures, options on Treasury
futures and interest rate swaptions to manage interest rate risk. In calculating the impact of a 100 basis point increase on the value of the derivatives, we have assumed interest rate volatility
remains constant. Based on the swaps, eurodollar futures, options on Treasury futures and interest rate swaptions in place as of December 31, 2011, we would recognize realized capital losses
totaling $14 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $15 million in realized capital gains in the event of a 100 basis point immediate,
parallel interest rate decrease on these derivatives. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events,
but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. There are $10.49 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest-sensitive life that
are not financial instruments. These assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate. The $10.49 billion of assets excluded from the calculation has increased
from $9.60 billion as of December 31, 2010, due to an increase in interest-sensitive life contractholder funds and improved fixed income valuations as a result of declining
risk-free interest rates and tightening of credit spreads in certain sectors. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates,
the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $660 million, compared to a decrease of $549 million as of December 31, 2010. 
       To
the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations
assume that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest
rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes
in interest rates. 
       We
pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivative transactions, master netting agreements are
used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements and, when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2011, we held
$64 million of cash and securities pledged by counterparties as collateral for OTC instruments, and we pledged $82 million of cash and securities as collateral to counterparties. We
performed a sensitivity analysis on OTC derivative collateral by assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point decline in interest rates. The analysis indicated that we would have to post an estimated
$2 million in additional collateral. The selection of these hypothetical scenarios should not be construed as our prediction of future events, but only as an illustration of the estimated
potential effect of such events. We also actively manage our counterparty credit risk exposure by monitoring the level of collateral posted by our counterparties with respect to our receivable
positions. 
       Credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads ("spreads"). This risk arises from many
of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets. 
       We
manage the spread risk in our assets. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration. Spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in
spreads. For example, if spreads increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%. 
       Spread
duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration. As of December 31, 2011, the spread duration of Property-Liability assets was 4.77, compared to 4.45 as of
December 31, 2010, and the spread duration of Allstate Financial assets was 5.58, compared to 4.97 as of December 31, 2010. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this
spread duration calculation, and spreads in effect as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes, industry sectors
and credit ratings ("spread shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets by $4.10 billion, compared to $3.61 billion as of December 31, 2010. Reflected in the duration
calculation are the effects of our risk mitigation actions that use CDS to manage spread risk. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed as our
prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.

       Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. As of
December 31, 2011, we held $4.26 billion in common stocks and exchange traded and mutual funds and $4.82 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily limited
partnership interests, non-redeemable preferred securities and equity-linked notes), compared to $4.67 billion and $4.88 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
2010. 95.7% and 63.3% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of the Property-Liability operations as of December 31, 2011, compared to 95.5% and 63.1%, respectively, as of
December 31, 2010. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of 0.72, compared to a beta of 0.74 as of
December 31, 2010. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investment's market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the S&P 500. Based on
the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases or decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by 7.2%, respectively. Based upon the
information and assumptions we used to calculate beta as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our
equity investments identified above by $652 million, compared to $695 million as of December 31, 2010, and an immediate increase in the S&P 500 of 10% would increase the
net fair value by $654 million compared to $708 million as of December 31, 2010. In calculating the impact of a 10% S&P index perturbation on the value of the puts, we have
assumed index volatility remains constant. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease or increase in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an
illustration of the potential effect of such an event. 
       The
beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by calculating the change in the fair value of the portfolio resulting from stressing the equity market
up and down 10%. The illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio (hence its beta) and correlation relationships differ from the
historical relationships. 
       As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $6.98 billion and
$8.68 billion, respectively. Equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and/or income benefits provided by our variable products. In
2006, we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary of Prudential
Financial Inc. and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk. Equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits. Total variable life contract
charges for 2011 and 2010 were $76 million and $80 million, respectively. Separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were $716 million and $775 million
in December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
       As
of December 31, 2011 and 2010 we had $3.86 billion and $4.70 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest
crediting rates based on the performance of the S&P 500. We hedge the majority of the risk associated with these liabilities using equity-indexed options and futures, interest rate swaps, and
eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value-at-risk limits. 
       Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including real estate funds and private equity funds, and our Canadian and Northern Ireland operations. We also have certain
fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies; however, derivatives are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of approximately 38% of the fixed income securities. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, we had $1.24 billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments, $786 million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, and
$363 million in unhedged non-dollar pay fixed income securities. These amounts were $1.70 billion, $773 million, and $91 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2010. 90.0% of the foreign currency exposure is in the Property-Liability business. 
       Based
upon the information and assumptions used as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to
which we are exposed would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by $225 million, compared with an estimated $257 million
decrease as of December 31, 2010. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an
illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 33 currencies as of December 31, 2011, compared to 32 currencies as of December 31,
2010. Our largest individual foreign currency exposures as of December 31, 2011 were to the Canadian dollar (39.6%) and the Japanese Yen (10.4%). The largest individual foreign currency
exposures as of December 31, 
98



 
Table of Contents
2010
were to the Canadian dollar (37.0%) and the British Pound (13.3%). Our primary regional exposure is to Canada, with 39.6% as of December 31, 2011, compared to Canada, with 37.0% as of
December 31, 2010. 
       The
modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely
that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse
market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. 
 
 
  PENSION PLANS     
       We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full-time and certain part-time employees and
employee-agents. See Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. The pension and other
postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time. Any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans. 
       We
report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders' equity. It represents differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost. The measurement of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon
the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. The unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost as of
December 31, 2011 was $1.43 billion, an increase of $239 million from $1.19 billion as of December 31, 2010. The increase was the result of a lower discount rate
used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations along with asset returns that were less than expected. 
       The
market-related value component of expected returns recognizes plan losses and gains on equity securities over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the
long-term nature of
pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value of equity securities on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations
actually occur. 
       Net
periodic pension cost in 2012 is estimated to be $270 million based on current assumptions, including settlement charges. This represents a decrease compared to
$304 million in 2011 due to an increase in the market-related value of assets and a decrease in anticipated settlement charges. Net periodic pension cost decreased in 2011 compared to
$345 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in the market-related value of assets. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2010 due to the effect of equity losses during the 2008 fiscal
year and the decrease in discount rates experienced at the end of 2009. In 2011 and 2010, net pension cost included non-cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum
distributions made to agents. Settlement charges also occurred during 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan as a result of lump sum payments made from the plan.
Settlement charges are likely to continue for some period in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. 
       Amounts
recorded for pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity and credit markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial
gains and losses, resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $153 million in 2011 and $160 million in 2010. We anticipate that the
unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of assets in 2012 and into the foreseeable future, resulting in
additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. 
       Amounts
recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted
average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past
employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a
theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-callable bonds and bonds with a make-whole provision available in the Barclays corporate bond universe having ratings of at
least "AA" by S&P or at least "Aa" by Moody's on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by
changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and
accumulated other comprehensive income.

Table of Contents 
       Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of
$52 million in net periodic pension cost and a $427 million increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2011, compared to an increase of $43 million in net periodic pension cost and a $392 million increase in the unrecognized
pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability as of December 31, 2010. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic
pension cost by $46 million and would decrease the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income
by $360 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $38 million and a $331 million decrease in the unrecognized pension and
other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2010. This non-symmetrical range results from
the non-linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. 
       The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions
and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets
may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses and recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in results of operations in periods subsequent to those in which the
fluctuations actually occur. 
       Holding
other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of
$47 million in pension cost as of December 31, 2011, compared to $44 million as of December 31, 2010. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $47 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $44 million as of
December 31, 2010. 
       We
target funding levels that do not restrict the payment of plan benefits in our domestic plans and were within our targeted range as of December 31, 2011. In 2011, we
contributed $264 million to our pension plans. We expect to contribute $417 million for the 2012 fiscal year to maintain the plans' funded status. This estimate could change
significantly following either a dramatic improvement or decline in investment markets. 
 Other post employment benefits  
       In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law. One aspect of this legislation is the introduction of an
excise tax, effective in 2018, on "high cost" plans. The liabilities as of December 31, 2011 for the postretirement medical plans include an estimate of this additional liability, which amounts
to $3 million. 
 
 
  GOODWILL     
       Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
balances were $824 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2011 and $456 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2010 for the Allstate Protection
segment and the Allstate Financial segment, respectively. The increase in 2011 relates to the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial. Our reporting units are equivalent to our reporting
segments, Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. 
       Goodwill
is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of
the close of the third quarter. We also review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely
than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value. 
       Impairment
testing requires the use of estimates and judgments. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
the second step of the goodwill test is required. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a
business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income. 
       To
estimate the fair value of our reporting units for our annual impairment test as of September 30, 2011, we utilized a combination of widely accepted valuation techniques
including a stock price and market capitalization analysis, 
100



 
Table of Contents
discounted
cash flow calculations and peer company price to earnings multiples analysis. The analyses were weighted based on management's judgment of their relevance given current facts and
circumstances. 
       The
stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from
historical insurance industry acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The discounted
cash flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth, capital growth, earnings projections including those used in our strategic plan, and an appropriate discount rate. The peer
company price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price earnings multiples of peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from our strategic plan. We apply
significant judgment when determining the fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The
valuation analyses described above are subject to critical judgments and assumptions and may be potentially sensitive to variability. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent
management's reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions utilized may differ from future actual results. Declines in the estimated fair
value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which may be material to our results of operations but not our financial position. 
       Goodwill
impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of December 31, 2011 and no reporting unit was at risk of having its carrying value including goodwill exceed its fair
value. 
 
 
  DEFERRED TAXES     
       As of December 31, 2011, we had a net deferred tax asset of $520 million. Included in the deferred tax asset was
$99 million, net of valuation allowance, for net operating loss carryforwards obtained in the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial. The total deferred tax valuation allowance was
$67 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $6 million as of December 31, 2010. The valuation allowance increased primarily
due to the acquisition of Answer Financial. The valuation allowance relates to the portion of Answer Financial's net operating loss carryforwards that, due to limitations contained in the Internal
Revenue Code, are expected to expire prior to their utilization. 
       We
evaluate whether a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is required each reporting period. A valuation allowance is established if, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, all available evidence is
considered. This includes the potential for capital and ordinary loss carryback, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies that we may employ to avoid a tax
benefit from expiring unused and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences. 
       With
respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset on capital losses that have been realized but have not yet been recognized for tax
purposes, we utilize prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that optimize the ability to carry back capital losses as well as the ability to offset future capital losses with unrealized capital
gains that could be recognized for tax purposes. We have remaining capital loss carryback capacity of $266 million, $37 million and $329 million from 2009, 2010 and 2011,
respectively. 
       With
respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset on unrealized capital losses on fixed income and equity securities, our tax
planning strategies first consider the availability of unrealized capital gains to offset future capital losses and then we rely on our assertion that we have the intent and ability to hold certain
securities with unrealized losses to recovery. As a result, the unrealized losses on these securities would not be expected to materialize and no valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax
asset is needed.

       Shareholders' equity decreased in 2011, primarily due to share repurchases and dividends paid to
shareholders, partially offset by net income and increased unrealized net capital gains on investments. Shareholders' equity increased in 2010, primarily due to unrealized net capital gains on
investments and net income, partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. 
       Debt    The debt balance did not change during 2011 and decreased $2 million in 2010. On January 11, 2012, we issued $500 million
of 5.20% Senior Notes due 2042, utilizing the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2009. The proceeds of this issuance will be used for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of $350 million of 6.125% Senior Notes maturing on February 15, 2012. The next debt maturity is on June 15, 2013 when
$250 million of 7.50% Debentures are due. For further information on outstanding debt, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
       Share repurchases    In September 2011, we completed our $1.00 billion share repurchase program that we commenced in November 2010. In
November
2011, we commenced a $1.00 billion share repurchase program that is expected to be completed by March 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, this program had $894 million
remaining. 
       Since
1995, we have acquired 496 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $20.20 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued
99 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation and the 2001 redemption of certain
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Since 1995, total shares outstanding has decreased by 395 million shares or 44.1%, primarily due to our repurchase programs. 
       On
November 8, 2011, we announced that we may issue debt or preferred stock to fund the existing $1.00 billion share repurchase program.

       Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability
management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. 
       On
November 8, 2011, Moody's affirmed The Allstate Corporation's debt and commercial paper ratings of A3 and P-2, respectively, AIC's financial strength rating of Aa3
and Allstate Life Insurance Company's ("ALIC's") financial strength rating of A1. The outlook for all Moody's ratings was revised to negative from stable. On November 2, 2011, S&P affirmed The
Allstate Corporation's debt and commercial paper ratings of A- and A-2, respectively, AIC's financial

strength
rating of AA- and ALIC's financial strength rating of A+. The outlook for all S&P ratings was revised to negative from stable. On January 26, 2012, A.M. Best
affirmed The Allstate Corporation's debt and commercial paper ratings of a- and AMB-1, respectively, and our insurance entities financial strength ratings of A+ for AIC and
ALIC. The outlook for AIC is stable and ALIC was revised to stable
from negative. A.M. Best also gives our legal entities that are fully reinsured the financial strength rating of the assuming company. 
       We
have distinct and separately capitalized groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida that maintain separate group ratings. The
ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group. Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure
financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company, which writes auto and homeowners insurance, is rated A- by A.M. Best. The outlook
for this rating is stable. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company also has a Financial Stability Rating® of A" from Demotech, which was affirmed on November 16, 2011. Castle Key
Insurance Company, which underwrites personal lines property insurance in Florida, is rated B- by A.M. Best. The outlook for the rating is negative. Castle Key Insurance Company
also has a Financial Stability Rating® of A' from Demotech, which was affirmed on November 16, 2011. 
       ALIC,
AIC and The Allstate Corporation are party to the Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement ("Liquidity Agreement") which allows for short-term advances of
funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. ALIC and AIC
each serve as a lender and borrower and the Corporation serves only as a lender. AIC also has a capital support agreement with ALIC. Under the capital support agreement, AIC is committed to provide
capital to ALIC to maintain an adequate capital level. The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion. 
       In
addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which include, but are not limited to, AIC and ALIC. The
amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation's subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation. The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible
subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to $1.00 billion. The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany
borrowings. 
       Allstate's
domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted
by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium
growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings. As of December 31, 2011, AIC's statutory surplus is approximately $15.13 billion compared to
$15.38 billion as of December 31, 2010. These amounts include ALIC's statutory surplus of approximately $3.46 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared to
$3.34 billion as of December 31, 2010. 
       The
ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property-casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a
company's premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies, and for homeowners and related coverages
that have significant net exposure to natural catastrophes a ratio of 1 to 1 is considered appropriate. AIC's premium to surplus ratio was 1.6x as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
       State
laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurer's solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard
formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property-liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for
reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance
companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. As of December 31, 2011, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was within the
range that we target. 
       The
NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial
condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance
companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of
the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges.

       We actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions. Liquidity is
managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the Company, and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs.
Additionally, we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility. 
       Parent company capital capacity    At the parent holding company level, we have deployable invested assets totaling $2.24 billion as of
December 31, 2011. These assets include investments that are generally saleable within one quarter totaling $1.72 billion. The substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries
is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation. In 2012, AIC will have the capacity to pay dividends currently estimated at $1.51 billion without prior regulatory approval. In
addition, we have access to $1.00 billion of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an unsecured revolving credit facility. This provides funds for the parent company's relatively low
fixed charges and other corporate purposes. 
       In
2011, dividends totaling $838 million were paid by AIC to its parent, the Corporation. In 2010, dividends totaling $1.30 billion were paid by AIC to the Corporation.
There were no dividends paid by AIC to the Corporation in 2009. There were no capital contributions paid by the Corporation to AIC in 2011, 2010 or 2009. 
       In
2011, 2010 and 2009, return of capital by American Heritage Life Investment Corporation to the Corporation totaled $27 million, $24 million and $13 million,
respectively. 
       In
2011, return of capital by Kennett Capital Holdings, LLC to the Corporation totaled $5 million.

Table of Contents
       There
were no capital contributions by AIC to ALIC in 2011 or 2010. In 2009, capital contributions of $697 million were paid by AIC to ALIC. 
       The
Corporation has access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows:

A commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs. As
of December 31, 2011, there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was $1.00 billion; however, the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily. Our primary credit facility is available for short-term liquidity requirements and backs our commercial paper
facility. Our $1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial term of five years expiring in May 2012. The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest
commitment being $185 million. We have the option to extend the expiration by one year upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two-thirds of the
commitments to lend. The commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender's commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. This facility
contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new
lenders. This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreement. This ratio as of December 31, 2011 was 20.0%.
Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior,
unsecured, nonguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2011. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the
commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. A universal shelf registration statement was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2009. We
can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 399 million shares of treasury stock as of December 31, 2011), preferred stock,
depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will
be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements. 
        Liquidity exposure    Contractholder funds as of December 31, 2011 were $42.33 billion. The following table summarizes contractholder
funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions as of December 31, 2011.

$8.76 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5% of the account balance. (2)$5.28 billion
of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30-45 day period at the
end of their initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods (which are typically 5 or 6 years) during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment. (3)70%
of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of 3% or higher.  (4)Includes
$1.16 billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to The Prudential Insurance Company of
America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc., in 2006. 

       While we are able to quantify remaining scheduled maturities for our institutional products, anticipating retail product surrenders is less
precise. Retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons. Reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in
life insurance coverage needs. Other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge, the length of time the contract has been in
force, distribution channel, market interest rates, equity market conditions and potential tax implications. In addition, the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is
for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement. Surrenders and partial withdrawals for our retail annuities increased 21.9% in 2011
compared to 2010. The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds, was
12.6% and 10.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Allstate

strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders; however, statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests. 
       Our
institutional products are primarily funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts used to back medium-term notes. As of December 31, 2011, total institutional
products outstanding were $1.88 billion, with scheduled maturities of $40 million, $1.75 billion and $85 million in 2012, 2013 and 2016, respectively. 
       Our
asset-liability management practices limit the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance,
annuity and institutional product obligations. 
       Certain
remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade
in our long-term debt rating of A3, A- and a- (from Moody's, S&P and A.M. Best, respectively) to non-investment grade status of below
Baa3/BBB-/bb, a downgrade in AIC's financial
strength rating from Aa3, AA- and A+ (from Moody's, S&P and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa2/BBB/A-, or a downgrade in ALIC's financial strength ratings from A1,
A+ and A+ (from Moody's, S&P and A.M. Best, respectively) to below A3/A-/A-. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities;
therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.

unit cash flows reflect the elimination of intersegment dividends, contributions and borrowings. 

       Property-Liability    Lower cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher claim payments, partially
offset
by lower income tax payments. Lower cash provided by operating activities for Property-Liability in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to income tax payments in 2010 compared to income tax
refunds in 2009 and lower claim payments. 
       Cash
provided by investing activities in 2011 compared to cash used in investing activities in 2010 was primarily due to higher net sales of fixed income and equity securities, partially
offset by higher net purchases of fixed income and equity securities. Lower cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to decreased net purchases of fixed income and
equity securities and higher net sales of fixed income and equity securities, partially offset by net change in short-term investments. 
        Allstate Financial    Lower cash provided by operating cash flows in 2011 was primarily due to income tax payments in 2011 compared to income
tax
refunds in 2010. Operating cash flows for Allstate Financial in 2010 were higher than 2009 as higher premiums and tax refunds received were partially offset by lower investment income and higher life
and annuity contract benefits paid. 
       Higher
cash provided by investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 were impacted by lower net purchases of fixed income securities and higher net sales of fixed income securities used
to fund reductions in contractholder fund liabilities. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2010 were impacted by reductions of investments to fund reductions in contractholder fund
liabilities. 
       Higher
cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities and Allstate Bank products and lower
deposits on Allstate Bank products and fixed annuities, partially offset by decreased maturities and retirements of institutional products. In 2011, Allstate Bank ceased operations and all funds were
returned to customers by December 31, 2011. Lower cash flows used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 were primarily due to decreased maturities and retirements of institutional
products, partially offset by lower deposits on fixed annuities. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. 
        Corporate and Other    Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany
settlements.
Investing activities primarily relate to investments in the parent company portfolio,

including
the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short-term debt, repayment of
debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the
level of these activities.

(1)Liabilities
for collateral are typically fully secured with cash or short-term investments. We manage our short-term
liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business, including
utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously.  (2)Contractholder
funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life, fixed
annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products. The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life
insurance, immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance. These amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and
policyholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is
essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the
timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed deferred annuities, traditional life insurance, immediate
annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these
contracts, we are not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or (ii) the occurrence of a payment
triggering event such as the surrender or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of our control. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based
on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity,
estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash
outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows
shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of $42.33 billion for contractholder funds and $14.45 billion for reserve for life-contingent contract
benefits as included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2011. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the
discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above.  (3)Our
payment obligations relating to long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase
obligations and pension and other post employment benefits ("OPEB") contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long-term liquidity management program. Amount
differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2011 because the long-term debt amount above includes interest. (4)The
pension plans' obligations in the next 12 months represent our planned contributions, and the remaining years' contributions are
projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans. The OPEB plans' obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid. These
liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $1.89 billion
included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  (5)Reserve
for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims,
including claims that have been IBNR as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns.
However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for IBNR claims. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are
our best estimates. The reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2011, of
$1.61 billion and $225 million, respectively. 

107



 
Table of Contents


(6)Other
liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain
of these long-term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount
of $3.76 billion.  (7)Balance
sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $10.81 billion and deferred tax
liabilities of $2.14 billion netted in the net deferred tax asset of $520 million. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not
contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis. In addition, other
liabilities of $273 million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently
uncertain.  (8)Net
unrecognized tax benefits represent our potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized in
the consolidated financial statements. We believe it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will be reduced by $25 million within the next twelve months upon the resolution of an
outstanding issue resulting from the 2005-2006 Internal Revenue Service examination. The resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what we have accrued.

       Contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership interests and other loans. 
       We
have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material intercompany
transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance

  ENTERPRISE RISK AND RETURN MANAGEMENT     
       Allstate manages enterprise risk under an integrated Enterprise Risk and Return Management ("ERRM") framework with governance and
analytics. This framework provides an enterprise view of risks and opportunities and is used by senior leaders and business managers to drive strategic and business decisions. Allstate's risk
management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments and seek to optimize returns. Allstate continually validates and improves its ERRM practices by benchmarking and securing
external perspectives for our processes. 
       ERRM
governance includes an executive management committee structure, Board oversight and chief risk officers ("CROs"). The Enterprise Risk & Return Council ("ERRC") is Allstate's
senior risk management committee. It directs ERRM by establishing risk-return targets, determining economic capital levels and directing integrated strategies and actions from an
enterprise perspective. It consists of Allstate's chief executive officer, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel and treasurer. Allstate's
Board of Directors and Audit Committee provide ERRM oversight by reviewing enterprise principles, guidelines and limits for Allstate's significant risks and by monitoring strategies and actions
management has taken to control these risks. 
       CROs
are appointed for the enterprise and for Allstate Protection, Allstate Financial and Allstate Investments. Collectively, the CROs create an integrated approach to risk and return
management to ensure risk management practices and strategies are aligned with Allstate's overall enterprise objectives. 
       Our
ERRM governance is supported with an analytic framework to manage risk exposure and optimize returns on risk-adjusted capital. Allstate views economic capital primarily
on a statutory accounting basis. Management and the ERRC use enterprise stochastic modeling, risk expertise and judgment to determine an appropriate level of enterprise economic capital to hold
considering a broad range of risk objectives. These include limiting risks of financial stress, insolvency, likelihood of capital stress and volatility, maintaining stakeholder value and financial
strength ratings and satisfying regulatory risk-based capital requirements. Enterprise economic capital approximates a combination of statutory surplus and deployable invested assets at
the parent holding company level.

Table of Contents 
 
       Using our governance and analytic framework, Allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize returns on risk-adjusted
capital. Examples include shifting Allstate Financial away from spread-based products toward underwritten products, implementing a suite of margin improvement and exposure reduction actions in
homeowners insurance and shifting our fixed income securities portfolio from short and long maturities towards intermediate maturities to optimize returns, reductions in certain asset classes such as
municipal securities or European sovereign debt and manage risk under a steep and potentially changing interest rate curve. 
 
  REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     
       We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on
specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
  PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS     
       There are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the
implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of these pending standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. 
       The
effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the
standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the
relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.  
    Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
       Information required for Item 7A is incorporated by reference to the material under the caption "Market Risk" in Part II,
Item 7 of this report.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
1.     General  
 Basis of presentation  
       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Allstate Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
primarily Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"), a property-liability insurance company with various property-liability and life and investment subsidiaries, including Allstate Life Insurance Company
("ALIC") (collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Allstate"). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
       To
conform to the current year presentation, certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified. 
       The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Nature of operations  
       Allstate is engaged, principally in the United States, in the property-liability insurance, life insurance, retirement and investment
product business. Allstate's primary business is the sale of private passenger auto and homeowners insurance. The Company also sells several other personal property and casualty insurance products,
select commercial property and casualty coverages, life insurance, annuities, voluntary accident and health insurance and funding agreements. Allstate primarily distributes its products through
exclusive agencies, financial specialists, independent agencies, call centers and the internet. 
       The
Allstate Protection segment principally sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, with earned premiums accounting for 79% of Allstate's 2011 consolidated revenues.
Allstate was the country's second largest insurer for both private passenger auto and homeowners insurance as of December 31, 2010. Allstate Protection, through several companies, is authorized
to sell certain property-liability products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The Company is also authorized to sell certain insurance products in Canada. For 2011, the top
geographic locations for premiums earned by the Allstate Protection segment were New York, California, Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of premiums
earned for Allstate Protection. 
       Allstate
has exposure to catastrophes, an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business, which have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to material
year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position (see Note 8). The nature and level of catastrophic loss caused by natural events
(high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes) and man-made events (terrorism and industrial accidents) experienced
in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to results of operations and financial position. The Company considers the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to
generally be major
metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. The Company considers the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes and fires following
earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The Company also has exposure to
asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims (see Note 14). 
       The
Allstate Financial segment sells life insurance, retirement and investment products and voluntary accident and health insurance. The principal individual products are
interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities including deferred and immediate; and voluntary accident and health insurance. The institutional product line, which the
Company most recently offered in 2008, consists primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional and individual
investors. Banking products and services were previously offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. In 2011, after receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased
operations. In the first half of 2012 the Company expects to cancel the bank's charter and deregister The Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding company. 
       Allstate
Financial, through several companies, is authorized to sell life insurance and retirement products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Guam. For 2011, the top geographic locations for statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment were California, Texas, Florida and Nebraska. No other
jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for 
115



 
Table of Contents
Allstate
Financial. Allstate Financial distributes its products to individuals through multiple distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists,
independent agents (including master brokerage agencies and workplace enrolling agents), specialized structured settlement brokers and directly through call centers and the internet. 
       Allstate
has exposure to market risk as a result of its investment portfolio. Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur realized and unrealized net capital losses due to
adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. The Company's primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity
prices. Interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of its interest bearing assets and
liabilities. This risk arises from many of the Company's primary activities, as it invests substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issues interest-sensitive liabilities. Interest rate risk
includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key risk-free reference yields. Credit spread risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss due to adverse changes
in credit spreads. This risk arises from many of the Company's primary activities, as the Company invests substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets. Equity price risk is the risk that
the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. 
       The
Company monitors economic and regulatory developments that have the potential to impact its business. Federal and state laws and regulations affect the taxation of insurance
companies and life insurance and annuity products. Congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax
treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress
and various state legislatures also consider proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance or annuities. Legislation that increases the
taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of the Company's products making them less competitive.
Such proposals, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position or Allstate Financial's ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing
contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. 
2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Investments  
       Fixed income securities include bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"),
asset-backed securities ("ABS") and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to their contractual maturity, are designated as available for sale and are carried at
fair value. The difference between amortized cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), certain deferred sales inducement
costs ("DSI") and certain reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Cash received from calls, principal
payments and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities and pay-downs, including prepayments, is reflected as a
component of investment collections within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
       Equity
securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments.
Equity securities are designated as available for sale and are carried at fair value. The difference between cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. 
       Mortgage
loans are carried at outstanding principal balances, net of unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are established for impaired loans
when it is probable that contractual principal and interest will not be collected. 
       Investments
in limited partnership interests, including interests in private equity/debt funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and tax credit funds, where the Company's interest is so
minor that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for in accordance with the cost method of accounting; all other investments in limited partnership
interests are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting ("EMA"). 
       Short-term
investments, including money market funds, commercial paper and other short-term investments, are carried at fair value. Other investments primarily
consist of policy
loans, bank loans and derivatives. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances and were $1.15 billion and $1.14 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, 
116



 
Table of Contents
respectively.
Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost. Derivatives are carried at fair value. 
       Investment
income primarily consists of interest, dividends, income from cost method limited partnership interests and income from certain derivative transactions. Interest is recognized
on an accrual basis using the effective yield method and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income for certain RMBS, CMBS and ABS is determined considering estimated
pay-downs, including prepayments, obtained from third party data sources and internal estimates. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are recalculated
when differences arise between the prepayments originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. For beneficial interests in securitized financial assets not of
high credit quality, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis. For other RMBS, CMBS and ABS, the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis. For
other-than-temporarily impaired fixed income securities, the effective yield method utilizes the difference between the amortized cost basis at impairment and the cash flows
expected to be collected. Accrual of income is suspended for other-than-temporarily impaired fixed income securities when the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be
received is not reasonably estimable. Accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans and bank loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not
probable. Cash receipts on investments on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of carrying value. Income from cost method limited partnership interests is recognized upon receipt of
amounts distributed by the partnerships. 
       Realized
capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investment sales, write-downs in value due to other-than-temporary declines in fair value,
adjustments to valuation allowances on mortgage loans, periodic changes in fair value and settlements of certain derivatives including hedge ineffectiveness, and income from EMA limited partnership
interests. Realized capital gains and losses on investment sales, including calls and principal payments, are determined on a specific identification basis. Income from EMA limited partnership
interests is recognized based on the Company's share of the earnings of the partnerships, and is recognized on a delay due to the availability of the related financial statements. Income recognition
on hedge funds is generally on a one month delay and income recognition on private equity/debt funds, real estate funds and tax credit funds is generally on a three month delay. 
       The
Company recognizes other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed income securities in earnings when a security's fair value is less than its amortized cost
and the Company has made the decision to sell or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Additionally, if
the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, the credit loss component of the impairment is recorded in
earnings, with the remaining amount of the unrealized loss related to other factors recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The Company recognizes
other-than-temporary impairment losses on equity securities in earnings when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary including when the Company does not
have the intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover its cost basis. 
 Derivative and embedded derivative financial instruments  
       Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures (interest rate and equity), options
(including swaptions), interest rate caps and floors, warrants and rights, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements, and certain bond
forward purchase commitments. Derivatives required to be separated from the host instrument and accounted for as derivative financial instruments ("subject to bifurcation") are embedded in certain
fixed income securities, equity-indexed life and annuity contracts, reinsured variable annuity contracts and certain funding agreements. 
       All
derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets, other liabilities and accrued expenses or contractholder funds. Embedded
derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. The change in fair value of derivatives embedded in certain
fixed income securities and subject to bifurcation is reported in realized capital gains and losses. The change in fair value of derivatives embedded in life and annuity product contracts and subject
to bifurcation is reported in life and annuity contract benefits or interest credited to contractholder funds. Cash flows from embedded derivatives subject to bifurcation and derivatives receiving
hedge accounting are reported consistently with the host contracts and hedged risks, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from other derivatives are reported in
cash flows from investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
       When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow
hedges. The hedged item may be either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset, liability or an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to a particular risk for 
117



 
Table of Contents
fair
value hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged
item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk. For a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The
Company does not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, the Company confirms that the hedging instrument
continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. Ineffectiveness in fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, if any, is reported in realized capital gains and losses. 
        Fair value hedges    The change in fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of investment assets or a portion thereof is
reported in
net investment income, together with the change in fair value of the hedged items. The change in fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of contractholder funds liabilities or a
portion thereof is reported in interest credited to contractholder funds, together with the change in fair value of the hedged items. Accrued periodic settlements on swaps are reported together with
the changes in fair value of the swaps in net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds. The amortized cost for fixed income securities, the carrying value for mortgage loans or
the carrying value of the hedged liability is adjusted for the change in fair value of the hedged risk. 
        Cash flow hedges    For hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives representing the effective
portion of
the hedge are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified to net investment income, realized capital gains and losses or interest expense as the hedged or forecasted
transaction affects income. Accrued periodic settlements on derivatives used in cash flow hedges are reported in net investment income. The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
for a hedged transaction is limited to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative less the amount reclassified to income, or the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative needed to
offset the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction from inception of the hedge less the derivative gain or loss previously reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to income. If the Company expects at any time that the loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to a net loss on the combination of the hedging
instrument and the hedged transaction which may not be recoverable, a loss is recognized immediately in realized capital gains and losses. If an impairment loss is recognized on an asset or an
additional obligation is incurred on a liability involved in a hedge transaction, any offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified and reported together with the
impairment loss or recognition of the obligation. 
        Termination of hedge accounting    If, subsequent to entering into a hedge transaction, the derivative becomes ineffective (including if the
hedged item
is sold or otherwise extinguished, the occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable or the hedged asset becomes other-than-temporarily impaired), the
Company may terminate the derivative position. The Company may also terminate derivative instruments or redesignate them as non-hedge as a result of other events or circumstances. If the
derivative instrument is not terminated when a fair value hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When
a fair value hedge is no longer effective, is redesignated as non-hedge or when the derivative has been terminated, the fair value gain or loss on the hedged asset, liability or portion
thereof which has already been recognized in income while the hedge was in place and used to adjust the amortized cost for fixed income securities, the carrying value for mortgage loans or the
carrying value of the hedged liability, is amortized over the remaining life of the hedged asset, liability or portion thereof, and reflected in net investment income or interest credited to
contractholder funds beginning in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied. If the hedged item in a fair value hedge is an asset that has become
other-than-temporarily impaired, the adjustment made to the amortized cost for fixed income securities or the carrying value for mortgage loans is subject to the accounting
policies applied to other-than-temporarily impaired assets. 
       When
a derivative instrument used in a cash flow hedge of an existing asset or liability is no longer effective or is terminated, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income as the hedged risk impacts income. If the derivative instrument is not terminated when a cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the
future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a derivative instrument used in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is terminated
because it is probable the forecasted transaction will not occur, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is immediately reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized
capital gains and losses in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied. 
118



 
Table of Contents
       Non-hedge derivative financial instruments    For derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied, the income statement effects,
including fair value gains and losses and accrued periodic settlements, are reported either in realized capital gains and losses or in a single line item together with the results of the associated
asset or liability for which risks are being managed. 
 Securities loaned  
       The Company's business activities include securities lending transactions, which are used primarily to generate net investment income.
The proceeds received in conjunction with securities lending transactions are reinvested in short-term investments and fixed income securities. These transactions are
short-term in nature, usually 30 days or less. 
       The
Company receives cash collateral for securities loaned in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and records
the related obligations to return the collateral in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The carrying value of these obligations approximates fair value because of their relatively
short-term nature. The Company monitors the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary under the terms of the agreements to mitigate
counterparty credit risk. The Company maintains the right and ability to redeem the securities loaned on short notice. 
 Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest credited  
       Property-liability premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies, typically periods
of six or twelve months. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums. Premium installment receivables, net, represent premiums
written and not yet collected, net of an allowance for uncollectible premiums. The Company regularly evaluates premium installment receivables and adjusts its valuation allowance as appropriate. The
valuation allowance for uncollectible premium installment receivables was $70 million and $75 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
       Traditional
life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Voluntary accident
and health insurance products are expected to remain in force for an extended period. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue
when due from policyholders. Benefits are reflected in life and annuity contract benefits and recognized in relation to premiums, so that profits are recognized over the life of the policy. 
       Immediate
annuities with life contingencies, including certain structured settlement annuities, provide insurance protection over a period that extends beyond the period during which
premiums are collected. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when received at the inception of the contract. Benefits and expenses are recognized in relation to premiums. Profits
from these policies come from investment income, which is recognized over the life of the contract. 
       Interest-sensitive
life contracts, such as universal life and single premium life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include
premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and contract charges assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are
reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and
surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. These contract charges are recognized as revenue when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Life and annuity contract
benefits include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance. 
       Contracts
that do not subject the Company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Fixed annuities, including market value
adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities and immediate annuities without life contingencies, and funding agreements (primarily backing medium-term notes) are considered investment
contracts. Consideration received for such contracts is reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account
balance for maintenance, administration and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates, and are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance. 
       Interest
credited to contractholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest-sensitive life contracts and investment contracts. Crediting rates for certain fixed annuities
and interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates. Crediting rates for indexed
annuities and indexed funding agreements are generally based on a specified interest rate index, such as LIBOR, or an equity index, such as the Standard & Poor's ("S&P") 500 Index. Interest
credited also 
119



 
Table of Contents
includes
amortization of DSI expenses. DSI is amortized into interest credited using the same method used to amortize DAC. 
       Contract
charges for variable life and variable annuity products consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balances for contract maintenance, administration, mortality,
expense and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. Contract benefits incurred for variable annuity products include guaranteed minimum death, income, withdrawal and
accumulation benefits. Substantially all of the Company's variable annuity
business is ceded through reinsurance agreements and the contract charges and contract benefits related thereto are reported net of reinsurance ceded. 
 Deferred policy acquisition and sales inducement costs  
       Costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property-liability insurance, life insurance and investment contracts are
deferred and recorded as DAC. These costs are principally agents' and brokers' remuneration, premium taxes, inspection costs, and certain underwriting expenses. DSI costs, which are deferred and
recorded as other assets, relate to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts. These sales inducements are primarily in the form
of additional credits to the customer's account balance or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period which are in excess of the rates currently being credited to similar contracts
without sales inducements. All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and included in operating costs and expenses. DAC associated with property-liability insurance is amortized into income
as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six or twelve months, and is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Future investment income is considered in determining the
recoverability of DAC. Amortization of DAC associated with life insurance and investment contracts is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and is described in more detail
below. DSI is amortized into income using the same methodology and assumptions as DAC and is included in interest credited to contractholder funds. DAC and DSI are periodically reviewed for
recoverability and adjusted if necessary. 
       For
traditional life insurance, DAC is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions used in the
amortization of DAC and reserve calculations are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in
force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events
occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies. 
       For
interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts, DAC and DSI are amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, which
includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization is net of interest on
the prior period DAC balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts. Actual amortization periods generally range from 15-30 years; however, incorporating
estimates of the rate of customer surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the DAC being amortized during the surrender charge period, which is typically
10-20 years for interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for fixed annuities. The cumulative DAC and DSI amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative
charge or credit to income when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total EGP. When DAC or DSI
amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative (which would result in an increase of the DAC or DSI balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific
facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Negative
amortization is only recorded when the increased DAC or DSI balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances. Recapitalization of DAC and DSI is limited to the originally
deferred costs plus interest. 
       AGP
and EGP primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits; investment income and realized capital
gains and losses less interest credited; and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are investment returns,
including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of persistency, mortality, expenses, and hedges if
applicable. For products whose supporting investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of the Company's expectations which may cause periodic AGP to become temporarily negative, EGP and AGP
utilized in DAC and DSI amortization may be modified to exclude the excess capital losses. 
120




 










Table of Contents 
       The Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC and DSI recoverability for interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts in the aggregate
using current assumptions. If a change in the amount of EGP is significant, it could result in the unamortized DAC or DSI not being recoverable, resulting in a charge which is included as a component
of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively. 
       The
DAC and DSI balances presented include adjustments to reflect the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized capital gains or losses
in the respective product investment portfolios were actually realized. The adjustments are recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income. DAC, DSI and deferred income taxes determined
on unrealized capital gains and losses and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income recognize the impact on shareholders' equity consistently with the amounts that would be recognized in the
income statement on realized capital gains and losses. 
       Customers
of the Company may exchange one insurance policy or investment contract for another offered by the Company, or make modifications to an existing investment, life or
property-liability contract issued by the Company. These transactions are identified as internal replacements for accounting purposes. Internal replacement transactions determined to result in
replacement contracts that are substantially unchanged from the replaced contracts are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized DAC and DSI related to the replaced
contracts continue to be deferred and amortized in connection with the replacement contracts. For interest-sensitive life and investment contracts, the EGP of the replacement contracts are treated as
a revision to the EGP of the replaced contracts in the determination of amortization of DAC and DSI. For traditional life and property-liability insurance policies, any changes to unamortized DAC that
result from replacement contracts are treated as prospective revisions. Any costs associated with the issuance of replacement contracts are characterized as maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.
Internal replacement transactions determined to result in a substantial change to the replaced contracts are accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contracts, and any unamortized DAC and
DSI related to the replaced contracts are eliminated with a corresponding charge to amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively. 
       The
costs assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from certain business purchased from other insurers are also classified as DAC in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. The costs capitalized represent the present value of future profits expected to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired. These costs are amortized as profits emerge over the lives
of the acquired business and are periodically evaluated for recoverability. The present value of future profits was $136 million and $133 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Amortization expense of the present value of future profits was $39 million, $23 million and $28 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
 Reinsurance  
       In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing
reinsurance. The Company has also used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business. The amounts reported as reinsurance recoverables include amounts billed to
reinsurers on losses paid as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers on insurance liabilities and contractholder funds that have not yet been paid. Reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses are estimated based upon assumptions consistent with those used in establishing the liabilities related to the underlying reinsured contracts. Insurance liabilities are
reported gross of reinsurance recoverables. Reinsurance premiums are generally reflected in income in a manner consistent with the recognition of premiums on the reinsured contracts. For catastrophe
coverage, the cost of reinsurance premiums is recognized ratably over the contract period to the extent coverage remains available. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company's primary liability
under the policies written. Therefore, the Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers, including their activities with respect to claim settlement practices and
commutations, and establishes allowances for uncollectible reinsurance as appropriate. 
 Goodwill  
       Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
balances were $824 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2011 and $456 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2010 for the Allstate Protection
segment and the Allstate Financial segment, respectively. The increase in 2011 relates to the acquisition of Esurance and Answer
Financial. The Company's reporting units are equivalent to its reporting segments, Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment 
121

testing
during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter. The Company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such
as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value. 
       To
estimate the fair value of its reporting units, the Company may utilize a combination of widely accepted valuation techniques including a stock price and market capitalization
analysis, discounted cash flow calculations and peer company price to earnings multiples analysis. The stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price
of the Company's outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from historical insurance industry acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated
entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth, capital growth, earnings projections
including those used in the Company's strategic plan, and an appropriate discount rate. The peer company price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price earnings multiples of
peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from the Company's strategic plan. 
       Goodwill
impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. 
 Property and equipment  
       Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs
related to computer software licenses and software developed for internal use. These costs generally consist of certain external payroll and payroll related costs. Certain facilities and equipment
held under capital leases are also classified as property and equipment with the related lease obligations recorded as liabilities. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10 years for equipment and 40 years for real property. Depreciation expense is reported in
operating costs and expenses. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $2.29 billion and $2.41 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Depreciation
expense on property and equipment was $222 million, $239 million and $256 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for
impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
 Income taxes  
       The income tax provision is calculated under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. The principal assets and liabilities giving rise to such differences are DAC, unrealized
capital gains and losses on certain investments, differences in tax bases of invested assets, insurance reserves and unearned premiums. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when
there is uncertainty that such assets will be realized. 
 Reserves for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense and life-contingent contract benefits  
       The reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is the estimate of amounts necessary to settle all reported and
unreported claims for the ultimate cost of insured property-liability losses, based upon the facts of each case and the Company's experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and
subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process.
Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting reestimates are reflected in current results of operations. 
       The
reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance, life-contingent immediate annuities and
voluntary accident and health products, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses.
These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of
coverage, year of issue and policy duration. To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, the related increase in
reserves for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies is recorded net of tax as a reduction of unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
 Contractholder funds  
       Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life
insurance, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. Contractholder funds primarily comprise deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the contractholder less surrenders
and withdrawals, mortality 
122



 
Table of Contents
charges
and administrative expenses. Contractholder funds also include reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts and reserves for
certain guarantees on reinsured variable annuity contracts. 
 Separate accounts  
       Separate accounts assets are carried at fair value. The assets of the separate accounts are legally segregated and available only to
settle separate account contract obligations. Separate accounts liabilities represent the contractholders' claims to the related assets and are carried at an amount equal to the separate accounts
assets. Investment income and realized capital gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contractholders and therefore are not included in the Company's Consolidated Statements
of Operations. Deposits to and surrenders and withdrawals from the separate accounts are reflected in separate accounts liabilities and are not included in consolidated cash flows. 
       Absent
any contract provision wherein the Company provides a guarantee, variable annuity and variable life insurance contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts'
funds may not meet their stated investment objectives. Substantially all of the Company's variable annuity business was reinsured beginning in 2006. 
 Deferred Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") expense  
       Deferred ESOP expense represents the remaining unrecognized cost of shares acquired by the Allstate ESOP to pre-fund a
portion of the Company's contribution to the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan. 
 Equity incentive plans  
       The Company currently has equity incentive plans that permit the Company to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options
and restricted stock units ("equity awards") to certain employees and directors of the Company. The Company recognizes the fair value of equity awards computed at the award date over the period in
which the requisite service is rendered. The Company uses a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of employee stock options. 
 Off-balance-sheet financial instruments  
       Commitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to extend loans, financial guarantees and
credit guarantees have off-balance-sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (see Note 7 and
Note 14). 
 Consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs")  
       The Company consolidates VIEs when it is the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the entity with both the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to
the VIE (see Note 12). 
 Foreign currency translation  
       The local currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency of the country in which these
subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and
liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign
currency translation adjustments and included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been material. 
 Earnings per share  
       Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including unvested participating
restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. For the Company, dilutive potential common
shares consist of outstanding stock options and unvested non-participating restricted stock units.

       The effect of dilutive potential common shares does not include the effect of options with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per
share because their exercise prices exceed the average market price of Allstate common shares during the period or for which the unrecognized compensation cost would have an anti-dilutive
effect. Options to purchase 27.2 million, 26.7 million and 25.9 million Allstate common shares, with exercise prices ranging from $22.71 to $62.84, $27.36 to $64.53 and $23.13 to
$65.38, were outstanding in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share in those years. 
 Adopted accounting standards  
 Consolidation Analysis Considering Investments Held through Separate Accounts  
       In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance clarifying that an insurer is not required to combine
interests in investments held in a qualifying separate account with its interests in the same investments held in the general account when performing a consolidation evaluation. The adoption of this
guidance as of January 1, 2011 had no impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
 Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations  
       In December 2010, the FASB issued disclosure guidance for entities that enter into material business combinations. The guidance
specifies that if an entity presents comparative financial statements, it should disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during
the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature
and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination. The Company will apply the guidance to any material business combinations entered into on
or after January 1, 2011. 
 Criteria for Classification as a Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR")  
       In April 2011, the FASB issued clarifying guidance related to determining whether a loan modification or restructuring should be
classified as a TDR. The additional guidance provided pertains to the two criteria used to determine whether a TDR exists, whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether the debtor is
experiencing financial difficulties. The guidance related to the identification of a TDR is to be applied
retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. The measurement of impairment on a TDR identified under this guidance is effective prospectively. Additional disclosures about TDRs
of financing receivables are also required. The adoption of this guidance as of July 1, 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
 Pending accounting standards  
 Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts  
       In October 2010, the FASB issued guidance modifying the definition of the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that can be
capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts. The guidance specifies that the costs must be directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. The guidance
also specifies that advertising costs should be included as deferred acquisition costs only when the direct-response advertising accounting 
124



 
Table of Contents
criteria
are met. The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt the new guidance retrospectively. Upon adoption on
January 1, 2012, the DAC balance will be reduced by an estimated $571 million with a corresponding decrease to shareholders' equity of an estimated $375 million, net of taxes. In
future periods, operating costs and expenses will increase since a lower amount of acquisition costs will be capitalized, which will be partially offset by a decrease in amortization of DAC due to the
retrospective reduction of the DAC balance. 
 Criteria for Determining Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements  
       In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance modifying the assessment criteria of effective control for repurchase agreements. The new
guidance removes the criteria requiring an entity to have the ability to repurchase or redeem financial assets on substantially the agreed terms and the collateral maintenance guidance related to that
criteria. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur during reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
Early adoption is not permitted. The impact of adoption is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
 Amendments to Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements  
       In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and
amends certain fair value measurement principles, requirements and disclosures. Changes were made to improve consistency in global application. The guidance is to be applied prospectively for
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact of adoption is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations or financial
position. 
 Presentation of Comprehensive Income  
       In June and December 2011, the FASB issued guidance amending the presentation of comprehensive income and its components. Under the new
guidance, a reporting entity has the option to present comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance is effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is to be applied retrospectively. The new guidance affects presentation only and will have no impact on the Company's results of operations or
financial position. 
 Intangibles  Goodwill and Other  
       In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance providing the option to first assess qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions
and industry and market considerations, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If impairment is indicated by the
qualitative assessment, then it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If the option is not elected, the guidance requiring the two-step goodwill
impairment test is unchanged. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption
permitted. The impact of adoption is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
 Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities for Financial Instruments and Derivative Instruments  
       In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring expanded disclosures, including both gross and net information, for financial
instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in the reporting entity's financial statements or those that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar
agreement. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The new guidance affects disclosures only and will have no
impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
3.    Acquisition  
       On October 7, 2011, The Allstate Corporation acquired all of the shares of White Mountains, Inc. and Answer Financial Inc. ("Answer
Financial") from White Mountains Holdings (Luxembourg) S.à r.l. for $1.01 billion in cash. White Mountains, Inc. primarily comprises the Esurance insurance business
("Esurance"). Esurance sells private passenger auto insurance direct to consumers online, through a call center and through select agents, including Answer Financial. Answer Financial is an
independent personal lines insurance agency that offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from more than a dozen insurance companies through its website and over the phone. Esurance
expands the Company's ability to serve the self-directed, brand-sensitive market segment. Answer Financial strengthens the Company's offering to self-directed consumers who
want a choice between insurance carriers. 
125



 
Table of Contents
       In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded present value of future profits of $42 million, goodwill of $368 million, other intangible assets of
$426 million, reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense of $487 million, and unearned premiums of $229 million. 
4.    Supplemental Cash Flow Information  
       Non-cash investment exchanges, including modifications of certain mortgage loans (primarily refinances at maturity with no concessions granted to the
borrower), fixed income securities, limited partnerships and other investments, as well as mergers completed with equity securities, totaled $601 million, $664 million and
$485 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
       Liabilities
for collateral received in conjunction with the Company's securities lending program were $419 million, $461 million and $449 million as of
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are reported in other liabilities and accrued expenses. Obligations to return cash collateral for over-the-counter
("OTC") derivatives were $43 million, $23 million and $209 million as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are reported in other liabilities and accrued
expenses or other investments. The accompanying cash flows are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows along with the activities resulting from
management of the proceeds, which for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

       The Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed income security, discounted at the security's
original or current effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss exists. The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and
methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts, are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes,
but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected
defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, geographic concentration, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third party guarantees and other
credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other
market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if the Company determines
that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. If the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security, a credit loss exists and an
other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings. The portion of the unrealized loss related
to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the Company determines that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other
information to estimate a recovery value for the security, the Company may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.

(1)Included
in the fair value of derivative instruments are $(5) million classified as assets and $7 million classified as liabilities. (2)Unrealized
net capital gains and losses for limited partnership interests represent the Company's share of EMA limited partnerships' other
comprehensive income. Fair value and gross gains and losses are not applicable.  (3)The
insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the
applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency. Although the Company evaluates premium deficiencies on the combined
performance of life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, in addition to annuity
buy-outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies.  (4)The
DAC and DSI adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized
gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.

 Portfolio monitoring  
       The Company has a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose
carrying value may be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
       For
each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more
likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets
either of these criteria, the security's decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings. 
       If
the Company has not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before
recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company calculates the
estimated recovery value by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, and compares this to the amortized cost of the
security. If the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, the credit loss component of the impairment is
recorded in earnings, with the remaining amount of the unrealized loss related to other factors recognized in other comprehensive income. 
       For
equity securities, the Company considers various factors, including whether it has the intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover its
cost basis. Where the Company lacks the intent and ability to hold to recovery, or believes the recovery period is extended, the equity security's decline in fair value is considered other than
temporary and is recorded in earnings. For equity securities managed by a third party, the Company has contractually retained its decision making authority as it pertains to selling equity securities
that are in an unrealized loss position. 
       The
Company's portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost (for
fixed income securities) or cost (for equity securities) is below established thresholds. The process also includes the monitoring of other impairment indicators such as ratings, ratings downgrades
and payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which the Company may have a concern, are evaluated for potential other-than-temporary
impairment using all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security. Inherent in the Company's evaluation of other-than-temporary
impairment for these fixed income and equity securities are assumptions and estimates about the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer. Some of the factors that may
be considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary are: 1) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or
issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 2) the specific reasons that a
security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than
amortized cost or cost.

       As of December 31, 2011, $634 million of unrealized losses are related to securities with an unrealized loss position less than 20%
of amortized cost or cost, the degree of which suggests that these securities do not pose a high risk of being other-than-temporarily impaired. Of the $634 million,
$363 million are related to unrealized losses on investment grade fixed income securities. Investment grade is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody's, a rating
of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch, Dominion or Realpoint, a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from A.M. Best, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available.
Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to widening credit spreads or rising interest rates since the time of initial purchase. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the remaining $1.25 billion of unrealized losses are related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of amortized
cost or cost. Investment grade fixed income securities comprising $482 million of these unrealized losses were evaluated based on factors such as expected cash flows and the financial condition
and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations. Of the $1.25 billion,
$693 million are related to below investment grade fixed income securities and $70 million are related to equity securities. Of these amounts, $486 million of the below investment
grade fixed income securities had been in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for a period of twelve or more consecutive months as of December 31, 2011.
Unrealized losses on below investment grade securities are principally related to RMBS, CMBS and ABS and were the result of wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since the time of
initial purchase, largely due to macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration, including the impact of lower real estate valuations. 
132



 
Table of Contents
       RMBS,
CMBS and ABS in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on actual and projected collateral losses relative to the securities' positions in the respective securitization
trusts, security specific expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings. This evaluation also takes into consideration credit enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination from other
classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to absorb losses before the class of security the Company owns, (ii) the expected impact of other structural features
embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the class of securities the Company owns, such as overcollateralization and excess spread, and (iii) for RMBS and ABS in an unrealized loss
position, credit enhancements from reliable bond insurers, where applicable. Municipal bonds in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on the quality of the underlying securities. Unrealized
losses on equity securities are primarily related to temporary equity market fluctuations of securities that are expected to recover. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the Company has not made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell fixed income securities with
unrealized losses before recovery of the amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had the intent and ability to hold equity securities with unrealized losses for a period of
time sufficient for them to recover. 
 Limited partnerships  
       As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the carrying value of equity method limited partnership interests totaled
$3.13 billion and $2.47 billion, respectively. The Company recognizes an impairment loss for equity method investments when evidence demonstrates that the loss is other than temporary.
Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of
earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had write-downs related to equity method limited partnership interests of $2 million,
$1 million and $11 million, respectively. 
       As
of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the carrying value for cost method limited partnership interests was $1.57 billion and $1.35 billion,
respectively. To determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the Company evaluates whether an impairment indicator has occurred in the period that may have a
significant adverse effect on the carrying value of the investment. Impairment indicators may include: significantly reduced valuations of the investments held by the limited partnerships; actual
recent cash flows received being significantly less than expected cash flows; reduced valuations based on financing completed at a lower value; completed sale of a material underlying investment at a
price significantly lower than expected; or any other adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the fair value of the investee's capital. Additionally, the
Company's portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly review of all cost method limited partnerships to identify instances where the net asset value is below established thresholds for certain
periods of time, as well as investments that are performing below expectations, for further impairment consideration. If a cost method limited partnership is
other-than-temporarily impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value, generally estimated to be equivalent to the reported net asset value of the underlying funds.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had write-downs related to cost method investments of $4 million, $45 million and $297 million, respectively. 
 Mortgage loans  
       The Company's mortgage loans are commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a variety of commercial real estate property types located
throughout the United States and totaled, net of valuation allowance, $7.14 billion and $6.68 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of the
commercial mortgage loans are non-recourse to the borrower. The following table shows the principal geographic distribution of commercial real estate represented in the Company's mortgage
loan portfolio. No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio as of December 31.

       Mortgage loans are evaluated for impairment on a specific loan basis through a quarterly credit monitoring process and review of key credit
quality indicators. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will not collect the contractual principal and interest. Valuation allowances are established for
impaired loans to reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell or the present value of the loan's expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan's
original effective interest rate. Impaired mortgage loans may not have a valuation allowance when the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is higher than the carrying value. Mortgage loan
valuation allowances are charged off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The impairment evaluation is non-statistical in respect to the aggregate portfolio but considers
facts and circumstances attributable to each loan. It is not considered probable
that additional impairment losses, beyond those identified on a specific loan basis, have been incurred as of December 31, 2011. 
       Accrual
of income is suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Cash receipts on mortgage
loans on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of carrying value. 
       Debt
service coverage ratio is considered a key credit quality indicator when mortgage loans are evaluated for impairment. Debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of estimated
cash flows from the property available to the borrower to meet principal and interest payment obligations. Debt service coverage ratio estimates are updated annually or more frequently if conditions
are warranted based on the Company's credit monitoring process.

       Mortgage loans with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.0 that are not considered impaired primarily relate to instances where the borrower has the financial
capacity to fund the revenue shortfalls from the properties for the foreseeable term, the decrease in cash flows from the properties is considered temporary, or there are other risk mitigating
circumstances such as additional collateral, escrow balances or borrower guarantees.

6.    Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities  
       Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs
be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of
inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 















Level 1:
 
Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company can access.


Level 2:
 
Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:



 
 
 (a)
 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;



 
 
 (b)
 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or



 
 
 (c)
 
 Valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.


Level 3:
 
Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the
Company's estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities.




       The availability of observable inputs varies by instrument. In situations where fair value is based on internally developed pricing models or inputs that are
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is typically greatest for instruments
categorized in Level 3. In many instances, valuation inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The category level in the fair value hierarchy is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including
during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. 
       The
Company has two types of situations where investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The first is where quotes continue to be received from independent
third-party valuation service providers and all significant inputs are market observable; however, there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared
to normal market activity such that the degree of market observability has declined to a point where categorization as a Level 3 measurement is considered appropriate. The indicators considered
in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the
secondary market,
the level of credit spreads over historical levels, applicable bid-ask spreads, and price consensus among market participants and other pricing sources. 
       The
second situation where the Company classifies securities in Level 3 is where specific inputs significant to the fair value estimation models are not market observable. This
occurs in two primary instances. The first relates to the Company's use of broker quotes to value certain securities where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable. The second
relates to auction rate securities ("ARS") backed by student loans for which a key input, the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market, is not market observable. 
       Certain
assets are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis, including investments such as mortgage loans, limited partnership interests, bank loans and policy loans. Accordingly,
such investments are only included in the fair value hierarchy disclosure when the investment is subject to remeasurement at fair value after initial recognition and the resulting remeasurement is
reflected in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, derivatives embedded in fixed 
136



 
Table of Contents
income
securities are not disclosed in the hierarchy as free-standing derivatives since they are presented with the host contracts in fixed income securities. 
       In
determining fair value, the Company principally uses the market approach which generally utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar instruments. To a lesser extent, the
Company uses the income approach which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies. For the majority of Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, a combination of the
market and income approaches is used. 
 Summary of significant valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  
Level 1
measurements 


Fixed income securities:  Comprise U.S. Treasuries. Valuation is based on
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company can access. 
Equity securities:  Comprise actively traded, exchange-listed U.S. and
international equity securities. Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company can access. 
Short-term:  Comprise actively traded money market funds that have
daily quoted net asset values for identical assets that the Company can access. 
Separate account assets:  Comprise actively traded mutual funds that have daily
quoted net asset values for identical assets that the Company can access. Net asset values for the actively traded mutual funds in which the separate account assets are invested are obtained daily
from the fund managers. 

Level 2
measurements 


Fixed income securities: 



U.S. government and agencies:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are
not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. 
Municipal:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active,
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. 
Corporate, including privately placed:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets
that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Also included are privately placed securities valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the
financial services industry and uses market observable inputs and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. The primary inputs to the discounted cash flow model
include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets in markets that are not active that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. 
Foreign government:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not
active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. 
RMBS and ABS:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active,
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance and credit spreads. Certain ABS are valued based on non-binding broker quotes whose inputs have been
corroborated to be market observable. 
CMBS:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual
cash flows, benchmark yields, collateral performance and credit spreads. 
Redeemable preferred stock:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are
not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, underlying stock prices and credit spreads. 


Equity securities:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or
quoted net asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active. 
Short-term:  The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted
prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. For certain short-term investments, amortized cost is
used as the best estimate of fair value. 

137



 
Table of Contents


Other investments:  Free-standing exchange listed derivatives that
are not actively traded are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active. 



OTC
derivatives, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, certain options and certain credit default swaps, are valued using models that rely on
inputs such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates, and counterparty credit spreads that are observable for substantially the full term of the
contract. The valuation techniques underlying the models are widely accepted in the financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment. 


Level 3
measurements 


Fixed income securities: 



Municipal:  ARS primarily backed by student loans that have become illiquid due to failures in the auction market are valued using a
discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses significant non-market observable inputs, including estimates of future coupon rates if
auction failures continue, the anticipated date liquidity will return to the market and illiquidity premium. Also included are municipal bonds that are not rated by third party credit rating agencies
but are rated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The primary inputs to the valuation of these municipal bonds include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in
markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. 
Corporate, including privately placed:  Primarily valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been
corroborated to be market observable. Also included are equity-indexed notes which are valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses
significant non-market observable inputs, such as volatility. Other inputs include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets that incorporate the
credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. 
RMBS, CMBS and ABS:  Valued based on non-binding broker quotes received from brokers who are familiar with the investments and
where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable. 


Other investments:  Certain OTC derivatives, such as interest rate caps and
floors, certain credit default swaps and certain options (including swaptions), are valued using models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry. These are categorized as
Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs such as volatility. Other primary inputs include interest rate yield curves and credit spreads.  
Contractholder funds:  Derivatives embedded in certain life and annuity contracts
are valued internally using models widely accepted in the financial services industry that determine a single best estimate of fair value for the embedded derivatives within a block of contractholder
liabilities. The models primarily use stochastically determined cash flows based on the contractual elements of embedded derivatives, projected option cost and applicable market data, such as interest
rate yield curves and equity index volatility assumptions. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs. 

 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis  
       Mortgage loans written-down to fair value in connection with recognizing impairments are valued based on the fair value of
the underlying collateral less costs to sell. Limited partnership interests written-down to fair value in connection with recognizing other-than-temporary
impairments are valued using net asset values.

(1)The
effect to net income totals $(860) million and is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:
$(901) million in realized capital gains and losses, $73 million in net investment income, $(1) million in interest credited to contractholder funds and $(31) million in life and annuity
contract benefits.  (2)Comprises
$74 million of assets and $95 million of liabilities. 

       Transfers between level categorizations may occur due to changes in the availability of market observable inputs, which generally are caused by
changes in market conditions such as liquidity, trading volume or bid-ask spreads. Transfers between level categorizations may also occur due to changes in the valuation source. For
example, in situations where a fair value quote is not provided by the Company's independent third-party valuation service provider and as a result the price is stale or has been replaced with a
broker quote whose inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, the security is transferred into Level 3. Transfers in and out of level categorizations are reported as having
occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Therefore, for all transfers into Level 3, all realized and changes in unrealized gains and losses in the quarter of
transfer are reflected in the Level 3 rollforward table. 
       There
were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2011 or 2010. 
       During
2011, certain RMBS, CMBS and ABS were transferred into Level 2 from Level 3 as a result of increased liquidity in the market and a sustained increase in market
activity for these assets. Additionally, certain ABS that are valued based on non-binding broker quotes were transferred into Level 2 from Level 3 since the inputs were
corroborated to be market observable. During 2010, certain CMBS and ABS were transferred into Level 2 from Level 3 as a result of increased liquidity in the market and a sustained
increase in market activity for these assets. When transferring these securities into Level 2, the Company did not change the source of fair value estimates or modify the estimates received
from independent third-party valuation service providers or the internal valuation approach. Accordingly, for securities included within this group, there was no change in fair value in conjunction
with the transfer resulting in a realized or unrealized gain or loss. 
       Transfers
into Level 3 during 2011 and 2010 included situations where a fair value quote was not provided by the Company's independent third-party valuation service provider and
as a result the price was stale or had been replaced with a broker quote where inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable resulting in the security being classified as Level 3.
Transfers out of Level 3 during 2011 and 2010 included situations where a broker quote was used in

the
prior period and a fair value quote became available from the Company's independent third-party valuation service provider in the current period. A quote utilizing the new pricing source was not
available as of the prior period, and any gains or losses related to the change in valuation source for individual securities were not significant.

       The fair value of mortgage loans is based on discounted contractual cash flows or, if the loans are impaired due to credit reasons, the fair value
of collateral less costs to sell. Risk adjusted discount rates are selected using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar characteristics, using similar types of
properties as collateral. The fair value of limited partnership interests accounted for on the cost basis is determined using reported net asset values of the underlying funds. The fair value of bank
loans, which are reported in other investments, is based on broker quotes from brokers familiar with the loans and current market conditions.

       The fair value of contractholder funds on investment contracts is based on the terms of the underlying contracts utilizing prevailing market rates
for similar contracts adjusted for the Company's own credit risk. Deferred annuities included in contractholder funds are valued using discounted cash flow models which incorporate market value
margins, which are based on the cost of holding economic capital, and the Company's own credit risk. Immediate annuities without life contingencies and fixed rate funding agreements are valued at the
present value of future benefits using market implied interest rates which include the Company's own credit risk. 
       The
fair value of long-term debt is based on market observable data (such as the fair value of the debt when traded as an asset) or, in certain cases, is determined using
discounted cash flow calculations based on current interest rates for instruments with comparable terms and considers the Company's own credit risk. The liability for collateral is valued at carrying
value due to its short-term nature. 
7.    Derivative Financial Instruments and Off-balance-sheet Financial Instruments  
       The Company uses derivatives to manage risks with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impacts from changes in risk-free
interest rates, negative equity market valuations, increases in credit spreads and foreign currency fluctuations, and for asset replication. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative
purposes. 
       Property-Liability
uses interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures and options to manage the interest rate risks of existing investments and to reduce exposure to rising or falling interest
rates. Portfolio duration management is a risk management strategy that is principally employed by Property-Liability wherein financial futures and interest rate swaps are utilized to change the
duration of the portfolio in order to offset the economic effect that interest rates would otherwise have on the fair value of its fixed income securities. Equity index futures and options are used by
Property-Liability to offset valuation losses in the equity portfolio during periods of declining equity market values. Credit default swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the
Property-Liability fixed income portfolio. Property-Liability uses futures to hedge the market risk related to deferred compensation liability contracts and forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
risk associated with holding foreign currency denominated investments and foreign operations. 
       Asset-liability
management is a risk management strategy that is principally employed by Allstate Financial to balance the respective interest-rate sensitivities of its
assets and liabilities. Depending upon the attributes of the assets acquired and liabilities issued, derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors, swaptions and futures are
utilized to change the interest rate characteristics of existing assets and liabilities to ensure the relationship is maintained within specified ranges and to reduce exposure to rising or falling
interest rates. Allstate Financial uses financial futures and interest rate swaps to hedge anticipated asset purchases and liability issuances and futures and options for hedging the equity exposure
contained in its equity indexed life and annuity product contracts that offer equity returns to contractholders. In addition, Allstate Financial uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk
inherent in funding agreements. Allstate Financial uses foreign currency swaps and forward contracts primarily to reduce the foreign currency risk associated with issuing foreign currency denominated
funding agreements and holding foreign currency denominated investments. Credit default swaps are also typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the Allstate Financial fixed income portfolio. 
       Asset
replication refers to the "synthetic" creation of assets through the use of derivatives and primarily investment grade host bonds to replicate securities that are either
unavailable in the cash markets or more economical to acquire in synthetic form. The Company replicates fixed income securities using a combination of a credit default swap and one or more highly
rated fixed income securities to synthetically replicate the economic characteristics of one or more cash market securities. The Company also creates "synthetic" exposure to equity markets through the
use of exchange traded equity index future contracts and an investment grade host bond. 
       The
Company also has derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are required to be separated from the host contracts and accounted for at fair value. The
Company's primary embedded derivatives are equity options in life and annuity product contracts, which provide equity returns to contractholders; equity-indexed notes 
145



 
Table of Contents
containing
equity call options, which provide a coupon payout that is determined using one or more equity-based indices; credit default swaps in synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which
provide enhanced coupon rates as a result of selling credit protection; and conversion options in fixed income securities, which provide the Company with the right to convert the instrument into a
predetermined number of shares of common stock. 
       When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow
hedges. Allstate Financial designates certain of its interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements as fair value hedges when the hedging
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Allstate Financial designates certain of its foreign currency swap contracts as cash flow hedges
when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the exposure of variations in cash flows for the hedged risk that could affect net income. Amounts are reclassified to net investment
income or realized capital gains and losses as the hedged item affects net income. 
       The
notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are generally not representative of the potential for
gain or loss on these agreements. However, the notional amounts specified in credit default swaps where the Company has sold credit protection represent the maximum amount of potential loss, assuming
no recoveries. 
       Fair
value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. The carrying
value amounts for OTC derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, of legally enforceable master netting agreements and are presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For certain exchange traded derivatives, the exchange requires margin deposits as well as daily cash settlements of margin accounts. As of
December 31, 2011, the Company pledged $11 million of securities in the form of margin deposits. 
       For
those derivatives which qualify for fair value hedge accounting, net income includes the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged risk, and
therefore reflects any hedging ineffectiveness. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income and are reported in net income in the same period the
forecasted transactions being hedged impact net income. For embedded derivatives in fixed income securities, net income includes the change in fair value of the embedded derivative and accretion
income related to the host instrument. 
       Non-hedge
accounting is generally used for "portfolio" level hedging strategies where the terms of the individual hedged items do not meet the strict homogeneity requirements
to permit the application of hedge accounting. For non-hedge derivatives, net income includes changes in fair value and accrued periodic settlements, when applicable. With the exception of
non-hedge derivatives used for asset replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of the Company's derivatives are evaluated for their ongoing effectiveness as either
accounting hedge or non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis.

       The
Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements
("MNAs") and obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses MNAs for OTC derivative transactions that permit either party to net payments due for transactions and collateral is either
pledged or obtained when certain predetermined exposure limits are
exceeded. As of December 31, 2011, counterparties pledged $64 million in cash and securities to the Company, and the Company pledged $82 million in cash and securities to
counterparties which includes $76 million of collateral posted under MNAs for contracts containing credit-risk-contingent provisions that are in a liability position and
$6 million of collateral posted under MNAs for contracts without credit-risk-contingent liabilities. The Company has not incurred any losses on derivative financial
instruments due to counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives, including futures and certain option contracts, are traded on organized exchanges which require margin deposits and guarantee the
execution of trades, thereby mitigating any potential credit risk. 
       Counterparty
credit exposure represents the Company's potential loss if all of the counterparties concurrently fail to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all
collateral, if any, becomes worthless. This exposure is

(1)Rating
is the lower of S&P or Moody's ratings.  (2)Only
OTC derivatives with a net positive fair value are included for each counterparty. 

       Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the
derivative financial instruments the Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company's senior
management has established risk control limits. In addition, changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments that the Company uses for risk management purposes are generally offset by
the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged risk component of the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions. 
       Certain
of the Company's derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent termination events, cross-default provisions and credit support annex agreements.
Credit-risk-contingent termination events allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative on certain dates if AIC's, ALIC's or Allstate Life Insurance Company of New
York's ("ALNY") financial strength credit ratings by Moody's or S&P fall below a certain level or in the event AIC, ALIC or ALNY are no longer rated by both Moody's and S&P.
Credit-risk-contingent cross-default provisions allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative instruments if the Company defaults by pre-determined threshold
amounts on certain debt instruments. Credit-risk-contingent credit support annex agreements specify the amount of collateral the Company must post to counterparties based on
AIC's, ALIC's or ALNY's financial strength credit ratings by Moody's or S&P, or in the event AIC, ALIC or ALNY are no longer rated by both Moody's and S&P. 
       The
following summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments with termination, cross-default or collateral credit-risk-contingent features that are in a
liability position as of December 31, as well as the fair value of assets and collateral that are netted against the liability in accordance with provisions within legally enforceable MNAs.

 Credit derivatives  selling protection  
       Free-standing credit default swaps ("CDS") are utilized for selling credit protection against a specified credit event. A
credit default swap is a derivative instrument, representing an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of a specified entity (or a group of entities), or an index based on the
credit risk of a group of entities (all commonly referred to as the "reference entity" or a portfolio of "reference entities"), in return for a periodic premium. In selling protection, CDS are used to
replicate fixed income securities and to complement the cash market when credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or when the derivative alternative is less expensive than the cash market
alternative. CDS typically have a five-year term.

       In selling protection with CDS, the Company sells credit protection on an identified single name, a basket of names in a
first-to-default ("FTD") structure or a specific tranche of a basket, or credit derivative index ("CDX") that is generally investment grade, and in return receives periodic
premiums through expiration or termination of the agreement. With single name CDS, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the reference entity's
public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed. With a FTD basket or a tranche of a basket, because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of
named reference entities, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket and the correlation between the names. CDX index is
utilized to take a position on multiple (generally 125) reference entities. Credit events are typically defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring, depending on the nature of the
reference entities. If a credit event occurs, the Company settles with the counterparty, either through physical settlement or cash settlement. In a physical settlement, a reference asset is delivered
by the buyer of protection to the Company, in exchange for cash payment at par, whereas in a cash settlement, the Company pays the difference between par and the prescribed value of the reference
asset. When a credit event occurs in a single name or FTD basket (for FTD, the first credit event occurring for any one name in the basket), the contract terminates at the time of settlement. When a
credit event occurs in a tranche of a basket, there is no immediate impact to the Company until cumulative losses in the basket exceed the contractual subordination. To date, realized losses have not
exceeded the subordination. For CDX index, the reference entity's name incurring the credit event is removed from the index while the contract continues until expiration. The maximum payout on a CDS
is the contract notional amount. A physical settlement may afford the Company with recovery rights as the new owner of the asset.

Table of Contents 
       The Company monitors risk associated with credit derivatives through individual name credit limits at both a credit derivative and a combined cash
instrument/credit derivative level. The ratings of individual names for which protection has been sold are also monitored. 
       In
addition to the CDS described above, the Company's synthetic collateralized debt obligations contain embedded credit default swaps which sell protection on a basket of reference
entities. The synthetic collateralized debt obligations are fully funded; therefore, the Company is not obligated to contribute additional funds when credit events occur related to the reference
entities named in the embedded credit default swaps. The Company's maximum amount at risk equals the amount of its aggregate initial investment in the synthetic collateralized debt obligations. 
 Off-balance-sheet financial instruments  
       The contractual amounts of off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of December 31 are as follows:

 Private placement commitments

 Other loan commitments

       In the preceding table, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and
the value of any underlying security becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance-sheet financial instruments
with credit risk. 
       Commitments
to invest generally represent commitments to acquire financial interests or instruments. The Company enters into these agreements to allow for additional participation in
certain limited partnership investments. Because the equity investments in the limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments. 
       Commitments
to extend mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters into these
agreements to commit to future loan fundings at a predetermined interest rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. The fair value of commitments to extend mortgage loans, which are secured by the underlying properties, is $1 million as of December 31, 2011, and is valued based on estimates
of fees charged by other institutions to make similar commitments to similar borrowers. 
       Private
placement commitments represent conditional commitments to purchase private placement debt and equity securities at a specified future date. The Company regularly enters into
these agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of these commitments generally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying
private placement securities are not yet final. 
       Other
loan commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters into these agreements to
commit to future loan fundings at predetermined interest rates. Commitments generally have fixed or varying expiration dates or other termination clauses. The fair value of these commitments is
insignificant. 
8.    Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense  
       As described in Note 2, the Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense ("loss") on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. The
Company's reserving process takes into account known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including the Company's experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends
involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic
conditions. In the normal course of business, the Company may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and
information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. 
       Because
reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including
reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. The
highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses 
156



 
Table of Contents
incurred
in the current reporting period as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled. The Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information
becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property-liability insurance
claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined. 
       Activity
in the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is summarized as follows:

       Incurred claims and claims expense represents the sum of paid losses and reserve changes in the calendar year. This expense includes losses from
catastrophes of $3.82 billion, $2.21 billion and $2.07 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net of reinsurance and other recoveries (see Note 10). Catastrophes are
an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business that have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's
results of operations and financial position. 
       The
Company calculates and records a single best reserve estimate for losses from catastrophes, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards. As a result, management
believes that no other estimate is better than the recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, including the factors described above, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from
recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. Accordingly, management believes that it is not practical to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred. 
       During
2011, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in auto reserves of $381 million primarily due to claim severity
development that was better than expected, net decreases in homeowners reserves of $69 million due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates, and net increases in other reserves of
$94 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss reestimates of $130 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries. 
       During
2010, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in auto reserves of $179 million primarily due to claim severity
development that was better than expected partially offset by a litigation settlement, net decreases in homeowners reserves of $23 million due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates
partially offset by a litigation settlement, and net increases in other reserves of $15 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss reestimates of
$163 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries. 
       During
2009, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in homeowners and auto reserves of $168 million and
$57 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in other reserves of $89 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss reestimates of
$169 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, primarily attributable to favorable reserve reestimates from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and a catastrophe related subrogation recovery. 
       Management
believes that the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, net of reinsurance recoverables, is appropriately established in the aggregate and
adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of reported and

       The Company offered various guarantees to variable annuity contractholders. Liabilities for variable contract guarantees related to death benefits
are included in the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits and the liabilities related to the income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits are included in contractholder funds. All
liabilities for variable contract guarantees are reported on a gross basis on the balance sheet with a corresponding reinsurance recoverable asset for those contracts subject to reinsurance. In 2006,
the Company disposed of substantially all of its variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with Prudential. 
       Absent
any contract provision wherein the Company guarantees either a minimum return or account value upon death, a specified contract anniversary date, partial withdrawal or
annuitization, variable annuity and variable life insurance contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts' funds may not meet their stated investment objectives. The account
balances of variable annuities contracts' separate accounts with guarantees included $5.54 billion and $6.94 billion of equity, fixed income and balanced mutual funds and
$837 million and $1.09 billion of money market mutual funds as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
       The
table below presents information regarding the Company's variable annuity contracts with guarantees. The Company's variable annuity contracts may offer more than one type of
guarantee in each contract; therefore, the sum of amounts listed exceeds the total account balances of variable annuity contracts' separate accounts with guarantees.

Table of Contents
       The liability for death and income benefit guarantees is equal to a benefit ratio multiplied by the cumulative contract charges earned, plus
accrued interest less contract excess guarantee benefit payments. The benefit ratio is calculated as the estimated present value of all expected contract excess guarantee benefits divided by the
present value of all expected contract charges. The establishment of reserves for these guarantees requires the projection of future fund values, mortality, persistency and customer benefit
utilization rates. These assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated. For guarantees related to death benefits, benefits represent the projected excess guaranteed minimum death benefit payments.
For guarantees related to income benefits, benefits represent the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuitization benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the time of
annuitization. 
       Projected
benefits and contract charges used in determining the liability for certain guarantees are developed using models and stochastic scenarios that are also used in the development
of estimated expected gross profits. Underlying assumptions for the liability related to income benefits include assumed future annuitization elections based on factors such as the extent of benefit
to the potential annuitant, eligibility conditions and the annuitant's attained age. The liability for guarantees is re-evaluated periodically, and adjustments are made to the liability
balance through a charge or credit to life and annuity contract benefits. 
       Guarantees
related to the majority of withdrawal and accumulation benefits are considered to be derivative financial instruments; therefore, the liability for these benefits is
established based on its fair value.

 Property-Liability  
       The Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of
coverage. Developments in the insurance and reinsurance industries have fostered a movement to segregate asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities
with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. The Company is unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability
of reinsurance recoverables in the future. 
 Property-Liability reinsurance recoverable  
       Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $2.67 billion and $2.15 billion,
respectively, including $86 million and $81 million, respectively, related to property-liability losses paid by the Company and billed to reinsurers, and $2.59 billion and
$2.07 billion, respectively, estimated by the Company with respect to ceded unpaid losses (including IBNR), which are not billable until the losses are paid. 
       With
the exception of the recoverable balances from the Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA"), Lloyd's of London and other industry pools and facilities, the largest
reinsurance recoverable balance the Company had outstanding was $98 million and $56 million from Westport Insurance Corporation (formerly Employers' Reinsurance Company) as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. No other amount due or estimated to be due from any single property-liability reinsurer was in excess of $36 million and $37 million as
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
       The
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $103 million and $142 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is related to the Company's
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. 
 Industry pools and facilities  
       Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims including IBNR as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 includes $1.71 billion
and $1.24 billion, respectively, from the MCCA. The MCCA is a mandatory reinsurance mechanism for personal injury protection losses over a retention level that increases each MCCA fiscal year.
The retention levels are $500 thousand per claim and $480 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The MCCA is funded by assessments
from member companies who, in turn, can recover assessments from policyholders. 
       Ceded
premiums earned under the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF") agreement were $27 million, $15 million and $13 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Ceded losses incurred include $8 million, $10 million and $47 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has access to reimbursement provided by the
FHCF for 90% of qualifying personal property losses that exceed its current retention of $100 million for the two largest

hurricanes
and $33 million for other hurricanes, up to a maximum total of $349 million effective from June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012. Reinsurance recoverables from the FHCF
were zero as of December 31, 2011 due to a commutation finalized in July 2011. Reinsurance recoverables include $41 million recoverable from the FHCF for qualifying property losses as of
December 31, 2010. 
       Allstate
sells and administers policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). The total amounts recoverable as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were
$33 million and $10 million, respectively. Ceded premiums earned include $312 million, $306 million and $298 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ceded
losses incurred include $196 million, $50 million and $111 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Under the arrangement, the Federal Government is obligated to pay all
claims. 
 Catastrophe reinsurance  
       The Company has the following catastrophe reinsurance treaties in effect as of December 31,
2011:


Nationwide Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprising three contracts, all incepting as of
June 1, 2011 and with one, two and three year terms. This agreement reinsures Allstate Protection personal lines auto and property business countrywide, in all states except Florida and New
Jersey, for excess catastrophe losses caused by multiple perils. The contracts are placed in six layers, with the first five layers subject to reinstatement, and cover $3.25 billion in per
occurrence losses in excess of a $500 million retention and after $250 million in losses "otherwise recoverable." Losses from multiple qualifying occurrences can apply to this
$250 million threshold which applies once to each contract year and only to the agreement's first layer. 
Top and Drop Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprising an annual contract and a three year term contract, both
incepting as of June 1, 2011, and providing $250 million of reinsurance limits which may be used for Coverage A, Coverage B, or a combination of both. Coverage A reinsures 47.5% of
$500 million in limits excess of a $3.25 billion retention. Coverage B provides 95% of $250 million in limits excess of a $750 million retention and after
$500 million in losses "otherwise recoverable" under the agreement. Losses from multiple qualifying occurrences can apply to this $500 million threshold. 

       Losses
recoverable under the Company's New Jersey, Kentucky and Pennsylvania reinsurance agreements, described below, are disregarded when determining coverage under the Nationwide Per
Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement and the Top and Drop Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement. 


New Jersey Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement, comprising three contracts each with a three year duration and
effective respectively June 1, 2009, June 1, 2010, and June 1, 2011, provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property excess catastrophe losses for multiple
perils in New Jersey. Effective June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012, one contract provides 32% of a $400 million limit excess of a $150 million retention with one prepaid
reinstatement. The other two contracts are placed in two layers: the first layer provides 63% of $300 million of limits in excess of a $200 million retention, and the second layer
provides 68% of $200 million of limits in excess of a $500 million retention. 
Kentucky Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property excess
catastrophe losses in the state for earthquakes and fires following earthquakes effective June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2014. The agreement provides three limits of $25 million excess
of a $5 million retention subject to two limits being available in any one contract year and is 95% placed. 
Pennsylvania Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property
excess catastrophe losses in the state for multi-perils effective June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012. The agreement provides three limits of $100 million excess of a
$100 million retention subject to two limits being available in any one contract year and is 95% placed. 
Five separate agreements for Castle Key Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ("Castle Key") provide coverage for
personal lines property excess catastrophe losses in Florida and coordinate coverage with the Company's participation in the FHCF, effective June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012. The agreements,
including agreements that provide coverage through the FHCF, provide an estimated provisional limit of $916.7 million in excess of a provisional retention of $30 million and after
$10 million in losses "otherwise recoverable". 

       The
Company ceded premiums earned of $531 million, $582 million and $616 million under catastrophe reinsurance agreements in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

 Asbestos, environmental and other  
       Reinsurance recoverables include $193 million and $183 million from Lloyd's of London as of December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. Lloyd's of London, through the creation of Equitas Limited, implemented a restructuring plan in 1996 to solidify its capital base and to segregate claims for years prior to 1993. 
 Allstate Financial  
       The Company's Allstate Financial segment reinsures certain of its risks to other insurers primarily under yearly renewable term,
coinsurance, modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld agreements. These agreements result in a passing of the agreed-upon percentage of risk to the reinsurer in exchange
for negotiated reinsurance premium payments. Modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld are similar to coinsurance, except that the cash and investments that support the liability for
contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming company and settlements are made on a net basis between the companies. Allstate Financial cedes 100% of the morbidity risk on substantially all of
its long-term care contracts. 
       For
certain term life insurance policies issued prior to October 2009, Allstate Financial ceded up to 90% of the mortality risk depending on the year of policy issuance under coinsurance
agreements to a pool of fourteen unaffiliated reinsurers. Effective October 2009, mortality risk on term business is ceded under yearly renewable term agreements under which Allstate Financial cedes
mortality in excess of its retention, which is consistent with how Allstate Financial generally reinsures its permanent life insurance business. The following table summarizes those retention limits
by period of policy issuance. 











Period 
 
Retention limits 


April 2011 through current
 
Single life: $5 million per life, $3 million age 70 and over, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria



 
 
Joint life: $8 million per life, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria


July 2007 through March 2011
 
$5 million per life, $3 million age 70 and over, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria


September 1998 through June 2007
 
$2 million per life, in 2006 the limit was increased to $5 million for instances when specific criteria were met


August 1998 and prior
 
Up to $1 million per life




       In addition, Allstate Financial has used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business. Allstate Financial
had reinsurance recoverables of $1.68 billion and $1.63 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due from Prudential related to the disposal of substantially all of
its variable annuity business that was effected through reinsurance agreements. In 2011, life and annuity premiums and contract charges of $152 million, contract benefits of
$121 million, interest credited to contractholder funds of $20 million, and operating costs and expenses of $27 million were ceded to Prudential. In 2010, life and annuity
premiums and contract charges of $171 million, contract benefits of $152 million, interest credited to contractholder funds of $29 million, and operating costs and expenses of
$31 million were ceded to Prudential. In 2009, life and annuity premiums and contract charges of $170 million, contract benefits of $44 million, interest credited to
contractholder funds of $27 million, and operating costs and expenses of $28 million were ceded to Prudential. In addition, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 Allstate Financial had
reinsurance recoverables of $165 million and $170 million, respectively, due from subsidiaries of Citigroup (Triton Insurance and American Health and Life Insurance) and Scottish Re
(U.S.) Inc. in connection with the disposition of substantially all of the direct response distribution business in 2003. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the gross life insurance in force was $528.78 billion of which $222.38 billion was ceded to the unaffiliated reinsurers.

adoption of new other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance on April 1, 2009 resulted in an
adjustment to DAC to reverse previously recorded DAC accretion related to realized capital losses that were reclassified to other comprehensive income upon adoption.  (2)The
adoption of new other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance resulted in an adjustment to DAC due to the
change in unrealized capital gains and losses that occurred upon adoption on April 1, 2009 when previously recorded realized capital losses were reclassified to other comprehensive income. The
adjustment was recorded as an increase of the DAC balance and unrealized capital gains and losses.

       On January 11, 2012, the Company issued $500 million of 5.20% Senior Notes due 2042. The proceeds of this issuance will be used for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $350 million of 6.125% Senior Notes maturing on February 15, 2012. 
       The
Company has outstanding $500 million of Series A 6.50% and $500 million of Series B 6.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior
Subordinated Debentures (together the "Debentures"). The scheduled maturity dates for the Debentures are May 15, 2057 and May 15, 2037 for Series A and Series B,
respectively, with a final maturity date of May 15, 2067. The Debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2037 or May 15, 2017 for
Series A and Series B, respectively, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part,
prior to May 15, 2037 and May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B, respectively, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if
greater, a make-whole price. 
       Interest
on the Debentures is payable semi-annually at the stated fixed annual rate to May 15, 2037 and May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B,
respectively, and then payable quarterly at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.12% and 1.935% for Series A and Series B, respectively. The Company may elect at one or
more times to defer payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods that do not exceed 10 years. Interest compounds during such deferral periods at the rate
in effect for each period. The interest deferral feature obligates the Company in certain circumstances to issue common stock or certain other types of securities if it cannot otherwise raise
sufficient funds to make the required interest payments. The Company has reserved 75 million shares of its authorized and unissued common stock to satisfy this obligation. 
       In
connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into replacement capital covenants. These covenants are not intended for the benefit of the holders of the
Debentures and may not be enforced by them. Rather, they are for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the 6.90% Senior Debentures due
2038. Pursuant to these covenants, the Company has agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the Debentures on or before May 15, 2067 and May 15, 2047 for Series A and
Series B, respectively, unless, subject to certain limitations, the Company has received proceeds in specified amounts from the issuance of specified securities. These covenants terminate in
2067 and 2047 for Series A and Series B, respectively, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the Debentures of the particular series due to the
occurrence of an event of default. An event of default, as defined by the supplemental indentures, includes default in the payment of interest or principal and bankruptcy proceedings. 
       The
Company is the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE used to acquire up to 19 automotive collision repair stores ("synthetic lease"). In 2011, the Company renewed the synthetic
lease for a three-year term at a floating rate due 2014. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include $32 million and $33 million of property and
equipment, net and $44 million and $42 million of long-term debt as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
       The
Allstate Bank received a $10 million long-term advance from the FHLB in April 2008, and another $10 million advance in September 2008. The FHLB advances are
secured with cash pledged to the FHLB. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, $2 million, $2 million and $1 million was repaid on the advances, respectively. The Allstate Corporation will be
assuming these obligations when the Bank is dissolved. 
       To
manage short-term liquidity, the Company maintains a commercial paper program and a credit facility as a potential source of funds. These include a $1.00 billion
unsecured revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion. The credit facility has an initial term of five years expiring in May 2012. The
Company has the option to extend the expiration by one year upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two-thirds of the commitments to lend. This facility also
contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new
lenders. This facility has a financial covenant requiring the Company not to exceed a 37.5% 
167



 
Table of Contents
debt
to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreement. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and
borrowing under it are based
on the ratings of the Company's senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long-term debt. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and
the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company
had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
       The
Company paid $363 million, $363 million and $383 million of interest on debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
       During
2009, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that expires in 2012. The registration statement covers an
unspecified amount of securities and can be used to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of
trust subsidiaries. 
 Capital stock  
       The Company had 900 million shares of issued common stock of which 501 million shares were outstanding and
399 million shares were held in treasury as of December 31, 2011. In 2011, the Company reacquired 33 million shares at an average cost of $28.65 and reissued 1 million
shares under equity incentive plans. 
13.  Company Restructuring  
       The Company undertakes various programs to reduce expenses. These programs generally involve a reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office
closures. Restructuring and related charges include employee termination and relocation benefits, and post-exit rent expenses in connection with these programs, and non-cash
charges resulting from pension benefit payments made to agents in connection with the 1999 reorganization of Allstate's multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program. In 2011,
restructuring programs primarily relate to Allstate Protection's field claim office consolidations, reorganization of technology shared services and reorganization within Allstate Financial's sales
and support organization. The expenses related to these activities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as restructuring and related charges, and totaled $44 million,
$30 million and $130 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

       The payments applied against the liability for employee costs primarily reflect severance costs, and the payments for exit costs generally consist
of post-exit rent expenses and contract termination penalties. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative amount incurred to date for active programs totaled $110 million for
employee costs and $47 million for exit costs. 
14.  Commitments, Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities  
 Leases  
       The Company leases certain office facilities and computer equipment. Total rent expense for all leases was $256 million,
$256 million and $267 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

 Shared markets and state facility assessments  
       The Company is required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations in various
states that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which
tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the Company's results of operations. Because of the Company's participation, it may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities
and/or assessments from these facilities. 
       Castle
Key is subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida ("FL Citizens"), which was initially created by the state of Florida to provide
insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. FL Citizens, at the discretion and direction of its Board of Governors ("FL Citizens Board"), can levy a regular
assessment on assessable insurers and assessable insureds for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of 6% of the deficit or 6% of Florida property premiums
industry-wide for the prior year. Prior to July 2008, the assessment rate was 10%. The base of assessable insurers includes all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers'
compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the NFIP. An insurer may recoup a regular assessment through a surcharge to policyholders. In order to
recoup this assessment, an insurer must file for a policy surcharge with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation ("FL OIR") at least fifteen days prior to imposing the surcharge on policies. If a
deficit remains after the regular assessment, FL Citizens can also levy emergency assessments in the current and subsequent years. Companies are required to collect the emergency assessments directly
from residential property policyholders and remit to FL Citizens as collected. 
       FL
Citizens reported losses from Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which followed a deficit for the 2004 plan year. The FL Citizens Board certified the 2005 FL Citizens deficit at
$1.73 billion of which $920 million was to be funded through a regular assessment. The Company paid its portion of the deficit assessment totaling $14 million during 2006 and has
recouped $11 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company expects to continue recoupment in 2012. The remainder of the deficit was funded by bonds issued in 2006. 
       The
Company is also subject to assessments from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("LA Citizens"). LA Citizens can levy a regular assessment on participating companies
for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of 10% of the calendar year deficit or 10% of Louisiana direct property premiums industry-wide for the prior calendar
year. 
 Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund  
       Castle Key participates in the mandatory coverage provided by the FHCF and therefore has access to reimbursements on certain qualifying
Florida hurricane losses from the FHCF (see Note 10), has exposure to assessments and pays annual premiums to the FHCF for this reimbursement protection. The FHCF has the authority to issue
bonds to pay its obligations to insurers participating in the mandatory coverage in excess of its capital balances. Payment of these bonds is funded by emergency assessments on all property and
casualty premiums in the state, except workers' compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the NFIP. The FHCF emergency assessments are limited to 6%
of premiums per year beginning the first year in which reimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of 10% of premiums per year for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to
fund additional bonding. The FHCF issued $625 million in bonds in 2008, and the FL OIR ordered an emergency assessment of 1% of premiums collected for all policies renewed after
January 1, 2007. The FHCF issued 
169



 
Table of Contents
$676 million
in bonds in 2010 and the FL OIR ordered an emergency assessment of 1.3% of premiums collected for all policies written or renewed after January 1, 2011. As required,
companies will collect the FHCF emergency assessments directly from policyholders and remit them to the FHCF as they are collected. 
       Facilities
such as FL Citizens, LA Citizens and the FHCF are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders; however, the exposure to assessments from these
facilities and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases may not offset each other in the Company's financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not
offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not
being renewed in subsequent years. 
 California Earthquake Authority  
       Exposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company's participation in the California
Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for
earthquake damage. Insurers selling homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The
Company's homeowners policies continue to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA. 
       As
of September 30, 2011, the CEA's capital balance was approximately $3.96 billion. Should losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, additional funding
would be obtained from the proceeds of revenue bonds the CEA may issue, an existing $3.05 billion reinsurance layer, and finally, if needed, assessments on participating insurance companies.
The authority of the CEA to assess participating insurers extends through December 1, 2018. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed
$1.56 billion, if the capital of the CEA falls below $350 million. Participating insurers are required to pay a second additional assessment, currently estimated not to exceed
$804 million, if aggregate CEA earthquake losses exceed $9.69 billion and the capital of the CEA falls below $350 million. Within the limits previously described, the assessment
could be intended to restore the CEA's capital to a level of $350 million. There is no provision that allows insurers to recover assessments through a premium surcharge or other mechanism. The
CEA's projected aggregate claim paying capacity is $9.69 billion as of October 31, 2011 and if an event were to result in claims greater than its capacity, affected policyholders would
be paid a prorated portion of their covered losses. 
       All
future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December 31 of the preceding year. As of April 1, 2011, the
Company's share of the CEA was 16.2%. The Company does not expect its CEA market share to materially change. At this level, the Company's maximum possible CEA assessment would be $382 million
during 2012. Accordingly, assessments from the CEA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not the financial position of the Company.
Management believes the Company's exposure to earthquake losses in California has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA. 
 Texas Windstorm Insurance Association  
       The Company participates in the mandatory coverage provided by the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association ("TWIA"), for losses relating
to hurricane activity. Amounts assessed to each company are allocated based upon its proportion of business written. In September 2008, TWIA assessed the Company $66 million for losses relating
to Hurricane Ike. The assessment was based on 2007 direct voluntary writings in the State of Texas. The Company expects to recoup $35 million of the assessment via premium tax offsets over a
five year period. $7 million of the total recoupable amount was realized via premium tax offsets in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009. The remaining $31 million of the assessment was eligible
for cession under the Company's reinsurance program. The TWIA board has not indicated the likelihood of any possible future assessments to insurers at this time. However, assessments from the TWIA for
a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not the financial position of the Company. Management believes the Company's exposure to losses
in Texas has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the TWIA. 
 Guaranty funds  
       Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain
obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Amounts assessed to each company are typically related to its proportion of business written in each state. The Company's
policy is to accrue 
170



 
Table of Contents
assessments
when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium
upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. In certain states there must also
be a final order of liquidation. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the liability balance included in other liabilities and accrued expenses was $53 million and $46 million,
respectively. The related premium tax offsets included in other assets were $35 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 PMI runoff support agreement  
       The Company has certain limited rights and obligations under a capital support agreement ("Runoff Support Agreement") with PMI Mortgage
Insurance Company ("PMI"), the primary operating subsidiary of PMI Group, related to the Company's disposition of PMI in prior years. Under the Runoff Support
Agreement, the Company would be required to pay claims on PMI policies written prior to October 28, 1994 if PMI fails certain financial covenants and fails to pay such claims. The agreement
only covers these policies and not any policies issued on or after that date. In the event any amounts are so paid, the Company would receive a commensurate amount of preferred stock or subordinated
debt of PMI Group or PMI. The Runoff Support Agreement also restricts PMI's ability to write new business and pay dividends under certain circumstances. On October 20, 2011, the Director of the
Arizona Department of Insurance took control of the PMI insurance companies; effective October 24, 2011, the Director instituted a partial claim payment plan: claim payments will be made at
50%, with the remaining amount deferred as a policyholder claim. The effect of these developments to the Company are uncertain. Management does not believe they will have a material effect on results
of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company. 
 Guarantees  
       The Company owns certain fixed income securities that obligate the Company to exchange credit risk or to forfeit principal due,
depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit events for the reference entities. In the event all such specified credit events were to occur, the Company's maximum amount at risk on these
fixed income securities, as measured by the amount of the aggregate initial investment, was $28 million as of December 31, 2011. The obligations associated with these fixed income
securities expire at various dates on or before March 11, 2018. 
       Related
to the disposal through reinsurance of substantially all of Allstate Financial's variable annuity business to Prudential in 2006, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries,
ALIC and ALNY, have agreed to indemnify Prudential for certain pre-closing contingent liabilities (including extra-contractual liabilities of ALIC and ALNY and liabilities specifically
excluded from the transaction) that ALIC and ALNY have agreed to retain. In addition, the Company, ALIC and ALNY will each indemnify Prudential for certain post-closing liabilities that
may arise from the acts of ALIC, ALNY and their agents, including in connection with ALIC's and ALNY's provision of transition services. The reinsurance agreements contain no limitations or
indemnifications with regard to insurance risk transfer, and transferred all of the future risks and responsibilities for performance on the underlying variable annuity contracts to Prudential,
including those related to benefit guarantees. Management does not believe this agreement will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company. 
       The
Company provides residual value guarantees on Company leased automobiles. If all outstanding leases were terminated effective December 31, 2011, the Company's maximum
obligation pursuant to these guarantees, assuming the automobiles have no residual value, would be $6 million as of December 31, 2011. The remaining term of each residual value guarantee
is equal to the term of the underlying lease that ranges from less than one year to three years. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these guarantees. 
       In
the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to contractual counterparties in connection with numerous transactions, including acquisitions and
divestitures. The types of indemnifications typically provided include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third party
lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. The terms
of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and
are not expected to occur. Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to
these obligations. 
       The
aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2011.

Table of Contents 
 Regulation and Compliance  
       The Company is subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. From time to time, regulatory authorities or legislative
bodies seek to influence and restrict premium rates, require premium refunds to policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated policies, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel or
non-renew policies, require insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their ability to write new policies, limit insurers' ability to change coverage terms or to impose
underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agent and broker compensation, regulate the nature of and amount of investments, and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance
products and the insurance industry. The Company has established procedures and policies to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, to foster prudent business operations, and to support
financial reporting. The Company routinely reviews its practices to validate compliance with laws and regulations and with internal procedures and policies. As a result of these reviews, from time to
time the Company may decide to modify some of its procedures and policies. Such modifications, and the reviews that led to them, may be accompanied by payments being made and costs being
incurred. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these actions on the Company's business, if any, are uncertain. 
 Legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries  
       The Company and certain subsidiaries are involved in a number of lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising
out of various aspects of its business. 
 Background  
       These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities,
including the underlying facts of each matter; novel legal issues; variations between jurisdictions in which matters are being litigated, heard, or investigated; differences in applicable laws and
judicial interpretations; the length of time before many of these matters might be resolved by settlement, through litigation, or otherwise; the fact that some of the lawsuits are putative class
actions in which a class has not been certified and in which the purported class may not be clearly defined; the fact that some of the lawsuits involve multi-state class actions in which the
applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute and therefore unclear; and the current challenging legal environment faced by large corporations and insurance companies. 
       The
outcome of these matters may be affected by decisions, verdicts, and settlements, and the timing of such decisions, verdicts, and settlements, in other individual and class action
lawsuits that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities and by other legal, governmental, and regulatory actions that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities. The outcome
may also be affected by future state or federal legislation, the timing or substance of which cannot be predicted. 
       In
the lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies which may include equitable relief in the form of injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in the form of contractual and
extra-contractual damages. In some cases, the monetary damages sought may include punitive or treble damages. Often specific information about the relief sought, such as the amount of damages, is not
available because plaintiffs have not requested specific relief in their pleadings. When specific monetary demands are made, they are often set just below a state court jurisdictional limit in order
to seek the maximum amount available in state court, regardless of the specifics of the case, while still avoiding the risk of removal to federal court. In Allstate's experience, monetary demands in
pleadings bear little relation to the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company. 
       In
connection with regulatory examinations and proceedings, government authorities may seek various forms of relief, including penalties, restitution, and changes in business practices.
The Company may not be advised of the nature and extent of relief sought until the final stages of the examination or proceeding. 
 Accrual and disclosure policy  
       The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate
accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management's best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not establish accruals for such matters when the Company does not believe both that it is probable that
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company's assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the
ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. 
172



 
Table of Contents
       The
Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings for further developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and
estimable, and accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount of accruals that have been previously established. There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of any amount accrued.
Disclosure of the nature and amount of an accrual is made when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company's ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by
the disclosure of the amount of accrual. 
       When
the Company assesses it is reasonably possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it discloses the matter. When it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Disclosure is not required when an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss cannot be made. 
       For
certain of the matters described below in the "Claims related proceedings" and "Other proceedings" subsections, the Company is able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range
of loss above the amount accrued, if any. In determining whether it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, the Company reviews and evaluates the disclosed matters, in
conjunction with counsel, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. 
       These
developments may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, information obtained from other sources,
experience from managing these and other matters, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. When the Company possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of the
reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or
reasonably possible but such an estimate is not possible. Disclosure of the estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for any individual matter would
only be considered when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company's ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the individual
estimate. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the Company estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, for the disclosed matters where such
an estimate is possible is zero to $855 million, pre-tax. This disclosure is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Under accounting guidance, an event is "reasonably possible"
if "the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely" and an event is "remote" if "the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight." This
estimate is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimate
will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimate does not include matters or losses for which an estimate is not possible. Therefore,
this estimate represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Company's maximum possible loss exposure. Information is provided below
regarding the nature of all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these loss contingencies. 
       Due
to the complexity and scope of the matters disclosed in the "Claims related proceedings" and "Other proceedings" subsections below and the many uncertainties that exist, the ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and
may be material to the Company's operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to it, management believes that the ultimate
outcome of all matters described below, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the Company. 
 Claims related proceedings  
       Allstate is vigorously defending a putative class action lawsuit filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and currently pending in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ("District Court"). This matter was filed by the Louisiana Attorney General against Allstate and every other homeowner insurer
doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana, as assignee, and on behalf of a class of Road Home fund recipients. In this matter the State alleged that the insurers
failed to pay all damages owed under their policies. The claims currently pending in this matter are for breach of contract and for declaratory relief on the alleged underpayment of claims by the
insurers. All other claims, including extra-contractual claims, have been dismissed. The Company had moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the State had no standing to bring the lawsuit
as an assignee of insureds because of anti-assignment language in the underlying insurance policies. Now, however, due to a ruling by the 
173



 
Table of Contents
Louisiana
Supreme Court, the Company will not pursue a motion to dismiss, but will preserve the anti-assignment issue in a defense. 
       The
State has not yet identified the specific details by property supporting its allegations of breach of contract or the alleged deficiencies in adjusting those claims. There are many
potential individual claims at issue in this matter, each of which will require individual analysis and a number of which may be subject to individual defenses, including release, accord and
satisfaction, prescription, waiver, and estoppel. There has been no
discovery in connection with this matter. The Company has now filed a motion seeking to force the State to provide more specificity as to its claims in this matter. The Company believes that its
adjusting practices in connection with Katrina homeowners claims were sound and in accordance with industry standards and state law. There remain significant questions of Louisiana law that have yet
to be decided. In the Company's judgment, given the issues discussed above, a loss is not probable. 
       Allstate
has been vigorously defending a lawsuit in regards to certain claims employees involving worker classification issues. This lawsuit is a certified class action challenging a
state wage and hour law. In this case, plaintiffs sought actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, liquidated damages in an amount equal to an unspecified percentage of the aggregate
underpayment of wages to be proven at trial, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. Plaintiffs have not made a settlement demand nor have they alleged the amount of damages with any specificity. The
case was bifurcated between liability and damages and is currently focused only on liability issues. No discovery has taken place regarding plaintiffs' alleged damages. In December 2009, the liability
phase of the case was tried, and, on July 6, 2010, the court issued its decision finding in favor of Allstate on all claims. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision in favor of Allstate to
the first level appellate court. After concluding the current appeal, the parties may seek a subsequent appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. Only liability issues are being addressed on appeal and no
damages may be awarded at this stage of the proceedings. In the event the trial court's order were to be overturned, however, the parties would need to conduct damages discovery, and a trial on
damages would have to take place, before any damages could be awarded. In the Company's judgment a loss is not probable. 
       Allstate
is vigorously defending a class action lawsuit in Montana state court challenging aspects of its claim handling practices in Montana. The plaintiff alleges that the Company
adjusts claims made by individuals who do not have attorneys in a manner that unfairly resulted in lower payments compared to claimants who were represented by attorneys. In January 2012, the court
certified a class of Montana claimants who were not represented by attorneys with respect to the resolution of auto accident claims. The court certified the class to cover an indefinite period that
commences in the mid-1990's. The certified claims include claims for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and punitive damages in an unspecified amount. Injunctive relief may include a
claim process by which unrepresented claimants could request that their claims be readjusted. No compensatory damages are sought on behalf of the class. To date no discovery has occurred related to
the potential value of the class members' claims. The Company has asserted various defenses with respect to the plaintiff's claims which have not been finally resolved. The proposed injunctive relief
claim process would be subject to defenses and offsets ordinarily associated with the adjustment of claims. Any differences in amounts paid to class members compared to what class members might be
paid under a different process would be speculative and subject to individual variation and determination dependent upon the individual circumstances presented by each class claimant. In the Company's
judgment a loss is not probable. 
 Other proceedings  
       The Company is defending certain matters relating to the Company's agency program reorganization announced in 1999. Although these
cases have been pending for many years, they currently are in the early stages of litigation because of appellate court proceedings and threshold procedural issues. 


These matters include a lawsuit filed in 2001 by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging
retaliation under federal civil rights laws ("EEOC I") and a class action filed in 2001 by former employee agents alleging retaliation and age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act ("ADEA"), breach of contract and ERISA violations ("Romero I"). In 2004, in the consolidated EEOC I and Romero I litigation, the trial court issued a memorandum and order that, among other things,
certified classes of agents, including a mandatory class of agents who had signed a release, for purposes of effecting the court's declaratory judgment that the release was voidable at the option of
the release signer. The court also ordered that an agent who voided the release must return to Allstate "any and all benefits received by the [agent] in exchange for signing
the release." The court also stated that, "on the undisputed facts of record, there is no basis for claims of age discrimination." The EEOC and plaintiffs asked the court to clarify and/or reconsider
its memorandum and order and in January 2007, the judge denied their request. In June 2007, the court reversed its prior ruling that the release was voidable and granted the Company's motions for
summary judgment, ruling that the asserted claims were barred by the release signed by most plaintiffs.

Table of Contents


Plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ("Third Circuit"). In July 2009, the Third Circuit vacated the trial court's entry of summary judgment in the
Company's favor and remanded the cases to the trial court for additional discovery, including additional discovery related to the validity of the release and waiver. In its opinion, the Third Circuit
held that if the release and waiver is held to be valid, then all of the claims in Romero I and EEOC I are barred. Thus, if the waiver and release is upheld, then only the claims in Romero I asserted
by the small group of employee agents who did not sign the release and waiver would remain for adjudication. In January 2010, following the remand, the cases were assigned to a new judge for further
proceedings in the trial court. Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint on July 28, 2010. Plaintiffs seek broad but unspecified "make whole relief," including back pay, compensatory and
punitive damages, liquidated damages, lost investment capital, attorneys' fees and costs, and equitable relief, including reinstatement to employee agent status with all attendant benefits for up to
approximately 6,500 former employee agents. Despite the length of time that these matters have been pending, to date only limited discovery has occurred related to the damages claimed by individual
plaintiffs, and no damages discovery has occurred related to the claims of the putative class. Nor have plaintiffs provided any calculations of the putative class's alleged back pay or the alleged
liquidated, compensatory or punitive damages, instead asserting that such calculations will be provided at a later stage during expert discovery. Damage claims are subject to reduction by amounts and
benefits received by plaintiffs and putative class members subsequent to their employment termination. Little to no discovery has occurred with respect to amounts earned or received by plaintiffs and
putative class members in mitigation of their alleged losses. Alleged damage amounts and lost benefits of the approximately 6,500 putative class members also are subject to individual variation and
determination dependent upon retirement dates, participation in employee benefit programs, and years of service. Discovery limited to the validity of the waiver and release is in process. At present,
no class is certified. Summary judgment proceedings on the validity of the waiver and release are expected to occur in the first half of 2012. 


A putative nationwide class action has also been filed by former employee agents alleging various violations of ERISA,
including a worker classification issue ("Romero II"). These plaintiffs are challenging certain amendments to the Agents Pension Plan and are seeking to have exclusive agent independent contractors
treated as employees for benefit purposes. Romero II was dismissed with prejudice by the trial court, was the subject of further proceedings on appeal, and was reversed and remanded to the trial court
in 2005. In June 2007, the court granted the Company's motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2009, the Third Circuit vacated the district
court's dismissal of the case and remanded the case to the trial court for additional discovery, and directed that the case be reassigned to another trial court judge. In its opinion, the Third
Circuit held that if the release and waiver is held to be valid, then one of plaintiffs' three claims asserted in Romero II is barred. The Third Circuit directed the district court to consider on
remand whether the other two claims asserted in Romero II are barred by the release and waiver. In January 2010, following the remand, the case was assigned to a new judge (the same judge for the
Romero I and EEOC I cases) for further proceedings in the trial court. On April 23, 2010, plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs seek broad but unspecified "make whole" or
other equitable relief, including losses of income and benefits as a result of their decision to retire from the Company between November 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000. They also seek
repeal of the challenged amendments to the Agents Pension Plan with all attendant benefits revised and recalculated for thousands of former employee agents, and attorney's fees and costs. Despite the
length of time that this matter has been pending, to date only limited discovery has occurred related to the damages claimed by individual plaintiffs, and no damages discovery has occurred related to
the claims of the putative class. Nor have plaintiffs provided any calculations of the putative class's alleged losses, instead asserting that such calculations will be provided at a later stage
during expert discovery. Damage claims are subject to reduction by amounts and benefits received by plaintiffs and putative class members subsequent to their employment termination. Little to no
discovery has occurred with respect to amounts earned or received by plaintiffs and putative class members in mitigation of their alleged losses. Alleged damage amounts and lost benefits of the
putative class members also are subject to individual variation and determination dependent upon retirement dates, participation in employee benefit programs, and years of service. As in Romero I and
EEOC I, discovery at this time is limited to issues relating to the validity of the waiver and release. Class certification has not been decided. Summary judgment proceedings on the validity of the
waiver and release are expected to occur in the first half of 2012. 

       In
these agency program reorganization matters, the threshold issue of the validity and scope of the waiver and release is yet to be decided and, if decided in favor of the Company,
would preclude any damages being awarded in Romero I and EEOC I and may also preclude damages from being awarded in Romero II. In the Company's judgment a

is not probable. Allstate has been vigorously defending these lawsuits and other matters related to its agency program reorganization. 
 Asbestos and environmental  
       Allstate's reserves for asbestos claims were $1.08 billion and $1.10 billion, net of reinsurance recoverables of
$529 million and $555 million, as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Reserves for environmental claims were $185 million and
$201 million, net of reinsurance recoverables
of $40 million and $47 million, as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Approximately 59% and 60% of the total net asbestos and environmental reserves
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were for incurred but not reported estimated losses.

believes its net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and
regulations. However, establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other
types of claims. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimate. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long
reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the
determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs' evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance;
retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos
producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are
covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and
sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to
defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Management
believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves.
In addition, while the Company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in its ability to estimate asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines net loss
reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable losses. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not
practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. 
15.  Income Taxes  
       The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated group
are allocated as generated by the respective entities. 
       The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining the Company's 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns. The IRS has completed its examinations of the Company's federal income
tax returns for 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 and the cases are under consideration at the IRS Appeals Office. The Company's tax years prior to 2005 have been examined by the IRS and
the statute of limitations has expired on those years. Any adjustments that may result from IRS examinations of tax returns are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations,
cash flows or financial position of the Company.

       The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will be reduced by $25 million within the next twelve months upon
the resolution of an outstanding issue resulting from the 2005-2006 IRS examination. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits
is not expected to impact the Company's effective tax rate. 
       The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company did not record interest income or expense relating to unrecognized tax
benefits in income tax expense in 2011 or 2010. The Company recorded $0.1 million of interest income relating to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in 2009. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was no interest accrued with respect to unrecognized tax benefits. No amounts have been accrued for penalties.

       Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will
be realized based on the Company's assessment that the deductions ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be fully utilized. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by
$61 million in 2011 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Answer Financial. The valuation allowance relates to the portion of Answer

Financial's
net operating loss carryforwards that, due to limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code, are expected to expire prior to their utilization. 
       As
of December 31, 2011, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $580 million which will expire at the end of 2015 through 2031. The Company has tax credit
carryforwards of $9 million which will be available to offset future tax liabilities and expire at the end of 2029 through 2031. In addition, the Company has an alternative minimum tax credit
carryforward of $255 million which will be available to offset future tax liabilities indefinitely.

       Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes expense of $254 million attributable to an increase in the
valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of 2009. This valuation allowance was released in connection with the adoption of new
other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance on April 1, 2009; however, the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse
the amount recorded in income tax expense. The release of the valuation allowance is related to the reversal of previously recorded other-than-temporary impairment write-downs
that would not have been recorded under the new other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance. 
       The
Company paid income taxes of $32 million in 2011 and received refunds of $8 million and $1.25 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company had a current
income tax receivable of $157 million and $129 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

16.  Statutory Financial Information  
       Allstate's domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws,
regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed. 
       All
states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, subject to any
deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner and/or director. Statutory accounting practices differ from GAAP primarily since they require charging policy acquisition
and certain sales inducement costs to expense as incurred, establishing life insurance reserves based on different actuarial assumptions, and valuing certain investments and establishing deferred
taxes on a different basis.

(1)The
Property-Liability statutory capital and surplus balances exclude wholly-owned subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment. 

       There were no permitted practices utilized as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. 
 Dividends  
       The ability of the Company to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of
dividends from AIC and other relevant factors. The payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the state insurance regulator is limited to formula amounts based on net income
and capital and surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. AIC paid dividends of
$838 million in 2011, which was less than the maximum amount allowed under Illinois insurance law without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance ("IL DOI") based on 2010
formula amounts. The maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2012 is $1.51 billion, less dividends paid during the
preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. 
       Notification
and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the IL DOI for transactions that exceed a level that is based on a formula using statutory admitted
assets and statutory surplus. 
17.  Benefit Plans  
 Pension and other postretirement plans  
       Defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents.
Benefits under the pension plans are based upon the employee's length of service and eligible annual compensation. A cash balance formula was added to the Allstate Retirement Plan effective
January 1, 2003. All eligible employees hired before August 1, 2002 were provided with a one-time opportunity to choose between the cash balance formula and the final average
pay formula. The cash balance formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August 1, 2002. 
       The
Company also provides certain health care subsidies for eligible employees hired before January 1, 2003 when they retire and their eligible dependents and certain life
insurance benefits for eligible employees hired before
January 1, 2003 when they retire ("postretirement benefits"). Qualified employees may become eligible for these benefits if they retire in accordance with the Company's established retirement
policy and are continuously insured under the Company's group plans or other approved plans in accordance with the plan's participation requirements. The Company shares the cost of retiree medical
benefits with non Medicare-eligible retirees based on years of service, with the Company's share being subject to a 5% limit on annual medical cost inflation after retirement. During 2009, the Company
decided to change its approach for delivering benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees. The Company no longer offers medical benefits for Medicare-eligible retirees but instead provides a fixed Company
contribution (based on years of service and other factors), which is not subject to adjustments for inflation. 
       The
Company has reserved the right to modify or terminate its benefit plans at any time and for any reason. 
 Obligations and funded status  
       The Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation
("PBO") for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") for other postretirement plans. The determination of pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010 are determined using a December 31 measurement date. The benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee
service rendered as of the measurement date. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plan's funded status is calculated as the
difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company's funding 
179

policy
for the pension plans is to make annual contributions at a level that is in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") and generally accepted actuarial principles. The
Company's postretirement benefit plans are not funded.

       The increase of $235 million in the pension net actuarial loss during 2011 is related to a decrease in the discount rate combined with
lower than expected returns. The majority of the $2.55 billion net actuarial pension benefit losses not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in 2011 reflects decreases in
the discount rate and the effect of unfavorable equity market conditions on the value of the pension plan assets in prior years. The decrease of $111 million in the OPEB net actuarial gain
during 2011 is primarily related to a decrease in the discount rate, higher than expected claim costs of future retirees and amortization of net actuarial gains. The decrease of $23 million in
the OPEB prior service credit is related to amortization of prior service cost.

change in 2011 in items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic cost, which is recorded in unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost, is shown in the table

       The accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") for all defined benefit pension plans was $5.16 billion and $4.82 billion as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The ABO is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered at the measurement date.
However, it differs from the PBO due to the exclusion of an assumption as to future compensation levels. 
       The
PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets for the Company's pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets were $5.51 billion, $4.85 billion and $4.33 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and $4.48 billion, $3.79 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. Included in the accrued benefit cost
of the pension benefits are certain unfunded non-qualified plans with accrued benefit costs of $142 million and $132 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

       The weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit cost is 7.30% for 2012, gradually
declining to 4.5% in 2024 and remaining at that level thereafter. 
       Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care plans. A one percentage-point increase in assumed health care
cost trend rates would increase the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the APBO by $3 million and
$27 million, respectively. A one percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit
cost of other postretirement benefits and the APBO by $2 million and $21 million, respectively.

       In general, the Company's pension plan assets are managed in accordance with investment policies approved by pension investment committees. The
purpose of the policies is to ensure the plans' long-term ability to meet benefit obligations by prudently investing plan assets and Company contributions, while taking into consideration
regulatory and legal requirements and current market conditions. The investment policies are reviewed periodically and specify target plan asset allocation by asset category. In addition, the policies
specify various asset allocation and other risk limits. The pension plans' asset exposure within each asset category is tracked against widely accepted established benchmarks for each asset class with
limits on variation from the benchmark established in the investment policy. Pension plan assets are regularly monitored for compliance with these limits and other risk limits specified in the
investment policies. 
       The
pension plans' target asset allocation and the actual percentage of plan assets, by asset category as of December 31 are as follows:

exposure to an asset category. The notional amount of derivatives used for replication net of the notional amount of hedges is limited to 115% of total plan assets. Calculating the actual
allocation consistent with the target allocation results in actual allocations falling within the target allocation. 
       Outside
the target asset allocation, the pension plans participate in a securities lending program to enhance returns. U.S. government fixed income securities and U.S. equity securities
are lent out and cash collateral is invested 33% in fixed income securities and 67% in short-term investments.

(1)Real
estate funds held by the pension plans are primarily invested in U.S. commercial real estate.  (2)Private
equity funds held by the pension plans are primarily comprised of North American buyout funds.  (3)Hedge
funds held by the pension plans primarily comprise fund of funds investments in diversified pools of capital across funds with
underlying strategies such as convertible arbitrage, equity market neutral, fixed income arbitrage, global macro, commodity trading advisors, long short equity, short biased equity, and event driven. (4)
The
securities lending obligation represents the plan's obligation to return securities lending collateral received under a securities lending
program. The terms of the program allow both the plan and the counterparty the right and ability to redeem/return the securities loaned on short notice. Due to its relatively short-term
nature, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.  (5)Other
net plan assets represent interest and dividends receivable and net receivables related to settlements of investment transactions, such
as purchases and sales.

       The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. The Company's
assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually giving consideration to appropriate financial data including, but not limited to, the plan asset
allocation, forward-looking expected returns for the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. Given the long-term forward
looking nature of this assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not immediately result in a change. In giving consideration to the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company evaluated
returns using the same sources it has used historically which include: historical average asset class returns from an independent nationally recognized vendor of this type of data blended together
using the asset allocation policy weights for the Company's pension plans; asset class return forecasts from a large global independent asset management firm that specializes in providing multi-asset
class investment fund products which were blended together using the asset allocation policy weights; and expected portfolio returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a widely recognized
external investment consulting firm that performs asset allocation and actuarial services for corporate pension plan sponsors. This same methodology has been applied on a consistent basis each year.
All of these were consistent with the Company's long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.5% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. As of the 2011 measurement date, the
arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 10 and 5 years was 6.6% and 4.6%, respectively. 
       Pension
plan assets did not include any of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.

       Employees of the Company, with the exception of those employed by the Company's international, Sterling Collision Centers ("Sterling"),
Esurance and Answer Financial subsidiaries, are eligible to become members of the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan ("Allstate Plan"). The Company's contributions are based on the Company's matching
obligation and certain performance measures. The Company is responsible for funding its anticipated contribution to the Allstate Plan, and may, at the discretion of management, use the ESOP to
pre-fund certain portions. In connection with the Allstate Plan, the Company has a note from the ESOP with a principal balance of $22 million as of December 31, 2011. The
ESOP note has a fixed interest rate of 7.9% and matures in 2019. The Company records dividends on the ESOP shares in retained income and all the shares held by the ESOP are included in basic and
diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 
       The
Company's contribution to the Allstate Plan was $48 million, $36 million, and $78 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts were reduced by the
ESOP benefit computed for the years ended December 31 as follows:

       The Company made no contributions to the ESOP in 2011, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2011, total committed to be released, allocated
and unallocated ESOP shares were 0.2 million, 34 million and 5 million, respectively. 
       Allstate
has defined contribution plans for eligible employees of its Canadian, Sterling, Esurance and Answer Financial subsidiaries. Expense for these plans was $7 million,
$5 million and $6 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

18.  Equity Incentive Plans  
       The Company currently has two equity incentive plans that permit it to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options and restricted stock units to
certain employees and directors of the Company. The total compensation expense related to equity awards was $64 million, $68 million and $74 million and the total income tax
benefits were $21 million, $23 million and $25 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total cash received from the exercise of options was $19 million,
$28 million and $3 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total tax benefit realized on options exercised and stock unrestricted was $10 million, $11 million and
$3 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
       The
Company records compensation expense related to awards under these plans over the vesting period of each grant. The Company records compensation expense for employees eligible for
continued vesting upon retirement over the vesting period to the date that the employee is eligible for retirement. As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation cost related to all
nonvested awards was $105 million, of which $56 million related to nonqualified stock options which are expected to be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of
2.36 years and $49 million related to restricted stock units which are expected to be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of 2.46 years. 
       Options
are granted under the plans with exercise prices equal to the closing share price of the Company's common stock on the applicable grant date. Options granted to employees
generally vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Options granted prior to 2010 vest ratably over a four year
period. Options may be exercised once vested and will expire ten years after the date of grant. For a normal retirement (age 60 with one year of service), all options granted more than
12 months before retirement, and a pro-rata portion of options granted within 12 months of retirement, continue to vest as scheduled. For an early retirement (age 55 with ten
years of service), a pro-rata portion of all options continue to vest as scheduled. When the options become vested, they may be exercised on or before the earlier of the option expiration
date or the fifth anniversary of the employee's retirement. If termination of employment is a result of death or disability, then all options vest and may be exercised on or before the earlier of the
option expiration date or the second anniversary of the date of termination of employment. Vested options may be exercised within three months following any other type of termination of employment
except termination after a change in control. Restricted stock units generally vest and unrestrict 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries
of the grant date, except for directors which vest immediately and unrestrict after leaving the board. Restricted stock units granted to employees prior to 2010 vest and unrestrict in full on the
fourth anniversary of the grant date. Employee awards are subject to forfeiture upon termination. For a normal retirement, all restricted stock units granted more than 12 months before
retirement, and a pro-rata portion of restricted stock units granted within 12 months of retirement, continue to unrestrict as provided for in the original grant. For an early
retirement, a pro-rata portion of all restricted stock units continue to vest as scheduled. Upon a termination of employment as a result of death or disability, all restricted stock units
vest. Unvested restricted stock units are forfeited following any other type of termination of employment except termination after a change in control. 
       A
total of 77.8 million shares of common stock were authorized to be used for awards under the plans, subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans' terms. As of
December 31, 2011, 19.2 million shares were reserved and remained available for future issuance under these plans. The Company uses its treasury shares for these issuances. 
       The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model. In addition, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of
options granted is derived from the output of the binominal lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility of the price of
the underlying shares is implied based on traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The expected dividends for 2011 were based on the current dividend yield of the
Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The expected dividends for 2010 were based on the current dividend yield of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The expected dividends for
2009 were based on a graded average of the current and historical long-term dividend yield of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the

       The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The market value in part
reflects the payment of future dividends expected. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted was $31.38, $31.32 and $17.47 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The total fair value of restricted stock units vested was $13 million, $16 million and $11 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
       The
tax benefit realized in 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to tax deductions from stock option exercises and included in shareholders' equity was $3 million, $4 million and
zero, respectively. The tax (expense) benefit realized in 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to all stock-based compensation and recorded directly to shareholders' equity was $(0.4) million,
$0.5 million and $(6) million, respectively.

19.  Reporting Segments  
       Allstate management is organized around products and services, and this structure is considered in the identification of its four reportable segments. These
segments and their respective operations are as follows: 
       Allstate Protection principally sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and Canada. Revenues from
external customers generated outside the United States were $892 million, $741 million and $619 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company evaluates the results of
this segment based upon underwriting results. 
       Discontinued Lines and Coverages consists of business no longer written by Allstate, including results from asbestos, environmental and
other discontinued lines claims, and certain commercial and other businesses in
run-off. This segment also includes the historical results of the commercial and reinsurance businesses sold in 1996. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon
underwriting results. 
       Allstate Financial sells life insurance, retirement and investment products and voluntary accident and health insurance. The principal
individual products are interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities including deferred and immediate; and voluntary accident and health insurance. The institutional
product line consists primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. Banking products
and services were previously offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. Allstate Financial had no revenues from external customers generated outside the United States in 2011, 2010 or 2009. The
Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon operating income. 
       Corporate and Other comprises holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. 
       Allstate
Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate Property-Liability investment income, realized capital gains and
losses, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial, and Corporate and Other levels for
decision-making purposes. 
       The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The effects of certain inter-segment transactions are excluded from segment
performance evaluation and therefore are eliminated in the segment results. 
 Measuring segment profit or loss  
       The measure of segment profit or loss used by Allstate's management in evaluating performance is underwriting income (loss) for the
Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and operating income for the Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments. A reconciliation of these measures to net income
(loss) is provided below. 
       Underwriting income (loss) is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expenses ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating
costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP. 
       Operating income (loss) is net income (loss) excluding:

realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on
non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income (loss), 
valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,  
amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses
or valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax, 
business combination expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets, after-tax,  
gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and 
adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of
the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Allstate Corporation
Northbrook, IL 60062 
We
have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related
Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying  Item 9A. Controls and
Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
In
2009, the Company changed its recognition and presentation for other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities.

        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities
Exchange Act and made known to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
        Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
       Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal
Control  Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. 
       Deloitte &
Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K,
has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. 
       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011, there have been no changes in
our
internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SCHEDULE II (CONTINUED)    CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION     
1.     General  
       The financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8.
The long-term debt presented in Note 12 "Capital Structure" are direct obligations of the Registrant, with the exception of the following obligations as of December 31: 
















($ in millions)
 
2011 
 
2010 
 


 Long-term:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, due 2018
 
$

$

 Synthetic lease VIE obligations, floating rates, due 2014

       A majority of the pension and other postretirement benefits plans presented in Note 17 "Benefit Plans" are direct obligations of the
Registrant. Effective November 30, 2011, the Registrant became the sponsor of a majority of the pension benefit plans presented in Note 17. Prior to November 30, 2011, a
subsidiary of the Registrant was the sponsor of these plans. 
2.    Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Investing Activity and Cash Flow Information  
       The Registrant's assumption of the obligations associated with the pension benefit plans previously sponsored by a subsidiary of the Registrant resulted in a
non-cash decrease in the Registrant's investment in subsidiaries of $713 million, after-tax in 2011. 
       The
Registrant paid $360 million, $360 million and $380 million of interest on debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Allstate Corporation
Northbrook, IL 60062 
We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2011, and the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, and have issued our report thereon dated February 22, 2012
(which report expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to a change in the Company's recognition and presentation for other-than-temporary
impairments of debt securities in 2009); such consolidated financial statements and report are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedules of the Company listed in the accompanying index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
