Item 1.
Business 
As used in this report, the terms we, us, our, GEO and the Company refer to
The GEO Group, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and its unconsolidated affiliates, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.  General  We are a leading provider of government-outsourced services
specializing in the management of correctional, detention, mental health, residential treatment and re-entry facilities, and the provision of community-based services and youth services in the United States, Australia, South Africa, the
United Kingdom and Canada. We operate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum, medium and minimum security prisons, immigration detention centers, minimum security detention centers, mental health, residential
treatment and community based re-entry facilities. We offer counseling, education and/or treatment to inmates with alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities we manage. We are also a provider of innovative compliance
technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants. Additionally, we have an exclusive contract with the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, which we refer to as ICE, to provide supervision and reporting services designed to improve the participation of non-detained aliens in the immigration court system. We develop new facilities based on contract awards, using our
project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency. We also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations
as contracted domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture, GEO Amey PECS Ltd., which we refer to as GEOAmey.  We acquired two companies, Cornell Companies, Inc. and BII Holding Corporation, during the past two years that have had, and we believe will continue to have, a significant impact on our business. As a
result of these acquisitions, we expect to benefit from the increased scale and diversification of service offerings. Our acquisition in August 2010 of Cornell Companies, Inc., which we refer to as Cornell and we refer to this transaction as the
Cornell Acquisition, added scale to our presence in the U.S. correctional and detention market, and combined Cornells adult community-based and youth treatment services into GEO Cares behavioral healthcare services platform to
create a leadership position in this growing market. Our acquisition on February 10, 2011 of BII Holding, the indirect owner of 100% of the equity interests of B.I. Incorporated, which we refer to as BI and refer to this transaction as the BI
Acquisition, provides us with the ability to offer turn-key solutions to our customers in managing the full lifecycle of an offender from arraignment to reintegration into the community, which we refer to as the corrections lifecycle. As of
January 1, 2012, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately 79,400 beds at 115 correctional, detention and residential treatment facilities, including idle facilities and projects under development, and
also included the provision of monitoring of approximately 70,000 offenders in a community-based environment on behalf of approximately 900 federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states. 
We provide a diversified scope of services on behalf of our government clients: 
 


 

 
 our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security, administrative, rehabilitation, education, health and food
services, primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities;   


 

 
 our mental health and residential treatment services involve working with governments to deliver quality care, innovative programming and active
patient treatment, primarily in state-owned mental healthcare facilities; 
  3 


Table of Contents


 

 
 our community-based services involve supervision of adult parolees and probationers and the provision of temporary housing, programming, employment
assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community;   


 

 
 our youth services include residential, detention and shelter care and community-based services along with rehabilitative, educational and treatment
programs;   


 

 
 our monitoring services provide our governmental clients with innovative compliance technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and
evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; including services provided under the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which we refer to as ISAP, to ICE for the provision
of services designed to improve the participation of non-detained aliens in the immigration court system.   


 

 
 we develop new facilities, using our project development experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities
that maximize security and efficiency; and   


 

 
 we provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically, and in the United Kingdom, our joint
venture GEOAmey is responsible for providing prisoner escort and custody services in the United Kingdom, including all of Wales and all of England except London and East of England. 
We maintained an average companywide facility occupancy rate of 94.6% for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, excluding
facilities that are either idle or under development.  Business Segments 
We conduct our business through four reportable business segments: our U.S. Corrections & Detention segment; our GEO Care
segment; our International Services segment and our Facility Construction & Design segment. We have identified these four reportable segments to reflect our current view that we operate four distinct business lines, each of which
constitutes a material part of our overall business. Our U.S. Corrections & Detention segment primarily encompasses our U.S.-based privatized corrections and detention business. Our GEO Care segment, which conducts its services in the U.S.,
consists of mental health, residential and non-residential treatment services, educational and community based programs, pre-release and halfway house programs, compliance technologies, monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and
treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants. Our International Services segment primarily consists of our privatized corrections and detention operations in South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom.
Our Facility Construction & Design segment primarily contracts with various states, local and federal agencies for the design and construction of facilities for which we generally have been, or expect to be, awarded management contracts.
Financial information about these segments for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 is contained in Note 18  Business Segments and Geographic Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by this reference.  Recent Developments 
Acquisition of BII Holding  On February 10, 2011, GEO completed its previously announced acquisition of BI, a Colorado corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 21, 2010, which we refer
to as the Merger Agreement, with BII Holding, a Delaware corporation, which owns BI, GEO Acquisition IV, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GEO, which we refer to as Merger Sub, BII Investors IF LP, in its capacity as the
stockholders representative, and AEA Investors 2006 Fund L.P. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BII Holding, which we refer to as the Merger, with BII Holding emerging as the surviving corporation of
the Merger. As a result of the Merger, GEO paid merger consideration of $409.6 million in cash excluding cash acquired, transaction related expenses and any potential adjustments. Under the Merger Agreement, $12.5 million of the merger
consideration was placed in an escrow account for a one-year period to satisfy any applicable indemnification claims pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement 
  4 


Table of Contents

by GEO, the Merger Sub or its affiliates. We expect to fully settle the indemnification claims prior to June 30, 2012. At the time of the BI Acquisition, approximately $78.4 million,
including accrued interest, was outstanding under BIs senior term loan and $107.5 million, including accrued interest was outstanding under its senior subordinated note purchase agreement, excluding the unamortized debt discount. All
indebtedness of BI under its senior term loan and senior subordinated note purchase agreement were repaid by BI with a portion of the $409.6 million of merger consideration. 
6.625% Senior Notes due 2021  On February 10, 2011, we completed the issuance of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021, which we refer to as the 6.625% Senior Notes, in a
private offering under an Indenture dated as of February 10, 2011 among us, certain of our domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The 6.625% Senior Notes were offered and sold to qualified
institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 6.625% Senior Notes were issued at a coupon rate and
yield to maturity of 6.625%. Interest on the 6.625% Senior Notes accrues at the rate of 6.625% per annum, is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, and commenced on August 15, 2011. The 6.625% Senior Notes
mature on February 15, 2021. We used the net proceeds from this offering along with $150.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Agreement dated as of August 4, 2010, which we refer to as our Senior Credit Facility, to finance the
acquisition of BI and to pay related fees, costs, and expenses. We used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. On August 22, 2011, we completed our exchange offer for the full $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our
6.625% Senior Notes Due 2021, and the guarantees thereof, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for a like amount of the outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes. The terms of the notes exchanged are identical to the notes
originally issued in the private offering, except that the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to a registration rights default will not apply to the registered notes exchanged. We did not receive
any proceeds from the exchange offer.  Amendment of Senior Credit Facility 
On February 8, 2011, we entered into Amendment No. 1, which we refer to as Amendment No. 1, to our Senior Credit Facility,
dated as of August 4, 2010, by and among us, the Guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and BNP Paribas, as administrative agent. Amendment No. 1, among other things amended certain definitions and covenants relating to the
total leverage ratios and the senior secured leverage ratios set forth in the Senior Credit Facility. This amendment increased our borrowing capacity by $250.0 million. On May 2, 2011, we executed Amendment No. 2 to our Senior Credit
Facility, which we refer to as Amendment No. 2. As a result of this amendment, relative to our Term Loan B, the Applicable Rate, as defined, was reduced to 2.75% per annum from 3.25% per annum in the case of Eurodollar loans and to
1.75% per annum from 2.25% per annum in the case of ABR loans and the LIBOR floor was reduced to 1.00% from 1.50%. As of January 1, 2012, the Senior Credit Facility was comprised of: a $150.0 million Term Loan A, due August 2015,
which we refer to as Term Loan A, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%; a $150.0 million Term Loan A-2, due August 2015, which we refer to as Term Loan A-2, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%; a $200.0 million Term Loan B, due
August 2016, which we refer to as Term Loan B, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%; and a $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, due August 2015, which we refer to as the Revolver, currently bearing interest
at LIBOR plus 3.00%. Incremental borrowings of $150.0 million under our amended Senior Credit Facility along with proceeds from our $300.0 million offering of the 6.625% Senior Notes were used to finance the acquisition of BI. 
As of February 27, 2012, the Company had $476.7 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding, net of discount, under the term loan
portion of our Senior Credit Facility, $312.0 million in borrowings under the Revolver, approximately $56.9 million in letters of credit and $131.1 million in additional borrowing capacity under the Revolver.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
On July 9, 2011, we adopted The GEO Group Inc. 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which we refer to as the Plan. The Plan was approved
by our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors on May 4, 2011. The purpose of the Plan, which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, as amended, is to encourage stock ownership through payroll
deductions by the employees of GEO and designated subsidiaries of GEO in order to increase their identification with our goals and secure a proprietary interest in our success. These deductions will be used to purchase shares of our Common Stock at
a 5% discount from the then current market price. The Plan is subject to approval by our shareholders on or before June 29, 2012 and, as such, no shares will be issued until such time as the Plan is approved by our shareholders. If the Plan is
approved by our shareholders, we will offer up to 500,000 shares of our common stock for sale to eligible employees. 
Stock Repurchase Program  On July 14, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $100.0 million of our common stock effective through December 31, 2012. The stock
repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow, and borrowings under our Revolver. The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements. The program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and/or vested stock
options. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any specific amount of our common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at our discretion. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, we purchased
3.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $75.0 million primarily purchased with proceeds from our Revolver. We believe we have the ability to continue to fund the stock repurchase program, our working capital, our debt service
requirements, and our maintenance and growth capital expenditure requirements, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for other corporate purposes.  Contract awards and facility activations  The following new projects

On June 1, 2011, we executed this contract with the City of Adelanto for the housing of federal immigration detainees at our existing 650-bed Detention Facility
and at a 650-bed facility expansion, which we are constructing, to be located on land immediately adjacent to the facility. We completed the renovation and retrofitting of the existing 650-bed facility and began the initial intake of 650 detainees
in August 2011. We expect to complete the new 650-bed expansion and begin the intake of the additional 650 detainees by August 2012.

In addition to the activations in the table above, we also announced other contract awards
during fiscal year 2011 as follows:  On March 16, 2011, we announced that our newly formed joint venture, GEOAmey, had
been awarded three contracts by the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom for the provision of prison escort and custody services in Lots 1, 3, and 4 which encompass all of Wales and all of England except London and the East of England. The
contract for the provision of prison escort and custody services in the three Lots will have a base term of seven years with a renewal option period of no more than three years. GEOAmey commenced operations on August 29, 2011. 
On September 19, 2011, we announced that we have signed a contract with ICE for the continued management of the company-owned Aurora
ICE Processing Center (the Center) located in Aurora, Colorado. The new contract will have a term of ten years, inclusive of renewal option periods. Under the terms of the new agreement, the contract capacity at the Center will be
increased from 432 to 525 beds, and the transportation responsibilities will be expanded.  On December 28, 2011, we
announced our execution of a contract with ICE for the continued management of our 1,904-bed South Texas Detention Center located in Pearsall, Texas. The new contract will have a term of approximately five years effective through November 30,
2016, inclusive of renewal option periods.  Contract terminations 
Contracts terminated during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 generated aggregate revenue of $48.8 million and a net operating
loss of $2.8 million, which includes $3.7 million of depreciation expense and also includes transition costs. The following contracts were terminated during fiscal year 2011:  Effective February 28, 2011, our contract for the management of the 424-bed North Texas ISF, located in Fort Worth, Texas, terminated. 
Effective April 30, 2011, our contract for the management of the 970-bed Regional Correctional Center, located in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, terminated.  Effective May 29, 2011, our subsidiary in the United Kingdom no longer managed the 215-bed
Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre in Kidlington, England.  On July 11, 2011, we announced that the State of
California decided to implement its Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, which is expected to delegate tens of thousands of low level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in California effective October 1, 2011. As a result of the
implementation of the Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, the State of California has decided to discontinue contracts with Community Correctional Facilities which currently house low level state offenders across the state. We received written notice
from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation regarding the cancellation of our agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of our facilities: (i) the company-leased 305-bed Leo Chesney Community
Correctional Facility which was terminated effective September 30, 2011; (ii) the company-owned 625-bed Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility which was terminated effective October 12, 2011; and (iii) the
company-owned 643-bed Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility which was terminated effective November 30, 2011. We are in the process of actively marketing these facilities to local county agencies in California. Given that most
local county jurisdictions in California are presently operating at or above their correctional capacity, we are hopeful that we will be able to market these facilities to local county agencies for the housing of low level offenders who will be the
responsibility of local county jurisdictions. Included in revenue for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 is $26.4 million of revenue related to these terminated contracts.

Table of Contents
On July 31, 2011, our contract for the management of the Brooklyn Community Re-entry
Center located in Brooklyn, New York terminated.  On September 2, 2011, we initiated discussions with the California
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, which we refer to as CDCR, to terminate our management agreement for the operation of the company-owned North Lake Correctional Facility. On September 26, 2011, CDCR notified us that our
contract would terminate effective October 2, 2011. Included in revenue for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 is $2.4 million of revenue related to this terminated contract. 
In an effort to consolidate existing Youth Services facilities and to maximize overall utilization, we terminated our contracts for the
management of Contact Interventions, located in Wauconda, Illinois and the Abraxas Center for Adolescent Females located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Additionally, our contract to manage Philadelphia Community-Based Programs located in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania terminated June 30, 2011 due to lack of funding.  On October 3, 2011, we exercised the termination
clause in our contract for the management of the Frio County Detention Center. Effective December 2, 2011, we no longer managed this facility.  Contracts terminated after January 1, 2012 generated aggregate revenue during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 of $14.4 million and a pre tax operating profit of $4.7 million, which
includes $0.8 million of depreciation expense. The following contracts terminated after January 1, 2012:  On or about
January 31, 2012, we were formally notified by the California Department of Corrections of their intention to exercise the right to terminate our contract for the management of the Golden State Medium Community Correctional Facility, which we
refer to as Golden State. Effective July 1, 2012, we will no longer manage this facility.  In February 2012, we were notified
that our contract for the management of the Migrant Operations Center in Guantanamo Bay NAS, Cuba would terminate effective March 31, 2012.  We are currently marketing approximately 7,700 vacant beds at nine of our idle facilities, including Golden State, to potential customers. The carrying values of these idle facilities totaled $297.3
million as of January 1, 2012, excluding equipment and other assets that can be easily transferred for use at other facilities. 
Quality of Operations 
We operate each facility in accordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the standards and guidelines required under
the relevant management contract. For many facilities, the standards and guidelines include those established by the American Correctional Association, or ACA. The ACA is an independent organization of corrections professionals, which establishes
correctional facility standards and guidelines that are generally acknowledged as a benchmark by governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities. Many of our contracts in the United States require us to seek and maintain ACA
accreditation of the facility. We have sought and received ACA accreditation and re-accreditation for all such facilities. We achieved a median re-accreditation score of 99.8% as of January 1, 2012. Approximately 75.9% of our 2011 U.S.
Corrections & Detention revenue was derived from ACA accredited facilities for the year ended January 1, 2012. In January 2012, we also received accreditation at our Blackwater River Correctional Facility and at Hudson Correctional
Facility. We have also achieved and maintained accreditation by The Joint Commission (TJC), at three of our correctional facilities, at nine of our youth services locations and at four of our residential treatment facilities. Our managed-only
720-bed Florida Civil Commitment Center in Arcadia, Florida obtained successful accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, or CARF, within 18 months of operation. We have been successful in achieving and
maintaining accreditation under the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, or NCCHC, in a majority of the facilities that we currently operate. The NCCHC accreditation is a voluntary process which we have used to establish comprehensive
health

care policies and procedures to meet and adhere to the ACA standards. The NCCHC standards, in most cases, exceed ACA Health Care Standards and we have achieved this accreditation at six of our
U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities and at two youth services locations. Additionally, BI has achieved a certification for ISO 9001:2008 for the design, production, installation and servicing of products and services produced by the
Electronic Monitoring business units, including electronic home arrest and domestic violence intervention monitoring services and products, installation services, and automated caseload management services. 
Business Development Overview  We intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new clients and contracts, expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities. Our primary potential
customers include: governmental agencies responsible for local, state and federal correctional facilities in the United States; governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; federal,
state and local government agencies in the United States responsible for mental health, residential treatment and community-based services for adult and juvenile offenders; federal, state and local government agencies responsible for monitoring
community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; and other foreign governmental agencies. We achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal, or RFP. We
primarily rely on the RFP process for organic growth in our U.S. and international corrections operations as well as in our mental health and residential treatment, youth services, community based re-entry services, and electronic monitoring
services business.  For our facility management contracts, our state and local experience has been that a period of
approximately sixty to ninety days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between one and four months elapse between the submission of our response and
the agencys award for a contract; and that between one and four months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable. 
For our facility management contracts, our federal experience has been that a period of approximately sixty to ninety days is generally
required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between twelve and eighteen months elapse between the submission of our response and the agencys award for a contract; and
that between four and eighteen weeks elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable.  If the state, local or federal facility for which an award has been made must be constructed, our experience is that construction usually takes between nine and twenty-four months to complete, depending
on the size and complexity of the project. Therefore, management of a newly constructed facility typically commences between ten and twenty-eight months after the governmental agencys award. 
For the services provided by BI, state, local and federal experience has been that a period of approximately thirty to ninety days is
generally required from the issuance of an RFP or Invitation to Bid, or ITB, to the submission of our response; that between one and three months elapse between the submission of our response and the agencys award for a contract; and that
between one and three months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of a program or the implementation of a program operations, as applicable. The term of our local, state and federal contracts range from one to five years and
some contracts include provisions for optional renewal years beyond the initial contract term. Contracts can, and are periodically, extended beyond the contract term and optional renewal years through alternative procurement processes including sole
source justification processes, cooperative procurement vehicles and agency decisions to add extension time periods.  We
believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective customers when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts. Our success in the RFP process has
resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential.

During 2011, we activated five new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of 3,533 additional beds compared to the activation of three new or expansion projects representing an aggregate
of 4,867 beds during 2010. Internationally, we activated three contracts for the provision of Prison Escort and Custody Services (PECS) during 2011 under a newly formed joint venture, GEOAmey. 
In addition to pursuing organic growth through the RFP process, we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and
construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer. We also plan to leverage our experience and scale of service offerings to expand the range of
government-outsourced services that we provide. We will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability. We have engaged and intend in
the future to engage independent consultants to assist us in developing privatization opportunities and in responding to requests for proposals, monitoring the legislative and business climate, and maintaining relationships with existing customers.
 Facility Design, Construction and Finance  We offer governmental agencies consultation and management services relating to the design and construction of new correctional and detention facilities and the redesign and renovation of older
facilities. Domestically, as of January 1, 2012, we had provided services for the design and construction of approximately forty-seven facilities and for the redesign and renovation and expansion of approximately thirty-three facilities.
Internationally, as of January 1, 2012, we had provided services for the design and construction of ten facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of one facility. 
Contracts to design and construct or to redesign and renovate facilities may be financed in a variety of ways. Governmental agencies may
finance the construction of such facilities through any of the following methods:   


 

 
 a one time general revenue appropriation by the governmental agency for the cost of the new facility; 
 


 

 
 general obligation bonds that are secured by either a limited or unlimited tax levy by the issuing governmental entity; or
  


 

 
 revenue bonds or certificates of participation secured by an annual lease payment that is subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations.
 We may also act as a source of financing or as a facilitator with respect to the financing of the
construction of a facility. In these cases, the construction of such facilities may be financed through various methods including the following:   


 

 
 funds from equity offerings of our stock;   


 

 
 cash on hand and/or cash flows from our operations;   


 

 
 borrowings by us from banks or other institutions (which may or may not be subject to government guarantees in the event of contract
termination); or   


 

 
 lease arrangements with third parties.  If the project is financed using direct governmental appropriations, with proceeds of the sale of bonds or other obligations issued prior to the award of the project, then financing is in place when the
contract relating to the construction or renovation project is executed. If the project is financed using project-specific tax-exempt bonds or other obligations, the construction contract is generally subject to the sale of such bonds or
obligations. Generally, substantial expenditures for construction will not be made on such a project until the tax-exempt bonds or other obligations are sold; and, if such bonds or obligations are not sold, construction and therefore, management of
the facility, may either be delayed until alternative financing is procured or the development of the project will be suspended or entirely cancelled. If the project is self-financed by us, then financing is generally in place prior to the
commencement of construction.

Table of Contents
Under our construction and design management contracts, we generally agree to be responsible
for overall project development and completion. We typically act as the primary developer on construction contracts for facilities and subcontract with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors. Where possible, we subcontract with
construction companies that we have worked with previously. We make use of an in-house staff of architects and operational experts from various correctional disciplines (e.g. security, medical service, food service, inmate programs and facility
maintenance) as part of the team that participates from conceptual design through final construction of the project. This staff coordinates all aspects of the development with subcontractors and provides site-specific services. 
When designing a facility, our architects use, with appropriate modifications, prototype designs we have used in developing prior
projects. We believe that the use of these designs allows us to reduce the potential of cost overruns and construction delays and to reduce the number of correctional officers required to provide security at a facility, thus controlling costs both
to construct and to manage the facility. Our facility designs also maintain security because they increase the area under direct surveillance by correctional officers and make use of additional electronic surveillance. 
The following table sets forth current expansion and development projects at various stages of completion:

Competitive Strengths 
Leading Corrections Provider Uniquely Positioned to Offer a Continuum of Care 
We are the second largest provider of privatized correctional and detention facilities worldwide, the largest provider of community-based
re-entry services and youth services in the U.S. and we are the largest provider of electronic monitoring services in the U.S. corrections industry. We believe these leading market positions and our diverse and complimentary service
offerings enable us to meet the growing demand from our clients for comprehensive services throughout the entire corrections lifecycle. Our continuum of care enables us to provide consistency and continuity in case management, which we believe
results in a higher quality of care for offenders, reduces recidivism, lowers overall costs for our clients, improves public safety and facilitates successful reintegration of offenders back into society. 
Large Scale Operator with National Presence  We operate the sixth largest correctional system in the U.S. by number of beds, including the federal government and all 50 states. We currently have operations in approximately 34 states and
offer electronic monitoring services in every state. In addition, we have extensive experience in overall facility operations, including staff recruitment, administration, facility maintenance, food service, healthcare, security, and in the
supervision, treatment and education of inmates. We believe our size and breadth of service offerings enable us to generate economies of scale which maximize our efficiencies and allows us to pass along cost savings to our clients. Our national
presence also positions us to bid on and develop new facilities across the U.S.

Long-Term Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers 
We have developed long-term relationships with our federal, state and other governmental customers, which we believe enhance our ability
to win new contracts and retain existing business. We have provided correctional and detention management services to the United States Federal Government for 25 years, the State of California for 24 years, the State of Texas for
approximately 24 years, various Australian state government entities for 20 years and the State of Florida for approximately 18 years. These customers accounted for approximately 66.5% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year
ended January 1, 2012. The acquisitions of Cornell and BI have increased our business with our three largest federal clients: the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Marshals Service and ICE. The BI Acquisition also provided us with a new
service offering for ICE, our largest client.  Recurring Revenue with Strong Cash Flow 
Our revenue base is derived from our long-term customer relationships, with contract renewal rates and facility occupancy rates both
approximating 90% over the past five years. We have been able to expand our revenue base by continuing to reinvest our strong operating cash flow into expansionary projects and through strategic acquisitions that provide scale and further enhance
our service offerings. Our consolidated revenues have grown from $976.3 million in 2007 to $1.6 billion in 2011. We expect our operating cash flow to be well in excess of our anticipated annual maintenance capital expenditure needs, which
would provide us flexibility for growth capital expenditures, acquisitions and/or the repayment of indebtedness.  Unique
Privatized Mental Health, Residential Treatment and Community-Based Services Growth Platform  With the acquisitions of
Cornell and BI, we have significantly expanded the service offerings of GEO Cares privatized mental health and residential treatment services business by adding substantial adult community-based residential operations, as well as new
operations in community-based youth behavioral treatment services, electronic monitoring services and community re-entry and immigration related supervision services. Through both organic growth and acquisitions we have been able to grow GEO
Cares business to approximately 4,700 beds at 27 mental health and community-based residential facilities, the ability to provide treatment and other services at 19 residential and non-residential facilities and the monitoring of approximately
70,000 offenders in a community-based environment generating aggregate revenues of $426.8 million for fiscal year ended 2011 from 1,773 beds at 6 residential facilities generating revenues of $110.2 million for fiscal year ended 2007. We
believe that GEO Cares service offerings of providing diversified mental health, residential treatment, community-based services and monitoring services uniquely position us to meet client demands for solutions that improve successful society
re-integration rates for offenders throughout the corrections system.  Sizeable International Business
 Our international infrastructure, which leverages our operational excellence in the U.S., allows us to aggressively
target foreign opportunities that our U.S. based competitors without overseas operations may have difficulty pursuing. We currently have international operations in Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Our International
services business generated $215.5 million of revenues, representing 13.4% of our consolidated revenues, for the year ended January 1, 2012. We believe we are well positioned to continue benefiting from foreign governments
initiatives to outsource correctional services.  Experienced, Proven Senior Management Team 
Our Chief Executive Officer and the Founder, George C. Zoley, Ph.D., has led our Company for 27 years and has established a track
record of growth and profitability. Under his leadership, our annual consolidated revenues from continuing operations have grown from $40.0 million in 1991 to $1.6 billion in 2011. Mr. Zoley is one of the pioneers of the industry, having
developed and opened what we believe to be one of the first privatized detention facilities in the U.S. in 1986. Our Chief Financial Officer, Brian R. Evans, has been with our company for over eleven years and has led the integration of our
recent acquisitions and financing activities. Our top seven senior executives have an average tenure with our company of over ten years.

Business Strategies  Provide High Quality, Comprehensive Services and Cost Savings Throughout the Corrections Lifecycle  Our objective is to provide federal, state and local governmental agencies with a comprehensive offering of high quality, essential services at a lower cost than they themselves could achieve. We believe
government agencies facing budgetary constraints will increasingly seek to outsource a greater proportion of their correctional needs to reliable providers that can enhance quality of service at a reduced cost. We believe our expanded and
diversified service offerings uniquely position us to bundle our high quality services and provide a comprehensive continuum of care for our clients, which we believe will lead to lower cost outcomes for our clients and larger scale business
opportunities for us.  Maintain Disciplined Operating Approach 
We refrain from pursuing contracts that we do not believe will yield attractive profit margins in relation to the associated operational
risks. In addition, although we engage in facility development from time to time without having a corresponding management contract award in place, we endeavor to do so only where we have determined that there is medium to long-term client demand
for a facility in that geographical area. We have also elected not to enter certain international markets with a history of economic and political instability. We believe that our strategy of emphasizing lower risk, higher profit opportunities helps
us to consistently deliver strong operational performance, lower our costs and increase our overall profitability. 
Pursue International Growth Opportunities  As a global provider of privatized correctional services, we are able to capitalize on opportunities to operate existing or new facilities on behalf of foreign governments. We have seen increased business
development opportunities in recent years in the international markets in which we operate and are currently bidding on several new projects. We will continue to actively bid on new international projects in our current markets and in new markets
that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. We also intend to cross sell our expanded service offerings into these markets, including the electronic monitoring and supervision services which we acquired in the BI Acquisition.
 Selectively Pursue Acquisition Opportunities 
We intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that fit our
strategic objectives and enhance our geographic platform and service offerings. Since 2005, and including the BI Acquisition, we have completed six acquisitions for total consideration, including debt assumed, in excess of $1.7 billion. Our
management team utilizes a disciplined approach to analyze and evaluate acquisition opportunities, which we believe has contributed to our success in completing and integrating our acquisitions.

(1)
Capacity as used in the table refers to operational capacity consisting of total beds for all facilities except for the seven Non-residential service centers under
Youth Services for which we have provided service capacity which represents the number of juveniles that can be serviced daily. 


(2)
For Youth Services Residential Facilities and Non-residential Service Centers, the contract commencement date represents either the program start date or the date that
the facility operations were acquired by Cornell. The service agreements under these arrangements, with the exception of Schaffner Youth Center, provide for services on an as-contracted basis and there are no guaranteed minimum populations or
management contracts with specified renewal dates. These arrangements are more perpetual in nature. 


(3)
In June 2011, we announced that the City of Adelanto, California signed a contract with us for the housing of federal immigration detainees at our existing 650-bed
Detention Facility in Adelanto, California, and at a 650-bed facility expansion we are constructing on land adjacent to the facility. We completed the renovation and retrofitting of the existing 650-bed facility and began the initial intake of 650
detainees in August 2011. We expect to complete the new 650-bed expansion and begin the intake of the additional 650 detainees by August 2012. 


(4)
These facilities are classified as Assets Held for Sale as of January 1, 2012. We sold Baker Community Correctional Facility in January 2012.



(5)
This contract renewal period expired June 30, 2011 and was extended on a month-to-month basis until it was terminated effective January 22, 2012.



(6)
The Company was notified by the CDCR in January 2012 that this contract would terminate effective July 1, 2012 due to lack of funding. 


(7)
GEO provides services at these facilities through various Inter-Governmental Agreements, or IGAs, through the various counties and other jurisdictions.



(8)

The Colorado Day Reporting Centers provide many of the same services as the full service Day Reporting Centers, but rather than providing these services through
comprehensive treatment plans dictated by the governing authority, these services are provided on a fee for service basis. Such services may be connected to government agency contracts and would be reimbursed by those agencies. Other services are
offered directly to offenders allowing them to meet court-ordered requirements and paid by the offender as the service is provided.

Government Contracts  Terminations, Renewals and Competitive Re-bids 
Generally, we may lose our facility management contracts due to one of three reasons: the termination by a government customer with or
without cause at any time; the failure by a customer to renew a contract with us upon the expiration of the then current term; or our failure to win the right to continue to operate under a contract that has been competitively re-bid in a
procurement process upon its termination or expiration. Our facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to
180 days. If government agencies were to use these provisions to terminate, or renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Risk
Factors  We are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure
new facility management contracts from other government customers.  Aside from our customers unilateral right to
terminate our facility management contracts with them at any time for any reason, there are two points during the typical lifecycle of a contract which may result in the loss by us of a facility management contract with our customers. We refer to
these points as contract renewals and contract re-bids. Many of our facility management contracts with our government customers have an initial fixed term and subsequent renewal rights for one or more additional periods at
the unilateral option of the customer. Because most of our contracts for youth services do not guarantee placement or revenue, we have not considered these contracts to ever be in the renewal or re-bid stage since they are more perpetual in nature.
As such, the contracts for youth services are not considered as renewals or rebids nor are they included in the table below. We count each government customers right to renew a particular facility management contract for an additional period
as a separate renewal. For example, a five-year initial fixed term contract with customer options to renew for five separate additional one-year periods would, if fully exercised, be counted as five separate renewals, with one renewal
coming in each of the five years following the initial term. As of January 1, 2012, 54 of our facility management contracts representing approximately 21,000 beds are scheduled to expire on or before December 30, 2012, unless renewed by
the customer at its sole option in certain cases, or unless renewed by mutual agreement in other cases. These contracts represented 26.3% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012. We undertake substantial efforts
to renew our facility management contracts. Our average historical facility management contract renewal approximates 90%. However, given their unilateral nature, we cannot assure you that our customers will in fact exercise their renewal options
under existing contracts. In addition, in connection with contract renewals, either we or the contracting government agency have typically requested changes or adjustments to contractual terms. As a result, contract renewals may be made on terms
that are more or less favorable to us than those in existence prior to the renewals.  We define competitive re-bids as
contracts currently under our management which we believe, based on our experience with the customer and the facility involved, will be re-bid to us and other potential service providers in a competitive procurement process upon the expiration or
termination of our contract, assuming all renewal options are exercised. Our determination of which contracts we believe will be competitively re-bid may in some cases be subjective and judgmental, based largely on our knowledge of the dynamics
involving a particular contract, the customer and the facility involved. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial fixed term plus any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract
by a customer. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to encourage competitive pricing and other terms for the government customer. Potential bidders in competitive re-bid
situations include us, other private operators and other government entities. While we are pleased with our historical win rate on competitive re-bids and are committed to continuing to bid competitively on appropriate future competitive re-bid
opportunities, we cannot in fact assure you that we will prevail in future competitive re-bid situations. Also, we cannot assure you that any competitive re-bids we win will be on terms more favorable to us than those in existence with respect to
the expiring contract.

Table of Contents
As of January 1, 2012, 14 of our facility management contracts representing 1.6% and
$26.1 million of our fiscal year 2011 consolidated revenues are subject to competitive re-bid in 2012. The following table sets forth the number of facility management contracts that we currently believe will be subject to competitive re-bid in
each of the next five years and thereafter, and the total number of beds relating to those potential competitive re-bid situations during each period:

 In addition to the facility management contracts subject to competitive re-bid in the table above,
certain other of our management contracts are also subject to competitive re-bid including our contract to provide services to ICE under the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program which is subject to competitive re-bid in 2014. We generated
revenues under this contract during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 of $37.8 million, or 2.4%, of our consolidated revenues. 
Competition  We compete
primarily on the basis of the quality and range of services we offer; our experience domestically and internationally in the design, construction, and management of privatized correctional and detention facilities; our reputation; and our pricing.
We compete directly with the public sector, where governmental agencies responsible for the operation of correctional, detention, youth services, community based services, and mental health, residential treatment and re-entry facilities are often
seeking to retain projects that might otherwise be privatized. In the private sector, our U.S. Corrections & Detention and International Services business segments compete with a number of companies, including, but not limited to:
Corrections Corporation of America; Management and Training Corporation; Louisiana Corrections Services, Inc.; Emerald Companies; Community Education Centers; LaSalle Southwest Corrections; Group 4 Securicor; Sodexo Justice Services (formerly
Kaylx); and Serco. Our GEO Care business segment competes with a number of different small-to-medium sized companies, reflecting the highly fragmented nature of the youth services, community based services, and mental health and residential
treatment services industry. BIs electronic monitoring business segment competes with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: G4 Justice Services, LLC; Elmo-Tech, a 3M Company; and Pro-Tech, a 3M Company. Some of our competitors
are larger and have more resources than we do. We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance. 
Employees and Employee Training  At January 1, 2012, we had 18,894 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 273 were employed at our headquarters and regional offices and 18,621 were employed at facilities and
international offices. We employ personnel in positions of management, administrative and clerical, security, educational services, human services, health services and general maintenance at our various locations. Approximately 1,651 and
1,839 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the United States and at international offices, respectively. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
Under the laws applicable to most of our operations, and internal company policies, our correctional officers are required to complete a
minimum amount of training. We generally require at least 40 hours of pre-service training before an employee is allowed to assume their duties plus an additional 120 hours of training during their

  25 


Table of Contents

first year of employment in our domestic facilities, consistent with ACA standards and/or applicable state laws. In addition to the usual 160 hours of training in the first year, most states
require 40 or 80 hours of on-the-job training. Florida law requires that correctional officers receive 520 hours of training. We believe that our training programs meet or exceed all applicable requirements. 
Our training program for domestic facilities typically begins with approximately 40 hours of instruction regarding our policies,
operational procedures and management philosophy. Training continues with an additional 120 hours of instruction covering legal issues, rights of inmates, techniques of communication and supervision, interpersonal skills and job training
relating to the particular position to be held. Each of our employees who has contact with inmates receives a minimum of 40 hours of additional training each year, and each manager receives at least 24 hours of training each year.
 At least 160 hours of training are required for our employees in Australia and South Africa before such employees are
allowed to work in positions that will bring them into contact with inmates. Our employees in Australia and South Africa receive a minimum of 40 hours of refresher training each year. In the United Kingdom, our corrections employees also
receive a minimum of 240 hours prior to coming in contact with inmates and receive additional training of approximately 25 hours annually.  With respect to BI and the ISAP services contract, new employees are required to complete training requirements as outlined in the contract within 14 days of hire and prior to being assigned autonomous
ISAP related duties. These employees receive 25 hours of refresher training annually thereafter. Program managers for our ISAP contract must receive 24 hours of additional initial training. BIs Monitoring Services maintains its own
comprehensive certification and training program for all Monitoring Service Specialists. We require all new personnel hired for a position in Monitoring Operations to complete a seven-week training program. Successful completion of our training
program training and a final certification is required of all of our personnel performing monitoring operations. We require that certification is achieved prior to being permitted to work independently in the call center. 
Business Regulations and Legal Considerations  Many governmental agencies are required to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts for products or services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award
subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract or partner with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups. 
Certain states, such as Florida, deem correctional officers to be peace officers and require our personnel to be licensed and subject to
background investigation. State law also typically requires correctional officers to meet certain training standards.  The
failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the loss of any required license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our current and future operations
may be subject to additional regulations as a result of, among other factors, new statutes and regulations and changes in the manner in which existing statutes and regulations are or may be interpreted or applied. Any such additional regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Insurance 
The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims
relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment
matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other
damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages 
  26 


Table of Contents

arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any
damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we
carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order
to take advantage of certain economies of scale.  We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability
policies with total limits of $67.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of U.S. Corrections & Detention, GEO Cares community based services, GEO Cares youth services and BI. In addition, GEO
Cares residential treatment services division has a separate claims-made liability insurance program for their mental health facilities with a specific loss limit of $35.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. That same $35.0 million
limit also applies to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services. We are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including,
workers compensation, environmental liability and automobile liability.  For most casualty insurance policies, we carry
substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $3.0 million per occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers compensation and $1.0 million per
occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have
been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure, mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest, may
prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value.  With respect to our operations in South Africa,
the United Kingdom and Australia, we utilize a combination of locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the Company. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail
insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract.  Of the reserves discussed above, our most
significant insurance reserves relate to workers compensation and general liability claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $45.3 million and $40.2 million as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively.
We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical
frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be
impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the
estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies,
the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be materially adversely impacted.  International Operations 
Our international operations for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 consisted of the operations of our wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries, our
wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, and South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited, our consolidated joint venture in South Africa, which we refer to as SACM. In Australia, our wholly-owned subsidiary, GEO Australia, currently
manages four facilities and provides comprehensive healthcare services to nine government operated prisons. We operate one facility in South Africa through SACM. During Fourth Quarter 2004, we opened an office in the United Kingdom to pursue new

Item 1A.
Risk Factors 
The following are certain risks to which our business operations are subject. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, or results of operations. These risks could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not
the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.  Risks Related to Our High Level of Indebtedness  Our significant
level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations.  We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our total consolidated indebtedness as of January 1, 2012 was $1,338.4 million, excluding non-recourse debt of $241.8 million and capital lease
obligations of $14.2 million. As of January 1, 2012, we had $58.6 million outstanding in letters of credit and $302.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. Also as of January 1, 2012, we had the ability to
borrow $139.4 million under the Revolver, after applying the limitations and restrictions in our debt covenants and subject to our satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions under the Senior Credit Facility with respect to the incurrence of
additional indebtedness.  Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
 


 

 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes; 
  28 


Table of Contents


 

 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
 


 

 
 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 


 

 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may be less leveraged; and 
 


 

 
 limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms. 
If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to reduce capital expenditures, restructure or
refinance our indebtedness, obtain additional equity financing or sell assets. We may be unable to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, our ability
to incur additional indebtedness will be restricted by the terms of our senior credit facility, the indenture governing the
7 3/4% senior notes and the indenture governing the
6.625% Senior Notes.  We are incurring significant indebtedness in connection with substantial ongoing capital
expenditures. Capital expenditures for existing and future projects may materially strain our liquidity.  As of
January 1, 2012, we were developing a number of projects that we estimate will cost approximately $245.8 million, of which $156.1 million was spent through January 1, 2012. We estimate our remaining capital requirements to be
approximately $89.7 million, which we anticipate will be spent in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Capital expenditures related to facility maintenance costs are expected to range between $30.0 million and $35.0 million for fiscal year
2012. We intend to finance these and future projects using our own funds, including cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolver portion of our Senior Credit Facility. In addition to these current estimated capital
requirements for 2012 and 2013, we are currently in the process of bidding on, or evaluating potential bids for the design, construction and management of a number of new projects. In the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to
self-finance their construction, our capital requirements in 2012 and/or 2013 could materially increase. As of January 1, 2012, we had the ability to borrow $139.4 million under the revolver portion of our Senior Credit Facility after
applying the limitations and restrictions in our debt covenants and subject to our satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, we have the ability to borrow $250.0 million under the accordion
feature of our Senior Credit Facility subject to lender demand and prevailing market conditions and satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions thereunder. While we believe we currently have adequate borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit
Facility to fund our operations and all of our committed capital expenditure projects, we may need additional borrowings or financing from other sources in order to complete potential capital expenditures related to new projects in the future. We
cannot assure you that such borrowings or financing will be made available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, the large capital commitments that these projects will require over the next 12-18 month period may materially
strain our liquidity and our borrowing capacity for other purposes. Capital constraints caused by these projects may also cause us to have to entirely refinance our existing indebtedness or incur more indebtedness. Such financing may have terms less
favorable than those we currently have in place, or not be available to us at all. In addition, the concurrent development of these and other large capital projects exposes us to material risks. For example, we may not complete some or all of the
projects on time or on budget, which could cause us to absorb any losses associated with any delays.  Despite current
indebtedness levels, we may still incur more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.  The terms of the indenture governing the 7 3/4% senior notes, the indenture governing the 6.625% senior notes and our Senior Credit Facility restrict our ability to incur but do not prohibit us from incurring significant additional indebtedness
in the future. As of January 1, 2012, we had the ability to borrow an additional $139.4 million under the revolver portion of our Senior Credit Facility after applying the limitations and restrictions in our debt covenants and subject to
our satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions under the Senior Credit Facility. We also would have had the ability to borrow an additional $250.0 million under the accordion

Table of Contents

feature of our senior credit facility subject to lender demand, prevailing market conditions and satisfying relevant borrowing conditions. Also, we may refinance all or a portion of our
indebtedness, including borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility, the 7 3/4% Senior Notes and/or the 6.625% Senior Notes. The terms of such refinancing may be less restrictive and permit us to incur more indebtedness than we can now. If new indebtedness is added to our and
our subsidiaries current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face related to our significant level of indebtedness could intensify. 
The covenants in the indenture governing the 7 3/4% Senior Notes, the indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes and
our Senior Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
The indenture governing the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, the indenture governing the
6.625% Senior Notes and our Senior Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries, which we refer to as restricted subsidiaries. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other
things:   


 

 
 incur additional indebtedness;   


 

 
 pay dividends and or distributions on our capital stock, repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock, prepay subordinated indebtedness, make
investments;   


 

 
 issue preferred stock of subsidiaries;   


 

 
 guarantee other indebtedness;   


 

 
 create liens on our assets;   


 

 
 transfer and sell assets;   


 

 
 make capital expenditures above certain limits;   


 

 
 create or permit restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or make other distributions to us;
  


 

 
 enter into sale/leaseback transactions;   


 

 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; and   


 

 
 merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
These restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or
pursue available business opportunities. In addition, our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants, including maintaining maximum senior secured leverage ratio and total
leverage ratios, and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Some of these financial ratios become more restrictive over the life of the Senior Credit Facility. We may be required to take action to reduce our indebtedness or to act in a manner contrary
to our business objectives to meet these ratios and satisfy these covenants. We could also incur additional indebtedness having even more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility, the
indenture governing the 7 3/4% Senior Notes and the
indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes or any other indebtedness could prevent us from being able to draw on the revolver portion of our Senior Credit Facility, cause an event of default under such documents and result in an acceleration
of all of our outstanding indebtedness. If all of our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated, we likely would not be able to simultaneously satisfy all of our obligations under such indebtedness, which would materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.  Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of
cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.  Our ability to make payments on our
indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are
beyond our control. 
  30 


Table of Contents
Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our Senior Credit Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or debt securities, including the 7 3/4% Senior Notes and the 6.625% Senior Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. However, we may not be able to complete such refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
Because portions of our senior indebtedness have floating interest rates, a general increase in interest rates will adversely
affect cash flows.  Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate. As a result, to the
extent our exposure to increases in interest rates is not eliminated through interest rate protection agreements, such increases will result in higher debt service costs which will adversely affect our cash flows. We currently do not have interest
rate protection agreements in place to protect against interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. As of January 1, 2012 we had $783.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility (net
of discount of $1.5 million), and a one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the Senior Credit Facility would increase our annual interest expense by $7.8 million. 
We depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to make payments on our indebtedness. These distributions may not be made.
 A substantial portion of our business is conducted by our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to meet our payment
obligations on our indebtedness is substantially dependent on the earnings of certain of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries as dividends, loans, advances or other payments. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct
legal entities and, unless they expressly guarantee any indebtedness of ours, they are not obligated to make funds available for payment of our indebtedness in the form of loans, distributions or otherwise. Our subsidiaries ability to make any
such loans, distributions or other payments to us will depend on their earnings, business results, the terms of their existing and any future indebtedness, tax considerations and legal or contractual restrictions to which they may be subject. If our
subsidiaries do not make such payments to us, our ability to repay our indebtedness may be materially adversely affected. For the year ended January 1, 2012, our subsidiaries accounted for 68.9% of our consolidated revenues, and as of
January 1, 2012, our subsidiaries accounted for 75.7% of our total assets.  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
From time to time, we may not have a management contract with a client to operate existing beds at a facility or new beds at a
facility that we are expanding and we cannot assure you that such a contract will be obtained. Failure to obtain a management contract for these beds will subject us to carrying costs with no corresponding management revenue. 
From time to time, we may not have a management contract with a client to operate existing beds or new beds at facilities that we are
currently in the process of renovating and expanding. While we will always strive to work diligently with a number of different customers for the use of these beds, we cannot assure you that a contract for the beds will be secured on a timely basis,
or at all. While a facility or new beds at a facility are vacant, we incur carrying costs. We are currently marketing approximately 7,700 vacant beds at nine of our idle facilities to potential customers. The annual carrying cost of idle facilities
in 2012 is estimated to be $16.6 million, including depreciation expense of $8.1 million, if the facilities remain vacant for the remainder of 2012. As of January 1, 2012, these facilities had a net book value of $297.3 million. The Company reviews
its facilities for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net book value of the facility may not be recoverable. Impairment charges taken on our facilities could require material non-cash charges to our results of
operations. In addition, in order to secure a management contract for these beds, we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to renovate or further expand the facility to meet potential clients needs.

Table of Contents
Negative conditions in the capital markets could prevent us from obtaining financing,
which could materially harm our business.  Our ability to obtain additional financing is highly dependent on the
conditions of the capital markets, among other things. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing significant volatility and disruption since 2008. The downturn in the equity and debt markets, the tightening of the credit markets, the
general economic slowdown and other macroeconomic conditions, such as the current global economic environment could prevent us from raising additional capital or obtaining additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we need, but cannot
obtain, adequate capital as a result of negative conditions in the capital markets or otherwise, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, such inability to obtain capital could
prevent us from pursuing attractive business development opportunities, including new facility constructions or expansions of existing facilities, and business or asset acquisitions. 
We are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts, due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which
could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers.  We are exposed to the risk that we may lose our facility management contracts primarily due to one of three reasons: the termination by a government customer with or without cause at any time; the failure
by a customer to exercise its unilateral option to renew a contract with us upon the expiration of the then current term; or our failure to win the right to continue to operate under a contract that has been competitively re-bid in a procurement
process upon its termination or expiration. Our facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days.
If government agencies were to use these provisions to terminate, or renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
Aside from our customers unilateral right to terminate our facility management contracts with them at any time for any reason,
there are two points during the typical lifecycle of a contract which may result in the loss by us of a facility management contract with our customers. We refer to these points as contract renewals and contract re-bids. Many
of our facility management contracts with our government customers have an initial fixed term and subsequent renewal rights for one or more additional periods at the unilateral option of the customer. Because most of our contracts for youth services
do not guarantee placement or revenue, we have not considered these contracts to ever be in the renewal or re-bid stage since they are more perpetual in nature. We count each government customers right to renew a particular facility management
contract for an additional period as a separate renewal. For example, a five-year initial fixed term contract with customer options to renew for five separate additional one-year periods would, if fully exercised, be counted as five
separate renewals, with one renewal coming in each of the five years following the initial term. As of January 1, 2012, 54 of our facility management contracts representing approximately 21,000 beds are scheduled to expire on or before
December 30, 2012, unless renewed by the customer at its sole option in certain cases, or unless renewed by mutual agreement in other cases. These contracts represented 26.3% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended
January 1, 2012. We undertake substantial efforts to renew our facility management contracts. Our average historical facility management contract renewal rate approximates 90%. However, given their unilateral nature, we cannot assure you that
our customers will in fact exercise their renewal options under existing contracts. In addition, in connection with contract renewals, either we or the contracting government agency have typically requested changes or adjustments to contractual
terms. As a result, contract renewals may be made on terms that are more or less favorable to us than those in existence prior to the renewals.  We define competitive re-bids as contracts currently under our management which we believe, based on our experience with the customer and the facility involved, will be re-bid to us and other potential
service providers in a competitive procurement process upon the expiration or termination of our contract, assuming all renewal 
  32 


Table of Contents

options are exercised. Our determination of which contracts we believe will be competitively re-bid may in some cases be subjective and judgmental, based largely on our knowledge of the dynamics
involving a particular contract, the customer and the facility involved. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial fixed term plus any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract
by a customer. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to further competitive pricing and other terms for the government customer. Potential bidders in competitive re-bid
situations include us, other private operators and other government entities.  As of January 1, 2012, 14 of our facility
management contracts representing $26.1 million (or 1.6%) of our consolidated revenues for the year ended January 1, 2012 are subject to competitive re-bid in 2012. While we are pleased with our historical win rate on competitive re-bids
and are committed to continuing to bid competitively on appropriate future competitive re-bid opportunities, we cannot in fact assure you that we will prevail in future re-bid situations. Also, we cannot assure you that any competitive re-bids we
win will be on terms more favorable to us than those in existence with respect to the expiring contract.  For additional
information on facility management contracts that we currently believe will be competitively re-bid during each of the next five years and thereafter, please see Business  Government Contracts  Terminations, Renewals and
Competitive Re-bids. The loss by us of facility management contracts due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, including our ability
to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers.  We may not fully realize the anticipated
synergies and related benefits of acquisitions or we may not fully realize the anticipated synergies within the anticipated timing.  We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of
duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. For at least the first year after a substantial acquisition, and possibly longer, the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating
the businesses and operations. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing
of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  As a
result of our acquisitions, we have recorded and will continue to record a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. In the future, our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which could result in material
non-cash charges to our results of operations.  We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets
resulting from business acquisitions. As of January 1, 2012 we had $708.4 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying
value as defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if there are changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels,
operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations.

Our growth depends on our ability to secure contracts to develop and manage new
correctional, detention and mental health facilities and to secure contracts to provide electronic monitoring services, community-based re-entry services and monitoring and supervision services, the demand for which is outside our control.
 Our growth is primarily dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional,
detention and mental health facilities, because contracts to manage existing public facilities have not to date typically been offered to private operators. Additionally, our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to
offer electronic monitoring services, provide community-based re-entry services and provide monitoring and supervision services. Public sector demand for new privatized facilities in our areas of operation may decrease and our potential for growth
will depend on a number of factors we cannot control, including overall economic conditions, governmental and public acceptance of the concept of privatization, government budgetary constraints, and the number of facilities available for
privatization.  In particular, the demand for our correctional and detention facilities and services, electronic monitoring
services, community-based re-entry services and monitoring and supervision services could be adversely affected by changes in existing criminal or immigration laws, crime rates in jurisdictions in which we operate, the relaxation of criminal or
immigration enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction, sentencing or deportation practices, and the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws or the loosening of immigration laws. For example, any
changes with respect to the decriminalization of drugs and controlled substances could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, sentenced and incarcerated, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.
Similarly, reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities. Immigration reform laws which are currently a focus for legislators and politicians at the
federal, state and local level also could materially adversely impact us. Various factors outside our control could adversely impact the growth of our GEO Care business, including government customer resistance to the privatization of mental health
or residential treatment facilities, and changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.  We may not be able to
meet state requirements for capital investment or locate land for the development of new facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. 
Certain jurisdictions, including California, have in the past required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in
connection with the financing of a particular project. If this trend were to continue in the future, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital resources when needed to compete effectively for facility management contracts. Additionally, our
success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend, in part, upon our ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired under favorable terms. Otherwise desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and, therefore, may generate
legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site. Our inability to secure financing and desirable locations for new facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.
 We depend on a limited number of governmental customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of, or a
significant decrease in business from, these customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations.  We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of governmental agencies. Of our governmental clients, four customers accounted for over
50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended January 1, 2012. In addition, three federal governmental agencies with correctional and detention responsibilities, the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service, accounted
for 39.9% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended January 1, 2012, with the Bureau of Prisons accounting for 16.0% of our total consolidated revenues for such period, ICE accounting for 13.4% of our total consolidated revenues for
such period, and the U.S. Marshals Service accounting for 10.5% of our total consolidated revenues for such period. Government agencies from the State of Florida accounted for 10.6% of 
  34 


Table of Contents

our total consolidated revenues for the year ended January 1, 2012. The loss of, or a significant decrease in, business from the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, U.S. Marshals Service, the State
of Florida or any other significant customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to depend upon these federal and state agencies and a relatively small group of other governmental customers
for a significant percentage of our revenues.  A decrease in occupancy levels could cause a decrease in revenues and
profitability.  While a substantial portion of our cost structure is generally fixed, most of our revenues are
generated under facility management contracts which provide for per diem payments based upon daily occupancy. Several of these contracts provide minimum revenue guarantees for us, regardless of occupancy levels, up to a specified maximum occupancy
percentage. However, many of our contracts have no minimum revenue guarantees and simply provide for a fixed per diem payment for each inmate/detainee/patient actually housed. As a result, with respect to our contracts that have no minimum revenue
guarantees and those that guarantee revenues only up to a certain specified occupancy percentage, we are highly dependent upon the governmental agencies with which we have contracts to provide inmates, detainees and patients for our managed
facilities. Under a per diem rate structure, a decrease in our occupancy rates could cause a decrease in revenues and profitability. Recently, the State of California implemented its Criminal Justice Realignment Plan. As a result of the
implementation of the Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, the State of California discontinued contracts with Community Correctional Facilities which housed low level state offenders across the state. The implementation of the Criminal Justice
Realignment Plan by California resulted in the cancellation of our agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of our California Community Corrections facilities as well as an agreement for the housing of out-of-state California
inmates at our North Lake Correctional Facility in Michigan. In January 2012, we also received notice from the CDCR of its intention to terminate the contract at Golden State Medium Community Correctional Facility effective July 1, 2012. Also,
in Michigan there have been recommendations for the early release of inmates to relieve overcrowding conditions. When combined with relatively fixed costs for operating each facility, regardless of the occupancy level, a material decrease in
occupancy levels at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability, and consequently, on our financial condition and results of operations. 
State budgetary constraints may have a material adverse impact on us. 
While most states anticipate revenues to increase in fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011, several states still face budget
shortfalls. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 38 states faced budget gaps when they were enacting their fiscal 2012 budgets, and new budget gaps could develop before fiscal year 2012 ends. At January 1, 2012, we had
twelve state correctional clients: Florida, Georgia, Alaska, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia, Indiana, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Effective October 1, 2011, the State of California began implementing its Criminal
Justice Realignment Plan, which is expected to delegate tens of thousands of low level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in California. As a result of this decision, we received written notice from the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation regarding the cancellation of our agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of our California community corrections facilities as well as an agreement for the housing of out-of-state California
inmates at our North Lake Correctional Facility in Michigan. If state budgetary constraints persist or intensify, our state customers may choose to implement plans similar to Californias Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, our twelve state
customers ability to pay us may be impaired and/or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts with those customers on less favorable terms and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially
adversely impacted. In addition, budgetary constraints in states that are not our current customers could prevent those states from outsourcing correctional, detention or mental health service opportunities that we otherwise could have pursued.

Competition for inmates may adversely affect the profitability of our business.
 We compete with government entities and other private operators on the basis of cost, quality and range of services
offered, experience in managing facilities, and reputation of management and personnel. Barriers to entering the market for the management of correctional and detention facilities may not be sufficient to limit additional competition in our
industry. In addition, some of our government customers may assume the management of a facility currently managed by us upon the termination of the corresponding management contract or, if such customers have capacity at the facilities which they
operate, they may take inmates currently housed in our facilities and transfer them to government operated facilities. Since we are paid on a per diem basis with no minimum guaranteed occupancy under some of our contracts, the loss of such inmates
and resulting decrease in occupancy could cause a decrease in both our revenues and our profitability.  We are dependent
on government appropriations, which may not be made on a timely basis or at all and may be adversely impacted by budgetary constraints at the federal, state and local levels. 
Our cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental
entities. If the contracting governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations, it may terminate our contract or delay or reduce payment to us. Any delays in payment, or the termination of a
contract, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition, which may make it difficult to satisfy our payment obligations on our indebtedness, including the 6.625% Senior Notes, the 7 3/4% Senior Notes and the Senior Credit Facility, in a timely manner.
In addition, as a result of, among other things, recent economic developments, federal, state and local governments have encountered, and may continue to encounter, unusual budgetary constraints. As a result, a number of state and local governments
are under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending which could limit or eliminate appropriations for the facilities that we operate. Additionally, as a result of these factors, we may be requested in the future to
reduce our existing per diem contract rates or forego prospective increases to those rates. Budgetary limitations may also make it more difficult for us to renew our existing contracts on favorable terms or at all. Further, a number of states in
which we operate are experiencing significant budget deficits for fiscal year 2012. We cannot assure that these deficits will not result in reductions in per diems, delays in payment for services rendered or unilateral termination of contracts.
 Public resistance to privatization of correctional, detention, mental health and residential facilities could
result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The management and operation of correctional, detention, mental health and residential facilities by private entities has not achieved
complete acceptance by either government agencies or the public. Some governmental agencies have limitations on their ability to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for such facilities to private companies and additional
legislative changes or prohibitions could occur that further increase these limitations. In addition, the movement toward privatization of such facilities has encountered resistance from groups, such as labor unions, that believe that correctional,
detention, mental health and residential facilities should only be operated by governmental agencies. Changes in governing political parties could also result in significant changes to previously established views of privatization. Increased public
resistance to the privatization of correctional, detention, mental health and residential facilities in any of the markets in which we operate, as a result of these or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our GEO Care business, which has become a material part of our consolidated revenues,
poses unique risks not associated with our other businesses.  Our GEO Care business segment operates our mental health
and residential treatment services, youth services and community-based services divisions. The GEO Care business primarily involves the delivery of quality care, innovative educational and rehabilitative programming, active patient treatment
services, employment assistance and monitoring services at state-owned mental health care facilities, jails, sexually violent offender facilities, community-based service facilities and/ or long-term care facilities. GEO Cares business has
increased substantially over the last few years, both in general and as a percentage of our overall business. For the year ended January 1, 2012, GEO Care generated $426.8 million in revenues, representing 26.4% of our consolidated
revenues from continuing operations. GEO Cares business poses several material risks unique to its operation that do not exist in our core business of correctional and detention facilities management, including, but not limited to, the
following:   


 

 
 the concept of the privatization of the mental health and residential treatment services provided by GEO Care has not yet achieved general acceptance
by either government agencies or the public, which could materially limit GEO Cares growth prospects;   


 

 
 GEO Cares business is highly dependent on the continuous recruitment, hiring and retention of a substantial pool of qualified psychiatrists,
physicians, nurses and other medically trained personnel as well as counselors and social workers which may not be available in the quantities or locations sought, or on the employment terms offered; 
 


 

 
 GEO Cares business model often involves taking over outdated or obsolete facilities and operating them while it supervises the construction and
development of new, more updated facilities; during this transition period, GEO Care may be particularly vulnerable to operational difficulties primarily relating to or resulting from the deteriorating nature of the older existing
facilities; and   


 

 
 the facilities operated by GEO Care are substantially dependent on government funding, including in some cases the receipt of Medicare and Medicaid
funding; the loss of such government funding for any reason with respect to any facilities operated by GEO Care could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
Operating juvenile correctional facilities poses certain unique or increased risks and difficulties compared to operating other
facilities.  As a result of the Cornell Acquisition in 2010, we re-entered the market of operating juvenile
correctional facilities. We intentionally had exited the market of operating juvenile correctional facilities a number of years prior to the Cornell Acquisition. Operating juvenile correctional facilities may pose increased operational risks and
difficulties that may result in increased litigation, higher personnel costs, higher levels of turnover of personnel and reduced profitability. Additionally, juvenile services contracts related to educational services may provide for annual
collection several months after a school year is completed. We cannot assure that we will be successful in operating juvenile correctional facilities or that we will be able to minimize the risks and difficulties involved while yielding an
attractive profit margin.  Adverse publicity may negatively impact our ability to retain existing contracts and obtain
new contracts.  Any negative publicity about an escape, riot or other disturbance or perceived poor conditions at a
privately managed facility, any failures experienced by our electronic monitoring services or the loss or unauthorized access to any of the data we maintain in the course of providing our services may result in publicity adverse to us and the
private corrections industry in general. Any of these occurrences or continued trends may make it more difficult for us to renew existing contracts or to obtain new contracts or could result in the termination of an existing contract or the closure
of one or more of our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such negative events may also result in a significant increase in our liability insurance costs. 
  37 


Table of Contents
We may incur significant start-up and operating costs on new contracts before
receiving related revenues, which may impact our cash flows and not be recouped.  When we are
awarded a contract to manage a facility, we may incur significant start-up and operating expenses, including the cost of constructing the facility, purchasing equipment and staffing the facility, before we receive any payments under the contract.
These expenditures could result in a significant reduction in our cash reserves and may make it more difficult for us to meet other cash obligations, including our payment obligations on the 6.625% Senior Notes, the 7 3/4% Senior Notes and the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, a
contract may be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration and as a result we may not recover these expenditures or realize any return on our investment.  Failure to comply with extensive government regulation and applicable contractual requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, including educational,
environmental, health care and safety laws, rules and regulations, which are administered by many regulatory authorities. Some of the regulations are unique to the corrections industry, and the combination of regulations affects all areas of our
operations. Corrections officers and juvenile care workers are customarily required to meet certain training standards and, in some instances, facility personnel are required to be licensed and are subject to background investigations. Certain
jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups. We may not always successfully comply with these and other regulations to which we are subject and
failure to comply can result in material penalties or the non-renewal or termination of facility management contracts. In addition, changes in existing regulations could require us to substantially modify the manner in which we conduct our business
and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on us.  In addition, private prison managers are increasingly subject to
government legislation and regulation attempting to restrict the ability of private prison managers to house certain types of inmates, such as inmates from other jurisdictions or inmates at medium or higher security levels. Legislation has been
enacted in several states, and has previously been proposed in the United States House of Representatives, containing such restrictions. Although we do not believe that existing legislation will have a material adverse effect on us, future
legislation may have such an effect on us.  Governmental agencies may investigate and audit our contracts and, if any
improprieties are found, we may be required to refund amounts we have received, to forego anticipated revenues and we may be subject to penalties and sanctions, including prohibitions on our bidding in response to Requests for Proposals, or RFPs,
from governmental agencies to manage correctional facilities. Governmental agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them. As part of that process, governmental agencies may review our performance of
the contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. For contracts that actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency determines that we
have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, we may not be reimbursed for those costs, and we could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed. If we are found to have engaged in improper or illegal
activities, including under the United States False Claims Act, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension
or disqualification from doing business with certain governmental entities. An adverse determination in an action alleging improper or illegal activities by us could also adversely impact our ability to bid in response to RFPs in one or more
jurisdictions.  In addition to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our facility management contracts typically
have numerous requirements addressing all aspects of our operations which we may not be able to satisfy. For example, our contracts require us to maintain certain levels of coverage for general liability, workers

  38 


Table of Contents

compensation, vehicle liability, and property loss or damage. If we do not maintain the required categories and levels of coverage, the contracting governmental agency may be permitted to
terminate the contract. In addition, we are required under our contracts to indemnify the contracting governmental agency for all claims and costs arising out of our management of facilities and, in some instances, we are required to maintain
performance bonds relating to the construction, development and operation of facilities. Facility management contracts also typically include reporting requirements, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting
governmental agencies. Failure to properly adhere to the various terms of our customer contracts could expose us to liability for damages relating to any breaches as well as the loss of such contracts, which could materially adversely impact us.
 We may face community opposition to facility location, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts.
 Our success in obtaining new awards and contracts sometimes depends, in part, upon our ability to locate land that can
be leased or acquired, on economically favorable terms, by us or other entities working with us in conjunction with our proposal to construct and/or manage a facility. Some locations may be in or near populous areas and, therefore, may generate
legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site. When we select the intended project site, we attempt to conduct business in communities where local leaders and residents generally support the
establishment of a privatized correctional or detention facility. Future efforts to find suitable host communities may not be successful. In many cases, the site selection is made by the contracting governmental entity. In such cases, site selection
may be made for reasons related to political and/or economic development interests and may lead to the selection of sites that have less favorable environments.  Our business operations expose us to various liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance.  The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual
misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination
claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs,
electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental
agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we
carry no insurance. However, we generally have high deductible payment requirements on our primary insurance policies, including our general liability insurance, and there are also varying limits on the maximum amount of our overall coverage. As a
result, the insurance we maintain to cover the various liabilities to which we are exposed may not be adequate. Any losses relating to matters for which we are either uninsured or for which we do not have adequate insurance could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any losses relating to employment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
We may not be able to obtain or maintain the insurance levels required by our government contracts. 
Our government contracts require us to obtain and maintain specified insurance levels. The occurrence of any events specific to our
company or to our industry, or a general rise in insurance rates, could substantially increase our costs of obtaining or maintaining the levels of insurance required under our government contracts, or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining such
insurance altogether. If we are unable to obtain or maintain the required insurance levels, our ability to win new government contracts, renew government contracts that have 
  39 


Table of Contents

expired and retain existing government contracts could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our international operations expose us to risks which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.  For the year ended January 1, 2012, our international operations accounted for 13.4% of
our consolidated revenues from continuing operations. We face risks associated with our operations outside the United States. These risks include, among others, political and economic instability, exchange rate fluctuations, taxes, duties and the
laws or regulations in those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In the event that we experience any difficulties arising from our operations in foreign markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
adversely affected.  We conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures, which may lead to disagreements with
our joint venture partners and adversely affect our interest in the joint ventures.  We conduct our operations in South
Africa through our consolidated joint venture, South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited, which we refer to as SACM, and through our 50% owned joint venture South African Custodial Services Pty. Limited, referred to as SACS. We conduct our
prisoner escort and related custody services in the United Kingdom through our 50% unconsolidated joint venture in GEO Amey PECS Limited, which we refer to as GEOAmey. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Although we have the
majority vote in our consolidated joint venture, SACM, through our ownership of 62.5% of the voting shares, we share equal voting control on all significant matters to come before SACS. We also share equal voting control on all significant matters
to come before GEOAmey. These joint venture partners, as well as any future partners, may have interests that are different from ours which may result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business of the joint venture. In the event that we
have a disagreement with a joint venture partner as to the resolution of a particular issue to come before the joint venture, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the joint venture in general, we may not be able to resolve such
disagreement in our favor and such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in the joint venture or the business of the joint venture in general.  We are dependent upon our senior management and our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel.  We are dependent upon the continued service of each member of our senior management team, including George C. Zoley, Ph.D., our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Brian R. Evans, our Chief Financial
Officer, John M. Hurley, our Senior Vice President, Operations and President, U.S. Corrections & Detention, Jorge A. Dominicis, Senior Vice President Residential Treatment Services and President, GEO Care, Inc. and also our other five executive
officers at the Vice President level and above. The unexpected loss of Mr. Zoley, Mr. Evans or any other key member of our senior management team could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 In addition, the services we provide are labor-intensive. When we are awarded a facility management contract or open a new
facility, depending on the service we have been contracted to provide, we may need to hire operating management, correctional officers, security staff, physicians, nurses and other qualified personnel. The success of our business requires that we
attract, develop and retain these personnel. Our inability to hire sufficient qualified personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel at existing facilities could have a material effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.  Our profitability may be materially adversely affected by inflation.
 Many of our facility management contracts provide for fixed management fees or fees that increase by only small
amounts during their terms. While a substantial portion of our cost structure is generally fixed, if, due to 
  40 


Table of Contents

inflation or other causes, our operating expenses, such as costs relating to personnel, utilities, insurance, medical and food, increase at rates faster than increases, if any, in our facility
management fees, then our profitability could be materially adversely affected.  Various risks associated with the
ownership of real estate may increase costs, expose us to uninsured losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Our ownership of correctional and detention facilities subjects us to risks typically associated with investments in real estate. Investments in real estate, and in particular, correctional and detention
facilities, are relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to divest ourselves of one or more of our facilities promptly in response to changed conditions is limited. Investments in correctional and detention facilities, in particular, subject
us to risks involving potential exposure to environmental liability and uninsured loss. Our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as
the cost of complying with future legislation. In addition, although we maintain insurance for many types of losses, there are certain types of losses, such as losses from earthquakes, riots and acts of terrorism, which may be either uninsurable or
for which it may not be economically feasible to obtain insurance coverage, in light of the substantial costs associated with such insurance. As a result, we could lose both our capital invested in, and anticipated profits from, one or more of the
facilities we own. Further, even if we have insurance for a particular loss, we may experience losses that may exceed the limits of our coverage.  Risks related to facility construction and development activities may increase our costs related to such activities.  When we are engaged to perform construction and design services for a facility, we typically act as the primary contractor and subcontract with other companies who act as the general contractors. As
primary contractor, we are subject to the various risks associated with construction (including, without limitation, shortages of labor and materials, work stoppages, labor disputes and weather interference) which could cause construction delays. In
addition, we are subject to the risk that the general contractor will be unable to complete construction within the level of budgeted costs or be unable to fund any excess construction costs, even though we typically require general contractors to
post construction bonds and insurance. Under such contracts, we are ultimately liable for all late delivery penalties and cost overruns.  The rising cost and increasing difficulty of obtaining adequate levels of surety credit on favorable terms could adversely affect our operating results. 
We are often required to post performance bonds issued by a surety company as a condition to bidding on or being awarded a facility
development contract. Availability and pricing of these surety commitments is subject to general market and industry conditions, among other factors. Recent events in the economy have caused the surety market to become unsettled, causing many
reinsurers and sureties to reevaluate their commitment levels and required returns. As a result, surety bond premiums generally are increasing. If we are unable to effectively pass along the higher surety costs to our customers, any increase in
surety costs could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not continue to have access to surety credit or be able to secure bonds economically, without additional collateral, or at the levels required for any potential facility
development or contract bids. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of surety credit on favorable terms, we would have to rely upon letters of credit under our senior credit facility, which would entail higher costs even if such borrowing
capacity was available when desired, and our ability to bid for or obtain new contracts could be impaired.  We may not
be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions.  We have an active acquisition program, the
objective of which is to identify suitable acquisition targets that will enhance our growth. The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and
profitability. Even if we are able to identify such 
  41 


Table of Contents

candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities,
whether or not we consummate such acquisitions.  Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable
terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective
manner. The actual integration of any acquisition may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. We may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly,
successfully or on a timely basis. Any inability of management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may also assume liabilities
in connection with acquisitions that we would otherwise not be exposed to.  Adverse developments in our relationship
with our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  At
January 1, 2012, approximately 18% of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements and, as of such date, collective bargaining agreements with approximately 8% of our employees were set to expire in less than one year. While
only approximately 18% of our workforce schedule is covered by collective bargaining agreements, increases in organizational activity or any future work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results
of operations.  Technological change could cause our electronic monitoring products and technology to become obsolete or
require the redesign of our electronic monitoring products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Technological changes within the electronic monitoring business in which we conduct business may require us to expend substantial
resources in an effort to develop and/or utilize new electronic monitoring products and technology. We may not be able to anticipate or respond to technological changes in a timely manner, and our response may not result in successful electronic
monitoring product development and timely product introductions. If we are unable to anticipate or timely respond to technological changes, our business could be adversely affected and could compromise our competitive position, particularly if our
competitors announce or introduce new electronic monitoring products and services in advance of us. Additionally, new electronic monitoring products and technology face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors.
 Any negative changes in the level of acceptance of or resistance to the use of electronic monitoring products and
services by governmental customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Governmental customers use electronic monitoring products and services to monitor low risk offenders as a way to help reduce overcrowding in correctional facilities, as a monitoring and sanctioning tool,
and to promote public safety by imposing restrictions on movement and serving as a deterrent for alcohol usage. If the level of acceptance of or resistance to the use of electronic monitoring products and services by governmental customers were to
change over time in a negative manner so that governmental customers decide to decrease their usage levels and contracting for electronic monitoring products and services, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply quality
infrastructure components for its electronic monitoring products. If our suppliers cannot provide the components or services we require and with such quality as we expect, our ability to market and sell our electronic monitoring products and
services could be harmed.  If our suppliers fail to supply components in a timely manner that meets our quantity,
quality, cost requirements, or technical specifications, we may not be able to access alternative sources of these components within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates. A reduction or interruption in the supply of
components, or a significant increase in the price of components, could have a material adverse effect on our marketing and sales initiatives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
Providing electronic monitoring services is a new line of business for us and as a result we are subject to all of the risks and
uncertainties of developing a new line of business.  Prior to our acquisition of BI, we had never provided electronic
monitoring services and had no prior experience in the electronic monitoring services industry. As a result of our acquisition of BI, we entered into a new line of business. Our success providing electronic monitoring services will be subject to all
of the uncertainties regarding the development of a new business. There can be no assurance regarding the continued acceptance of electronic monitoring services by our customers. Additionally, we may experience difficulties keeping ahead of or
reacting to technological changes in the electronic monitoring services industry as well as reacting to other challenges of the electronic monitoring services industry due to our lack of experience in this industry. 
The interruption, delay or failure of the provision of our services or information systems could adversely affect our business.
 Certain segments of our business depend significantly on effective information systems. As with all companies that
utilize information technology, we are vulnerable to negative impacts if information is inadvertently interrupted, delayed, compromised or lost. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our clients. The interruption, delay
or failure of our information systems or loss of client data could cost us both monetarily and in terms of client good will, lost business, disruption of business, adverse impacts to our results of operations and exposure to the risks of litigation.
Such interruptions, delays or failures could damage our brand and reputation. Prior to our acquisition of BI, BI experienced such an issue in October 2010 with one of its offender monitoring servers that caused the servers automatic
notification system to be temporarily disabled resulting in delayed notifications to customers when a database exceeded its data storage capacity. The issue was resolved within approximately 12 hours. We continually work to update and maintain
effective information systems however, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a future interruption, delay or failure of our services, information systems or loss of client data that would adversely impact our business. 
An inability to acquire, protect or maintain our intellectual property and patents in the electronic monitoring space could harm
our ability to compete or grow.  We have numerous United States and foreign patents issued as well as a number of
United States patents pending in the electronic monitoring space. There can be no assurance that the protection afforded by these patents will provide us with a competitive advantage, prevent our competitors from duplicating our products, or that we
will be able to assert our intellectual property rights in infringement actions.  In addition, any of our patents may be
challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful should one or more of our patents be challenged for any reason. If our patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable, or
narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded to our products could be impaired, which could significantly impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position and harm our business and operating results.

  43 


Table of Contents
There can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications held by us will
result in an issued patent, or that if patents are issued to us, that such patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its
enforceability. The United States federal courts or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Our patents and patent
applications cover particular aspects of our products. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. If these developments were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our sales. We
may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees and current employees, despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and
other contractual restrictions. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately
protected, we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share that would harm our business and operating
results.  Additionally, the expiration of any of our patents may reduce the barriers to entry into our electronic monitoring
line of business and may result in loss of market share and a decrease in our competitive abilities, thus having a potential adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Our electronic monitoring products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to litigation that
could itself be costly, could result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, and/or prevent us from using technology that is essential to our products.  There can be no assurance that our current products or products under development will not infringe any patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If infringement claims are brought
against us, whether successfully or not, these assertions could distract management from other tasks important to the success of our business, necessitate us expending potentially significant funds and resources to defend or settle such claims and
harm our reputation. We cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources to defend ourselves against any patent or other intellectual property litigation.  In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:   


 

 
 cease selling or using any products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;
  


 

 
 pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property; 
 


 

 
 obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or
  


 

 
 redesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not
be possible and could be costly and time-consuming if it is possible to do.  In the event of an adverse
determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or our failure to license essential technology, our sales could be harmed and/or our costs could be increased, which would harm our financial condition. 
  44 


Table of Contents
We license intellectual property rights in the electronic monitoring space, including
patents, from third party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the intellectual property underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed. Our licensors may also seek to terminate our
license.  We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is
necessary or useful to our business. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce our licensed intellectual property. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute any applications for or maintain
intellectual property to which we have licenses, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing such intellectual property, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the
intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer similar products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. 
If we lose any of our right to use third-party intellectual property, it could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our
technologies, products or services, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects.  We
may be subject to costly product liability claims from the use of our electronic monitoring products, which could damage our reputation, impair the marketability of our products and services and force us to pay costs and damages that may not be
covered by adequate insurance.  Manufacturing, marketing, selling, testing and the operation of our electronic
monitoring products and services entail a risk of product liability. We could be subject to product liability claims to the extent our electronic monitoring products fail to perform as intended. Even unsuccessful claims against us could result in
the expenditure of funds in litigation, the diversion of management time and resources, damage to our reputation and impairment in the marketability of our electronic monitoring products and services. While we maintain liability insurance, it is
possible that a successful claim could be made against us, that the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim, or that damages payable by us would harm our business.
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock  Fluctuations in the stock market as well as general economic, market and industry conditions may harm the market price of our common stock. 
The market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuation. The market price of our common stock may continue to be
subject to significant fluctuations in response to operating results and other factors, including:   


 

 
 actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, particularly if they differ from investors expectations;
  


 

 
 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; 
 


 

 
 general economic, market and political conditions, including war or acts of terrorism, not related to our business; 
 


 

 
 actions of our competitors and changes in the market valuations, strategy and capability of our competitors; 
 


 

 
 our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and consolidations; and 
 


 

 
 changes in the prospects of the privatized corrections and detention industry. 
In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results. 
  45 


Table of Contents
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock that we may issue and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  Future
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future
offerings of equity or equity-related securities. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock.
 Various anti-takeover protections applicable to us may make an acquisition of us more difficult and reduce the market
value of our common stock.  We are a Florida corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Florida law impose various
impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, provisions of our articles of incorporation may make an acquisition of us more
difficult. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance by our Board of Directors of blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval. Such shares of preferred stock could be given voting rights, dividend rights,
liquidation rights or other similar rights superior to those of our common stock, making a takeover of us more difficult and expensive. We also have adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill, which could result
in the significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of any person that engages in an unsolicited attempt to take over our company and, accordingly, could discourage potential acquirers. In addition to discouraging takeovers, the anti-takeover
provisions of Florida law and our articles of incorporation, as well as our shareholder rights plan, may have the impact of reducing the market value of our common stock.  Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common
stock.  If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, in accordance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, our exposure to fraud and errors in accounting and financial reporting could materially increase. Also, inadequate
internal controls would likely prevent us from concluding on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such failure to achieve and
maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our business and the price of our common stock.  We may
issue additional debt securities that could limit our operating flexibility and negatively affect the value of our common stock.  In the future, we may issue additional debt securities which may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants that could place restrictions on the operation of our business and the
execution of our business strategy in addition to the restrictions on our business already contained in the agreements governing our existing debt. In addition, we may choose to issue debt that is convertible or exchangeable for other securities,
including our common stock, or that has rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Because any decision to issue debt securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate
the amount, timing or nature of any future debt financings and we may be required to accept unfavorable terms for any such financings. Accordingly, any future issuance of debt could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock and reduce the
value of our common stock.

Although the Board has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly
dividends on our common stock beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we cannot assure the amount of dividends, if any, that may be paid in the future.  Our Board determined in February 2012 to adopt a dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, we anticipate that we will pay quarterly dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of
$.10 per share for a total of $.40 per share in annual dividends, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board that cash dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and our
agreements applicable to the declaration of cash dividends, including our indentures and Senior Credit Facility. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 or how long we will continue to
declare dividends after the fourth quarter of 2012. The declaration of dividends in the future may be affected by, among other factors:   


 

 
 our views on potential future capital requirements;   


 

 
 use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions; 
 


 

 
 stock repurchase programs;   


 

 
 changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and 
 


 

 
 changes to our business model.  If we determine in the future to reduce the amount of any quarterly dividend payments or suspend the payment of quarterly dividends, this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.
 Our stock repurchase program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. 
As of January 1, 2012, $25.0 million remains available under the current stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made in the
open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, from time to time, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including the limitations set forth in our indentures and Senior Credit Facility.
There can be no assurance that we will buy additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share. Important factors that could
cause us to discontinue or decrease our share repurchases include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time, the
rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program, and the availability of funds necessary to
continue purchasing stock. If we curtail our repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected.

Properties  
Our corporate offices are located in Boca Raton, Florida, under a lease agreement which was amended in October 2011. The current lease
expires March 2020 and has two 5-year renewal options, which if exercised will result in a maximum term ending March 2030. In addition, we lease office space for our eastern regional office in Charlotte, North Carolina; our central regional office
in San Antonio, Texas; our western regional office in Los Angeles, California; and our youth services division in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a result of the BI acquisition in February 2011, we are also currently leasing office space in
Boulder, Colorado. We also lease office space in Sydney, Australia, in Sandton, South Africa, and in Berkshire, England, through our overseas affiliates to support our Australian, South African, and UK operations, respectively. We consider our
office space adequate for our current operations.

Item 3.
Legal Proceedings  On June 22, 2011, a jury verdict for $6.5 million was returned against GEO in a wrongful death action brought by the Personal Representative of the Estate of Ronald Sites, a former inmate at our
Lawton Oklahoma Correctional Facility. On August 22, 2011, the court entered judgment against GEO in the amount of $8.4 million, which includes pre judgment interest on the amount of the verdict from January 26, 2007, the date of the
filing of the lawsuit, through the date of the jury verdict. The lawsuit, Ronald L. Sites, as the administrator of the Estate of Ronald S. Sites, deceased v. The GEO Group, Inc. was filed on January 28, 2007 in the District Court of Comanche
County, State of Oklahoma, Case No. CJ-2007-84. It was alleged that on January 29, 2005, Mr. Sites was harmed by his cellmate as a result of our negligence. We disagree with the judgment and are pursuing an appeal. A supersedeas bond in
the amount of $10.0 million was posted on August 29, 2011 by the insurance company of the State of Pennsylvania. We intend to vigorously defend our rights and believe our accrual relative to this judgment is adequate. Under our insurance plan,
we are responsible for the first $3.0 million of liability. Aside from this amount, which we would pay directly from general corporate funds, we believe we have insurance coverage for this matter. 
In June 2004, we received notice of a third-party claim for property damage incurred during 2001 and 2002 at several detention facilities
formerly operated by our Australian subsidiary. The claim relates to property damage caused by detainees at the detention facilities. The notice was given by the Australian governments insurance provider and did not specify the amount of
damages being sought. In August 2007, a lawsuit (Commonwealth of Australia v. Australasian Correctional Services PTY, Limited No. SC 656) was filed against us in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory seeking damages of up to
approximately AUD 18 million or $18.4 million based on exchange rates as of January 1, 2012, plus interest. We believe that we have several defenses to the allegations underlying the litigation and the amounts sought and intend to
vigorously defend our rights with respect to this matter. We have established a reserve based on our estimate of the most probable loss based on the facts and circumstances known to date and the advice of legal counsel in connection with this
matter. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on information known to date and our preliminary review of the claim and related reserve for loss, we believe that, if settled unfavorably, this matter could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are uninsured for any damages or costs that we may incur as a result of this claim, including the expenses of defending the claim. 
Our South Africa joint venture had been in discussions with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with respect to the
deductibility of certain expenses for the tax periods 2002 through 2004. The joint venture operates the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Centre and accepted inmates from the South African Department of Correctional Services in 2002. During 2009, SARS
notified us that it proposed to disallow these deductions. We appealed these proposed disallowed deductions with SARS and in October 2010 received a favorable Tax Court ruling relative to these deductions, which was subsequently appealed by SARS.
The Court of Appeals ruled on November 30, 2011 that the disputed expenses are deductible.  We are a participant in the
IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) for the 2011 fiscal year. Under the IRS CAP transactions that meet certain materiality thresholds are reviewed on a real-time basis shortly after their completion. Additionally, all transactions
that are part of certain IRS tier and similar initiatives are audited regardless of their materiality. The program also provides for the audit of transition years that have not previously been audited. The IRS will be reviewing our 2009 and 2010
years as transition years.

During the first quarter of 2011, following our acquisition of BI, BI received notice from
the IRS that it will audit its 2008 tax year. The audit was completed on October 7, 2011 with no change.  The nature of
our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical
malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property
loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners,
including damages arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. Except as otherwise disclosed above, we do not expect the outcome of any pending claims or legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 On July 14, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up
to $100.0 million of our common stock effective through December 31, 2012. The stock repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow, and borrowings under our Revolver. The stock repurchase program is intended to
be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements. The program may also include repurchases from time to time
from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and/or vested stock options. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any specific amount of our common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at our
discretion. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, we purchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $75.0 million primarily purchased with proceeds from our Revolver.

On July 14, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $100 million of its common stock effective
through December 31, 2012. The stock repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow, and borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented
through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements. The program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive
officers or directors of vested restricted stock and/or vested stock options.

All shares purchased to date pursuant to the Companys share repurchase program have been deposited into treasury and retained for future uses.
 We did not pay any cash dividends on our common stock for fiscal years 2011 and 2010. In February 2012, our
Board determined to adopt a dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, we anticipate that we will pay quarterly dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of $.10 per share per quarter, or $.40 per share for the year. The
amount and timing of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future earnings, our

capital requirements, our financial condition and on such other factors as our Board of Directors may take into consideration. In addition to these factors, the indenture governing our 7 3/4% Senior Notes, the indenture governing our
6.625% Senior Notes and our Senior Credit Facility also place material restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14-Debt in Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further description of these restrictions. We believe we have the ability to continue to fund the
stock repurchase program, our working capital, our debt service requirements, and our maintenance and growth capital expenditure requirements, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for other corporate purposes.

In the future, the peer group against which the performance of our common stock is compared will no longer include Wilshire 5000 Equity. We will replace this index with
Russell 2000 as we have determined the performance of the small cap companies included in the Russell 2000 index are a better performance benchmark and provide a better comparison to our Company than the Wilshire 5000 Equity Index. The Russell 2000
Index measures the performance of small cap companies in the U.S. whereas the Wilshire 5000 Index measures the performance of most publicly traded companies (small cap, mid cap and large cap), except Bulletin Board/penny stock and stocks of
extremely small companies.Our common stock is a member of the Russell 2000.

Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
Introduction  The
following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, those described above under Item 1A.
Risk Factors, and Forward-Looking Statements  Safe Harbor below. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  52 


Table of Contents
We are a leading provider of government-outsourced services specializing in the management
of correctional, detention, mental health, residential treatment and re-entry facilities, and the provision of community based services and youth services in the United States, Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Canada. We operate
a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum, medium and minimum security prisons, immigration detention centers, minimum security detention centers, mental health, residential treatment and community based re-entry
facilities. We offer counseling, education and/ or treatment to inmates with alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities we manage. As of January 1, 2012, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership
of approximately 79,400 beds at 115 correctional, detention and residential treatment facilities, including idle facilities and projects under development, and also included the provision of monitoring approximately 70,000 offenders in a
community-based environment on behalf of approximately 900 federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states. Our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security, administrative, rehabilitation,
education, health and food services, primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities. Our mental health and residential treatment services are operated by our GEO Care business segment and involve working with governments to deliver
quality care, innovative programming and active patient treatment primarily in privately operated state mental health care facilities. Our community-based services, operated through our GEO Care business segment, involve supervision of adult
parolees and probationers and the provision of temporary housing, programming, employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community. Our youth services division, operated through
the GEO Care business segment, include residential, detention and shelter care and community based services along with rehabilitative, educational and treatment programs. Our monitoring services, operated through the GEO Care business segment,
provide our governmental clients with innovative compliance technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; including
services to ICE for the provision of services designed to improve the participation of non-detained aliens in the immigration court system. We develop new facilities, using our project development experience to design, construct and finance what we
believe are state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency. We also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically, and in the United Kingdom, our joint venture GEOAmey is
responsible for providing prisoner escort and custody services in the United Kingdom, including all of Wales and all of England except London and East of England. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, we had consolidated revenues of
$1.6 billion and we maintained an average companywide facility occupancy rate of 94.6%, excluding facilities that are either idle or under development.  Critical Accounting Policies  We believe that the accounting policies
described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have
discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board of Directors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Our consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the
information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We routinely evaluate
our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual
results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. 
  53 


Table of Contents
Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than
those discussed below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction
with this discussion.  Revenue Recognition 
Facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government
appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate. A limited number of our contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets. Revenue
based on the performance of certain targets is less than 1% of our consolidated annual revenues. These performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time. Such criteria includes our ability to achieve certain
contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service we provide, non-occurrence of certain disruptive events, effectiveness of our quality control programs and our responsiveness to customer requirements and concerns. For the limited number of
contracts where revenue is based on the performance of certain targets, revenue is either (i) recorded pro rata when revenue is fixed and determinable or (ii) recorded when the specified time period lapses. In many instances, we are a
party to more than one contract with a single entity. In these instances, each contract is accounted for separately. We have not recorded any revenue that is at risk due to future performance contingencies. 
Construction revenues are recognized from our contracts with certain customers to perform construction and design services (project
development services) for various facilities. In these instances, we act as the primary developer and subcontract with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors. These construction revenues are recognized as earned on a
percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the
period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable. Typically, we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place. Costs attributable to unapproved change orders are
expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. If we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change
in the contract price, costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs incurred. Revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved
change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements, may result in
revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. As the primary contractor, we are exposed to the various risks associated with construction, including the risk of cost overruns.
Accordingly, we record our construction revenue on a gross basis and include the related cost of construction activities in Operating Expenses.  When evaluating multiple element arrangements for certain contracts where we provide project development services to our clients in addition to standard management services, we follow revenue recognition
guidance for multiple element arrangements. This revenue recognition guidance related to multiple deliverables in an arrangement provides guidance on determining if separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement
involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units, how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. In instances where we provide
these project development services and subsequent management services, generally, the arrangement results in no delivered elements at the onset of the agreement. The elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and
management services are performed. Project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 we implemented ASU No. 2009-13 which provides amendments
to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements. The implementation of this standard in the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on our

  54 


Table of Contents

financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The amendments, among other things, establish the selling price of a deliverable, replace the term fair value with selling price and
eliminate the residual method such that consideration can be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method based on GEOs specific assumptions. As a result of the BI Acquisition, we also periodically sell our monitoring
equipment and other services together in multiple-element arrangements. In such cases, we allocate revenue on the basis of the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered elements. The selling price for each of the elements is estimated
based on the price we charge when the elements are sold on a stand alone basis.  Reserves for Insurance Losses
 The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to,
civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims
relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for
personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In
addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance
coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It
is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale.  We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $67.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of U.S. Corrections &
Detention, GEO Cares community based services, GEO Cares youth services and BI. In addition, GEO Cares residential treatment services division has a separate claims-made liability insurance program for their mental health
facilities with a specific loss limit of $35.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. That same $35.0 million limit also applies to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services. We are uninsured for any
claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers compensation, environmental liability and automobile liability. 
For most casualty insurance policies, we carry substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $3.0 million per
occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in
Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial
availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure, mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest, may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value.
 With respect to our operations in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia, we utilize a combination of
locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the Company. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a
discontinued contract.  Of the reserves discussed above, our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers
compensation and general liability claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $45.3 million and $40.2 million as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively. We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate
amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our

  55 


Table of Contents

facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be
impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the
estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies,
the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be materially adversely impacted.  Income Taxes 
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or
liabilities from year to year. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate, estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable
income. Additionally, we must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. If actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets
or liabilities may be required, which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our operations and our effective tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not
criteria. Management has not made any significant changes to the way we account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements. Based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable
earnings history, management currently expects full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances. Furthermore, tax positions taken by us may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. In
determining the adequacy of our provision (benefit) for income taxes, potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed. As such, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or
the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. To the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/decreases by 1% of income before income taxes, equity in earnings of affiliate,
discontinued operations, and consolidated income from continuing operations would have decreased/increased by $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011
and January 3, 2010.  Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 2 to 50 years. Equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used
for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. We perform ongoing assessments of the estimated useful lives of the property and
equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the assessment indicates that assets will be used for a
longer or shorter period than previously anticipated, the useful lives of the assets are revised, resulting in a change in estimate. In our first fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2010, we completed a depreciation study on our owned correctional
facilities. Based on the results of the depreciation study, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our buildings from our historical estimate of 40 years to a revised estimate of 50 years, effective January 4, 2010.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized in connection with facility construction. Capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the assets estimated useful
life. 
  56 


Table of Contents
We review long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long-lived assets, or when other changes
occur that might impair recovery of long-lived assets such as the termination of a management contract. If impairment indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test to determine whether or not an impairment loss should be measured.
Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. For the purposes of the recoverability test, if a long-lived asset is part of
a group that includes other assets, the unit of accounting for the long-lived asset is its group. Generally, we group our assets by facility for the purposes of considering whether any impairment exists. When considering the future cash flows of a
facility, we make assumptions based on historical experience with our customers, current data related to the pricing of our management contracts, residual value of our facilities, and/or terminal growth rates. While these estimates do not generally
have a material impact on the impairment charges associated with managed-only facilities, the sensitivity increases significantly when considering the impairment on facilities that are either owned or leased by us due to the investment we make in
buildings and improvements for owned and leased facilities. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management
expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.  Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements 
The following accounting standards have an implementation date subsequent to the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 and as such, have
not yet been adopted by us during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012:  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2011-04 which provides a consistent definition of fair value in US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and ensures that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the
same (except for minor differences in wording and style). The amendments change certain fair value measurement principles and enhance the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. The standard will become effective
for us during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. We do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operation and cash flows.  In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
No. 2011-05 which requires an entity to present all nonowner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option
to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. This standard will become effective for us in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. We do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 in order to defer only those changes in Update 2011-05 that relate to the
presentation of reclassification adjustments. No other requirements in ASU 2011-05 were affected by this Update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but
consecutive financial statements. ASU 2011-12 is effective for us in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact
on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.  Results of Operations 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements accompanying this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those 
  57 


Table of Contents

anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and those included in
other portions of this report.  The discussion of our results of operations below excludes the results of discontinued
operations reported in 2009. Also, as a result of the acquisition of Cornell, managements review of certain segment financial data was revised with regards to the Bronx Community Re-entry Center and the Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center.
These facilities now report within the GEO Care segment and are no longer included with U.S. Corrections & Detention. Disclosures for business segments reflect these reclassifications for all periods presented. 
For the purposes of the discussion below, 2011 means the 52 weeks fiscal year ended January 1, 2012,
2010 means the 52 week fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, and 2009 means the 53 weeks fiscal year ended January 3, 2010. Our fiscal quarters in the fiscal years discussed below are referred to as

 U.S. Corrections & Detention  The increase in revenues for U.S. Corrections & Detention in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to several factors including primarily: (i) aggregate increases in revenues of $30.5 million from
Blackwater River Correctional Facility (Blackwater River) located in Milton, Florida which we completed the construction and began intake of inmates in October 2010, Indiana Short Term Offender Program (STOP) in Plainfield,
Indiana which began operations in March 2011, and Adelanto Processing Center East (Adelanto East) which began operations in August 2011; (ii) an increase of revenue of $43.1 million due to the October 2010 activation of D. Ray James
Correctional Facility (D. Ray James) located in Folkston, Georgia; (iii) aggregate increases of $9.4 million at Maverick County Detention Facility (Maverick) located in Maverick, Texas, LaSalle Detention Facility
(LaSalle) located in Jena, Louisiana and Val Verde Correctional Facility (Val Verde) located in Del Rio, Texas due to increases in population; (iv) aggregate increases of $6.9 million due to population increases and/ or
changes in contractual rates at Western Region Detention Facility (Western Region) located in San Diego, California, Aurora ICE Processing Center (Aurora) located in Aurora, Colorado and South Texas Detention Complex
(STDC) located in Pearsall, Texas; (v) an increase of $2.4 million in revenues due to the opening of North Lake Correctional Facility (North Lake) locate in Baldwin, Michigan which began operations in May 2011 and was
terminated effective October 2011; and (vi) aggregate net increases due to a full year of operations at other facilities acquired from Cornell of $86.6 million. These increases were partially offset by aggregate decreases of
$46.8 million due to our terminated contracts.  The number of compensated mandays in U.S. Corrections &
Detention facilities increased by 2.2 million to 17.3 million mandays in 2011 from 15.1 million mandays in 2010. We experienced an increase of 1.5 million mandays due to the activations of Blackwater River, D. Ray James and STOP;
a net increase of 1.6 million mandays due to the full year of operations at other facilities acquired from Cornell and net increases of 0.3 million mandays at the remaining facilities. These increases were offset by a decrease of
1.2 million mandays

related to the terminated contracts previously discussed. We look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds. The average occupancy is
calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity, excluding idle facilities. The average occupancy in our U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities was 94.8% of capacity in 2011, excluding idle facilities. The average
occupancy in our U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities was 93.8% in 2010 excluding idle facilities.  GEO Care
 The increase in revenues for GEO Care in 2011 compared to 2010 is attributable to several factors: (i) increases
in revenue of $10.4 million due to the opening of the 100-bed Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility (Montgomery County) located in Conroe, Texas in March 2011; (ii) aggregate net increases of $93.1 million due to the
facilities acquired from Cornell in August 2010; and (iii) an increase in revenues due to our acquisition of BI for monitoring services, which contributed an increase of $86.9 million, and for services provided at our Day Reporting Centers,
which contributed $26.3 million in additional revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million due to the termination of our management contract at Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center in July 2011. 
The number of compensated residential mandays for GEO Care increased by 0.7 million to 1.9 million residential mandays in 2011
from 1.2 million residential mandays in 2010 primarily due to the full year of operations at the facilities acquired from Cornell. The average occupancy at our GEO Care facilities was 86.7% of capacity in 2011, excluding idle facilities and
excluding the non-residential services provided at our youth services facilities. The average occupancy at our GEO Care residential facilities was 89.0% in 2010, excluding idle facilities. The decline in average occupancy is a result of the
community-based and youth services facilities we acquired from Cornell which are occupancy sensitive.  International
Services  Revenues for our International Services segment increased significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 due to
several factors. We experienced an increase in revenues of $19.3 million due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates primarily between the Australian dollar and the US dollar. Our Australian subsidiary experienced aggregate increases of $5.7
million due to population increases, contractual increases related to the inflationary index and to additional services provided under its management contracts. Our subsidiary in South Africa experienced increases of $1.9 million primarily due to
increases in the inflationary index. During 2011, our subsidiary in the United Kingdom experienced aggregate increases of $5.0 million due to: (i) the commencement of operations at the 217-bed Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre
(Dungavel) located near Glasgow, Scotland, (ii) the full year of operations of the 360-bed expansion at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre (Harmondsworth) located in London, England; and (iii) contractual
increases and additional services provided at Harmondsworth. These increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of $6.7 million in revenues due to the termination of the management contracts for the operation of Campsfield House
Immigration Removal Centre (Campsfield House) and Melbourne Custody Centre (Melbourne). 
Facility Construction & Design  The decrease in revenues from the Facility Construction & Design segment of $23.1 million in 2011 is primarily due to the completion of Blackwater River which was completed in October 2010 and
activated on October 5, 2010.

 Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our
correctional, detention and mental health and GEO Care facilities and expenses incurred in our Facility Construction & Design segment.  U.S. Corrections & Detention  The increase in operating expenses
for U.S. Corrections & Detention is due to several factors including primarily: (i) aggregate increases of $53.0 million in operating expenses due to the activation of the management contracts at Blackwater River, D. Ray James, STOP
and Adelanto East; (ii) operating expenses of $2.5 million related to start-up costs for the Riverbend Correctional Facility (Riverbend) located in Milledgeville, Georgia which was activated in December 2011; (iii) increases of
$20.4 million as a result of certain of our facilities mentioned above experiencing increases related to population and additional services provided under contract modifications; (iv) operating expenses at North Lake of $8.3 million; and
(v) remaining net increases in operating expenses of $39.1 million due to the full year of operations at various facilities we acquired from Cornell offset by decreases in nonrecurring start-up costs and acquisition related costs incurred in
2010. These increases were partially offset by aggregate decreases in expenses of approximately $25.5 million as a result of terminated contracts.  GEO Care  Operating expenses increased by $146.8 million in
2011 compared to 2010 due to several factors including the operation of Montgomery County and the acquisition of BI which contributed an aggregate increase of $82.5 million, and the full year of operations at the facilities we acquired from Cornell
in August of 2010 which contributed approximately $64.3 million of the increase. During 2011, we experienced a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue due to improved margins resulting from the acquisitions of Cornell in August
2010 and BI in February 2011.  International Services 
Expenses increased at our international subsidiaries consistent with the revenue increases and are consistent as a percentage of segment
revenues. Operating expenses increased by $17.7 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Australian subsidiary experienced aggregate increases in operating expenses of $3.6 million as a result of population increases and
additional services provided under certain contracts. Our subsidiary in the United Kingdom experienced a combined increase of $5.4 million in operating expenses as a result of increased populations related to the 360-bed Harmondsworth expansion and
the commencement of operations at Dungavel in September 2011. Our South Africa subsidiary also experienced an increase in operating expenses of $1.1 million related to increases in the inflationary index. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in operating expenses of $5.7 million associated with the terminated contracts at Campsfield House and Melbourne.

 U.S. Corrections & Detention 
U.S. Corrections & Detention depreciation and amortization expense increased by $15.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010. As a
result of our acquisition of Cornell in August 2010, we experienced increases in depreciation and amortization expense of $9.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. In addition, we completed construction projects at Broward, North Lake, Aurora,
Adelanto East, and Central Texas Detention Facility (Central Texas) located in San Antonio, Texas, which increased depreciation by $3.1 million. The remaining increase is primarily driven by the activation of Riverbend in December 2011
which resulted in additional depreciation expense of $0.4 million.  GEO Care 
The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for GEO Care of $20.9 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 is
primarily due to our acquisitions of BI and Cornell which contributed increases to depreciation and amortization expense of $15.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively.  International Services  Overall, depreciation and amortization
expense increased slightly in fiscal year 2011 over fiscal year 2010 due to additional capital expenditures in Australia, the Harmondsworth expansion, and also from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.

 General and administrative expenses comprise substantially all of our other unallocated operating
expenses primarily including corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other administrative expenses. These expenses increased significantly in 2010 due to nonrecurring acquisition related costs of approximately $25 million
related to the acquisitions of Cornell and BI. In 2011, we incurred $6.3 million in nonrecurring charges related to these acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the nonrecurring charges, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue
in 2011 would have been 6.7% of revenues. In 2010, excluding the impact of the $25 million in nonrecurring acquisition related costs, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2010 would have been 6.4%. Acquisition related
costs consisted primarily of advisory, legal, and bank fees.

 The majority of our interest income generated in 2011 and 2010 is from the cash balances at our
Australian subsidiary. The increase in the current period over the same period last year is mainly attributable to currency exchange rates and to higher average cash balances.  The increase in interest expense of $34.7 million is primarily attributable to more indebtedness outstanding in 2011 compared to 2010. We experienced increases in interest expense as a result of:
(i) higher outstanding average borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility which resulted in increases to interest expense of $11.5 million; (ii) an increase of $18.3 million related to our 6.625% Senior Notes, which were issued in
February 2011; (iii) less capitalized interest which increased interest expense in 2011 by $1.1 million; and (iv) an increase of $4.1 million, net of amortization of premium, in interest expense related to the non-recourse debt of
MCF. Capitalized interest was $3.1 million and $4.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Total consolidated indebtedness at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, excluding non-recourse debt and capital lease liabilities, was
$1,338.4 million and $807.8 million, respectively.  We have interest rate swap agreements with
respect to a notional amount of $100.0 million of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes which resulted in a savings in interest expense of $3.1 million and $3.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively.

 The effective tax rate during 2011 was 38.7%, compared to 40.3% in 2010. The effective tax rate in 2011 reflects foreign
nonrecurring start-up expenses related to GEOAmey. In the absence of such nonrecurring expenses, the effective tax rate for 2011 would have been 38.2%. The effective tax rate in 2010 included nondeductible transaction costs related to the BI
acquisition and a benefit due to a $2.3 million decrease in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits.  Equity in Earnings of Affiliate

 Equity in earnings of affiliates, presented net of income taxes, represent the earnings of SACS and
GEOAmey. The overall decrease in equity in earnings of affiliate was due to a decrease in the net earnings of SACS in 2011 compared to 2010 due to additional taxes on dividend distributions and a loss at GEOAmey, our newly created joint venture in
the United Kingdom. The dividend distributions from SACS were $9.9 million in 2011 compared to $3.9 million in 2010.

 U.S. Corrections & Detention  The increase in revenues for U.S. Corrections & Detention in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the acquisition of Cornell in August 2010 which contributed additional revenues of
$85.5 million. Increases at other facilities in 2010 included: (i) $7.2 million from Blackwater River Correctional Facility located in Milton, Florida which we completed the construction and began intake of inmates in October 2010;
and (ii) an aggregate increase of $13.3 million due to pre diem rate increases and increases in population. These increases were offset by: (i) an aggregate decrease of $9.1 million due to modest per diem reductions and lower
populations at certain facilities; (ii) an aggregate decrease of $29.7 million due to our terminated contracts at the McFarland Community Correctional Facility (McFarland) in McFarland, California, Moore Haven Correctional
Facility (Moore Haven) in Moore Haven, Florida, the Jefferson County Downtown Jail (Jefferson County) in Beaumont, Texas, Newton County Correctional Center (Newton County) in Newton, Texas, Graceville Correctional
Facility (Graceville) in Graceville, Florida, South Texas Intermediate Sanction Facility (South Texas ISF) in Houston, Texas and Bridgeport Correctional Center (Bridgeport) in Bridgeport, Texas. 
The number of compensated mandays in U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities increased by 0.7 million to 15.1 million
mandays in 2010 from 14.4 million mandays in 2009 due to the acquisition of Cornell which resulted in an additional 1.4 million mandays. This increase in mandays was offset by a net decrease of 0.8 million mandays related to the
terminated contracts previously discussed. We look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds. The average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity. The
average occupancy in our U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities was 93.8% of capacity in 2010, excluding idle facilities. The average occupancy in our U.S. Corrections & Detention facilities was 93.6% in 2009 excluding idle
facilities and taking into account the reclassification of our Bronx Community Re-entry Center and our Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center to GEO Care during 2010.  GEO Care  The increase in revenues for GEO Care in 2010 compared to
2009 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Cornell in August 2010, which contributed $65.7 million in additional revenues. Additionally, revenues from our operation of the Columbia Regional Care Center in Columbia, South Carolina, as
a result of our acquisition of Just Care, Inc., which we refer to as Just Care, in September 2009, contributed an increase of $17.8 million compared to 2009. These increases were offset by aggregate decreases of $2.7 million at other GEO
Care Residential Treatment Services facilities. These decreases were primarily the result of lower per diem rates and lower average daily populations. In Fourth Quarter 2010, we reclassified the Bronx Community Re-entry Center and Brooklyn Community
Re-entry Center from U.S. Corrections & Detention to GEO Care. The segment data has been revised for all periods presented to reflect the approach used by management to evaluate the performance of the business.

Table of Contents
The number of compensated mandays for GEO Care increased by 0.5 million to
1.2 million mandays in 2010 from 0.7 million mandays in 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of Cornell. The average occupancy at our GEO Care facilities was 89.0% of capacity in 2010, excluding idle facilities, excluding the
non-residential services provided at our youth services facilities and taking into account the reclassification of our Bronx Community Re-entry Center and our Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center. The average occupancy at our GEO Care facilities was
95.7% in 2009. The decline in average occupancy is a result of the Cornell acquisition. We added 21 community-based facilities and 17 youth services facilities which are occupancy sensitive. In 2009, the residential treatment facilities were
primarily fixed fee arrangements.  International Services 
Revenues for our International Services segment during 2010 increased significantly due to several factors. Our new management contract
for the operation of the Parklea Correctional Centre in Sydney, Australia (Parklea) which started in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 contributed an increase in revenues for fiscal year 2010 of $21.9 million. Our contract for the
management of Harmondsworth experienced an increase in revenues of $11.4 million due to the activation of the 360-bed expansion in July 2010. In addition, we experienced increases at other international facilities due to contractual increases
linked to the inflationary index at some facilities and additional services provided at other facilities. In the aggregate, these increases contributed revenues of $2.6 million in fiscal year 2010. We also experienced an increase in revenues of
$21.3 million during fiscal year 2010 due to the fluctuation of foreign currencies. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $3.7 million related to our terminated contract for the operation of the Melbourne
Custody Centre in Melbourne, Australia.  Facility Construction & Design 
The decrease in revenues from the Facility Construction & Design segment in 2010 is primarily due to a decrease in construction
activities at Blackwater River Correctional Facility in Milton, Florida which resulted in a decrease in revenues of $68.3 million. The Blackwater River Correctional Facility construction was completed in October 2010 and we began intake of
inmates on October 5, 2010. In addition, there was a $4.7 million decrease at the Florida Civil Commitment Center (FCCC) due to the completion of construction in Second Quarter 2009.

 Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our
correctional, detention and mental health and GEO Care facilities and expenses incurred in our Facility Construction & Design segment.  U.S. Corrections & Detention  The increase in operating expenses
for U.S. Corrections & Detention reflects the impact of our acquisition of Cornell which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $63.1 million. We also experienced increases to operating expenses due to the activation of new
management contracts at D. Ray James Correctional Facility and 
  64 


Table of Contents

Blackwater River Correctional Facility. Certain of our other facilities also experienced increases in expenses associated with increases in populations and contract modifications resulting in
additional services. These increases were offset by decreases in expenses of approximately $30 million as a result of terminated contracts at McFarland, Moore Haven, Jefferson County, Graceville, Newton County, South Texas ISF, Bridgeport and
Fort Worth.  GEO Care  Operating expenses increased by $66.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase of $51.7 million in operating expenses related to the acquisition of Cornell. The remaining
increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $16.4 million of operating expenses at the Columbia Regional Care Center in Columbia, South Carolina as a result of our acquisition of Just Care in Fourth Quarter 2009. 
International Services  Expenses increased at all of our international subsidiaries consistent with the revenue increases and are slightly less as a percentage of segment revenues due to a decrease in start up costs in 2010
compared to 2009. The operating expenses associated with the new contracts in the United Kingdom and Australia for the operation of Harmondsworth and Parklea accounted for a combined increase over fiscal year 2009 of $26.6 million since these
facilities were in operation for the entire year in 2010. Changes in foreign currency translation rates contributed an increase in operating expenses of approximately $20.0 million.  Facility Construction & Design  The decrease in operating
expenses for Facility Construction & Design is primarily attributable to the completion of construction at Blackwater River Correctional Facility in October 2010 which resulted in a decrease of $70.3 million, and the completion of our
expansion of FCCC in Second Quarter 2009 which decreased operating expenses by $5.1 million.  Depreciation and Amortization

 U.S. Corrections & Detention 
U.S. Corrections & Detention depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6.4 million as a result of the tangible and
intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of Cornell. In addition, the completion of the Aurora ICE Processing Center and the Northwest Detention Center construction projects in Second Quarter 2010 increased depreciation expense
by $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation on existing facilities related to the depreciation study on our owned correctional facilities conducted in the first fiscal quarter
of 2010. Based on the results of the depreciation study, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our buildings from our historical estimate of 40 years to a revised estimate of 50 years, effective January 4, 2010. For
fiscal year 2010, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $3.7 million. 
  65 


Table of Contents
GEO Care  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for GEO Care in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 is primarily due to our acquisitions of Just Care and Cornell which contributed
increases to depreciation and amortization expense of $0.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively.  International Services
 Overall, depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly in fiscal year 2010 over fiscal year 2009 primarily
due to our new management contracts for the operation of Parklea and the Harmondsworth expansion, as discussed above, and also from changes in the foreign exchange rates.  Other Unallocated Operating Expenses

 General and administrative expenses comprise substantially all of our other unallocated operating
expenses primarily including corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other administrative expenses. These expenses increased significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Increases in general and administrative expenses of $11.3
million are related to the general and administrative expenses of Cornell from August 12, 2010 to January 2, 2011. The remaining increase is primarily the result of acquisition related expenses incurred for both the acquisitions of Cornell
and BI which resulted in nonrecurring charges of approximately $25 million. Excluding the impact of Cornell and the $25 million in acquisition related costs, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2010 would have
been 6.3%. Acquisition related costs consisted primarily of advisory, legal, and bank fees. We also experienced increases related to normal compensation adjustments and professional fees.  Non Operating Income and Expense  Interest Income and Interest

 The majority of our interest income generated in 2010 and 2009 is from the cash balances at our
Australian subsidiary. The increase in the 2010 period over the same in 2009 is mainly attributable to currency exchange rates and to higher average cash balances. 
The increase in interest expense of $12.2 million is primarily attributable to higher outstanding average
borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility which increased interest expense by $6.5 million. In addition, our 7 3/4% Senior Notes, which were issued in October 2009 and were outstanding for the entire fiscal year 2010, resulted in an increase to interest expense of $3.3 million. We also had
less capitalized interest which increased interest expense in 2010 by $0.8 million. Capitalized interest was $4.1 million and $4.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total consolidated indebtedness at January 2, 2011 and
January 3, 2010, excluding non-recourse debt and capital lease liabilities, was $807.8 million and $457.5 million, respectively.  We have interest rate swap agreements with respect to a notional amount of $100.0 million of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes which resulted in a savings in
interest expense of $3.1 million and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively.

 The effective tax rate during 2010 was 40.3%, compared to 40.1% in 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate
increased due to the impact of nondeductible transaction costs, which was partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. In the absence of the transaction costs and the change in the reserve, the
effective tax rate would be 39.4%. The effective tax rate in 2009 included an increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits.

 Equity in earnings of affiliates represent the earnings of SACS in 2010 and 2009 and reflects an overall increase in
earnings in 2010 primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent, contractual increases.  Financial Condition
 BI Acquisition  On February 10, 2011, we completed our previously announced acquisition of BI, a Colorado corporation, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, entered into among GEO, BII Holding, a Delaware corporation,
which owns BI, GEO Acquisition IV, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GEO (Merger Sub), BII Investors IF LP, in its capacity as the stockholders representative, and AEA Investors 2006 Fund L.P. Under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BII Holding, with BII Holding emerging as the surviving corporation of the merger. As a result of the Merger, GEO paid merger consideration of $409.6 million in cash excluding cash
acquired, transaction related expenses and any potential adjustments. Under the Merger Agreement, $12.5 million of the merger consideration was placed in an escrow account for a one-year period to satisfy any applicable indemnification claims
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement by GEO, the Merger Sub or its affiliates. We expect to fully settle the indemnification claims in March 2012. At the time of the BI Acquisition, approximately $78.4 million, including accrued interest
was outstanding under BIs senior term loan and $107.5 million, including accrued interest was outstanding under its senior subordinated note purchase agreement, excluding the unamortized debt discount. All indebtedness of BI under its senior
term loan and senior subordinated note purchase agreement were repaid by BI with a portion of the $409.6 million of merger consideration.  Capital Requirements  Our current cash requirements consist of
amounts needed for working capital, debt service, supply purchases, investments in joint ventures, and capital expenditures related to either the development of new correctional, detention, mental health, residential treatment and re-entry
facilities, or the maintenance of existing facilities. In addition, some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility. Generally, these initial
expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass-through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract. In connection with
GEOAmey, our newly formed joint venture in the United Kingdom, we and our joint venture partner have each provided a line of credit of £12.0 million, or $18.7 million as of January 1, 2012, for GEOAmeys operations. As of
January 1, 2012, $12.9 million was owed to us by GEOAmey under the line of credit. Additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions, other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes.

We are currently developing a number of projects using company financing. We estimate that
these existing capital projects will cost approximately $245.8 million, of which $156.1 million was spent through the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012. We have future committed capital projects for which we estimate our remaining
capital requirements to be approximately $89.7 million, which will be spent in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Capital expenditures related to facility maintenance costs are expected to range between $30.0 million and $35.0 million for
fiscal year 2012. In addition to these current estimated capital requirements for 2012 and 2013, we are currently in the process of bidding on, or evaluating potential bids for the design, construction and management of a number of new projects. In
the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self-finance their construction, our capital requirements in 2012 and/or 2013 could materially increase.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  On August 4, 2010, we entered
into a new Credit Agreement, which we refer to as our Senior Credit Facility by and among GEO, as Borrower, BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent, and the lenders who are, or may from time to time become, a party thereto. On
August 4, 2010, we used proceeds from borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility primarily to repay existing borrowings and accrued interest under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which we refer to as our Prior Senior
Credit Agreement, of $267.7 million and to pay $6.7 million for financing fees related to the Senior Credit Facility. On August 4, 2010, our Prior Senior Credit Agreement was terminated. We accounted for the termination of our
Prior Senior Credit Agreement as an extinguishment of debt. In connection with repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the termination of the Prior Senior Credit Agreement, we wrote-off $7.9 million of associated deferred financing fees in
Third Quarter 2010. On August 12, 2010, in connection with the Cornell Acquisition, we used aggregate proceeds of $290.0 million from the Term Loan A and the Revolver primarily to repay Cornells obligations plus accrued interest
under its revolving line of credit due December 2011 of $67.5 million, to repay its obligations plus accrued interest under the existing 10.75% senior notes due July 2012 of $114.4 million, to pay $14.0 million in transaction
costs and to pay the cash component of the merger consideration of $84.9 million.  On February 8, 2011, we entered
into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Credit Facility, which we refer to as Amendment No. 1. Amendment No. 1, among other things, amended certain definitions and covenants relating to the total leverage ratio and the senior secured
leverage ratios set forth in the Senior Credit Facility. This amendment increased our borrowing capacity under the Revolver by $100.0 million and increased the term loans under the Senior Credit Facility by $150.0 million, specifically
under a new $150.0 million incremental Term Loan A-2. On February 10, 2011, we used the funds from the new $150.0 million incremental Term Loan A-2 along with the net cash proceeds from the offering of the 6.625% Senior Notes to
finance the acquisition of BI.  On May 2, 2011, we executed Amendment No. 2 to the Senior Credit Facility, which we
refer to as Amendment No. 2. As a result of this amendment, relative to our Term Loan B, the Applicable Rate was reduced to 2.75% per annum from 3.25% per annum in the case of Eurodollar loans and to 1.75% per annum from
2.25% per annum in the case of ABR loans and the LIBOR floor was reduced to 1.00% from 1.50%. As of January 1, 2012, the Senior Credit Facility was comprised of: (i) a $150.0 million Term Loan A bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%
and maturing August 4, 2015, (ii) a $150.0 million Term Loan A-2 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% and maturing August 4, 2015, (iii) a $200.0 million Term Loan B, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of
1.00% and maturing August 4, 2016 and (iv) the Revolver of $500.0 million bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% and maturing August 4, 2015.  On July 14, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $100.0 million of our common stock effective through December 31, 2012. The stock
repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow, and borrowings under our Revolver. The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements. The program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and/or vested stock
options. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any specific

amount of our common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at our discretion. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, we purchased 3.9 million shares of our common
stock at a cost of $75.0 million primarily with proceeds from our Revolver.  Our Board determined in February 2012 to adopt a
dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, we anticipate that we will pay quarterly dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of $.10 per share for a total of $.40 per share in annual dividends, subject to capital availability
and periodic determinations by our Board that cash dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration of cash dividends, including our indentures and Senior
Credit Facility. Based on 61.2 million shares outstanding as of January 1, 2012, a quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share would have resulted in a quarterly cash dividend of $6.1 million in the aggregate. Based on our current
capitalization, we do not believe that making dividend payments will materially adversely impact our liquidity. We believe we have the ability to declare quarterly cash dividends, as well as continue to fund the stock repurchase program, our working
capital, our debt service requirements, and our maintenance and growth capital expenditure requirements, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for other corporate purposes.  As of January 1, 2012, we had $140.6 million outstanding under the Term Loan A, $144.4 million outstanding under the Term Loan A-2, $196.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan B, net of $1.5
million discount, and our $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility had $302.0 million outstanding in loans, $58.6 million outstanding in letters of credit and $139.4 million available for borrowings. We also had the ability to borrow $250.0 million
under the accordion feature of our Senior Credit Facility subject to lender demand and market conditions. Our significant debt obligations could have material consequences. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our High Level of
Indebtedness.  We plan to fund all of our capital needs, including our capital expenditures, from cash on hand, cash
from operations, borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility and any other financings which our management and Board of Directors, in their discretion, may consummate. Currently, our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash
flow from operations and borrowings from the $500.0 million Revolver. Our management believes that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our Senior Credit Facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements
for 2012 and 2013 disclosed under Capital Requirements above. We are also in the process of bidding on, or evaluating potential bids for, the design, construction and management of a number of new projects. In the event that we win bids
for these projects and decide to self-finance their construction, our capital requirements in 2012 and/or 2013 could materially increase. In that event, our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the existing Senior Credit
Facility may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs through 2013 and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would
be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms, or at all.  In
the future, our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital-intensive projects will also be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the 7 3/4% Senior Notes, the indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes
and our Senior Credit Facility. A substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and, as a result, on our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital, a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues. While we expect to be in
compliance with our debt covenants, if these constraints were to intensify, our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our compliance with these debt covenants.

Executive Retirement Agreements 
As of January 1, 2012, we had a non-qualified deferred compensation agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, which we refer to as
our CEO. The current agreement provides for a lump sum payment upon retirement, no sooner than age 55. As of January 1, 2012, the CEO had reached age 55 and was eligible to receive the payment upon retirement. If the Companys
CEO had retired as of January 1, 2012, the Company would have had to pay him $5.8 million including a tax gross-up relating to the retirement payment equal to $2.1 million. Based on our current capitalization, we do not believe that making this
payment would materially adversely impact our liquidity.  Senior Credit Facility 
On August 4, 2010, we terminated our Prior Senior Credit Agreement and executed our Senior Credit Facility by and among GEO, as
Borrower, BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent, and the lenders who are, or may from time to time become, a party thereto. On February 8, 2011 and on May 2, 2011, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively, to
the Senior Credit Facility. Indebtedness under the Revolver, the Term Loan A and the Term Loan A-2 bears interest based on the Total Leverage Ratio as of the most recent determination date, as defined, in each of the instances below at the stated

indebtedness, (vi) unsatisfied final judgments over a specified threshold, (vii) material environmental liability claims which have been asserted against us, and (viii) a change in control. All of the obligations under the Senior
Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our present and future tangible and intangible assets and all present and future tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor,
including but not limited to (i) a first-priority pledge of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock owned by us and each guarantor, and (ii) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all of our, and each
guarantors, present and future tangible and intangible assets and the present and future tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility could cause an event of
default under such documents and result in an acceleration of all of our outstanding senior secured indebtedness. We believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Credit Facility as of January 1, 2012. 
6.625% Senior Notes  On February 10, 2011, we completed a private offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021. These senior unsecured notes pay interest
semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2011. We realized net proceeds of $293.3 million at the close of the transaction and used the net proceeds of the offering, together with
borrowings of $150.0 million under the Senior Credit Facility, to finance the BI Acquisition. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. On August 22, 2011, we completed our exchange offer for
the full $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021, and the guarantees thereof, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for a like amount of the outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes. The terms
of the notes exchanged are identical to the notes originally issued in the private offering, except that the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to a registration rights default will not apply to
the registered notes exchanged. We did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer.  The
6.625% Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and are unsecured, senior obligations of GEO and these obligations rank as follows: pari passu with any unsecured, senior indebtedness of GEO and the guarantors, including the 7 3/4% Senior Notes; senior to any future indebtedness of
GEO and the guarantors that is expressly subordinated to the 6.625% Senior Notes and the guarantees; effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of GEO and the guarantors, including indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facility, to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all obligations of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors.  On or after February 15, 2016, we may, at our option, redeem all or part of the 6.625% Senior Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, on the 6.625% Senior Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period
beginning on February 15 of the years indicated below:

Before February 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the 6.625% Senior Notes at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of each note to be redeemed plus a make whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption. In addition, at any time
before February 15, 2014, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 6.625% Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds from specified equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.625% of the principal amount of
each note to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption.  The
indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants, including limitations and restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; make dividend payments or other
restricted payments; create liens; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. As of the date of the indenture, all of our subsidiaries, other than
certain dormant domestic subsidiaries and all foreign subsidiaries in existence on the date of the indenture, were restricted subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with certain of the covenants under the indenture governing the 6.625% Notes could
cause an event of default of any indebtedness and result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. In addition, there is a cross-default provision which becomes enforceable upon failure of payment of indebtedness at final maturity. Our unrestricted
subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture. We believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes as of January 1, 2012. 
7 3/4% Senior Notes  On October 20, 2009, we completed a private offering of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our
7 3/4% senior notes due 2017, which we refer to as
the 7 3/4% Senior Notes. These senior unsecured
notes pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2010. We realized net proceeds of $246.4 million at the close of the transaction, net of the discount on the
notes of $3.6 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the repurchase of all of our
8 1/4% Senior Notes due 2013 and pay down part
of the Revolving Credit Facility under the Prior Senior Credit Agreement. On October 21, 2010, we completed our exchange offer for the full $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017, and the guarantees thereof, which were
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for a like amount of the outstanding 7 3/4% Senior Notes.

 Non-Recourse Debt  South Texas Detention Complex  We have a debt service requirement
related to the development of the South Texas Detention Complex, a 1,904-bed detention complex in Frio County, Texas, acquired in November 2005 from Correctional Services Corporation (CSC). CSC was awarded the contract in February 2004
by the Department of Homeland Security, ICE for development and operation of the detention center. In order to finance the construction of the complex, South Texas Local Development Corporation, referred to as STLDC, was created and issued
$49.5 million in taxable revenue bonds. These bonds mature in February 2016 and have fixed coupon rates between 4.63% and 5.07%. Additionally, we are owed $5.0 million in the form of subordinated notes by STLDC which represents the
principal amount of financing provided to STLDC by CSC for initial development.  We have an operating agreement with STLDC,
the owner of the complex, which provides us with the sole and exclusive right to operate and manage the detention center. The operating agreement and bond indenture require the revenue from the contract with ICE be used to fund the periodic debt
service requirements as they become due. The net revenues, if any, after various expenses such as trustee fees, property taxes and insurance premiums are distributed to us to cover operating expenses and management fees. We are responsible for the
entire operations of the facility including the payment of all operating expenses whether or not there are sufficient revenues. STLDC has no liabilities resulting from its ownership. The bonds have a ten-year term and are non-recourse to us and
STLDC. The bonds are fully insured and the sole source of payment for the bonds is the operating revenues of the center. At the end of the ten-year term of the bonds, title and ownership of the facility transfers from STLDC to us. We have determined
that we are the primary beneficiary of STLDC and consolidate the entity as a result.  On February 1, 2011, STLDC made a
payment from its restricted cash account of $4.8 million for the current portion of our periodic debt service requirement in relation to STLDC operating agreement and bond indenture. As of January 1, 2012, the remaining balance of the debt
service requirement under the STLDC financing agreement is $27.3 million, of which $5.0 million is due within the next twelve months. Also as of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and non-current restricted cash is
$6.2 million and $19.2 million, respectively, as funds held in trust with respect to the STLDC for debt service and other reserves.

Northwest Detention Center 
On June 30, 2003, CSC arranged financing for the construction of a detention center in Tacoma, Washington, known as the Northwest
Detention Center, which was completed and opened for operation in April 2004. We began to operate this facility following our acquisition of CSC in November 2005 (this facility was expanded in 2009 to 1,575 beds from the original 1,030 beds). In
connection with the original financing, CSC formed a special purpose entity, CSC of Tacoma, LLC, of which CSC is the only member, the sole purpose of which is to own, operate, mortgage, lease, finance, refinance and otherwise deal with this
facility. CSC of Tacoma, LLC owns the facility, as well as all of its other assets; we provide detention, transportation and related services for the United States Government from this facility pursuant to a Use Agreement between us and CSC of
Tacoma, LLC. The assets of CSC of Tacoma, LLC are owned by CSC of Tacoma, LLC. They are included in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The assets and liabilities of CSC of Tacoma, LLC
are recognized on the CSC of Tacoma, LLC balance sheet.  In connection with the original financing, CSC of Tacoma, LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC, issued a $57.0 million note payable to the Washington Economic Development Finance Authority, referred to as WEDFA, an instrumentality of the State of Washington, which issued revenue bonds and subsequently loaned the
proceeds of the bond issuance back to CSC for the purposes of constructing the Northwest Detention Center. The proceeds of the loan were disbursed into escrow accounts held in trust to be used to pay the issuance costs for the revenue bonds, to
construct the Northwest Detention Center and to establish debt service and other reserves. The bonds are nonrecourse to us and the loan from WEDFA to CSC is also non-recourse to us. These bonds mature in February 2014 and have fixed coupon rates
between 4.00% and 4.10%. On October 3, 2011, CSC of Tacoma, LLC made a payment from its restricted cash account of $6.1 million for the current portion of its periodic debt service requirement in relation to the WEDFA bond indenture. As of
January 1, 2012, the remaining balance of the debt service requirement relative to the original financing is $19.7 million, of which $6.3 million is classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet. 
On December 9, 2011, WEDFA issued $54.4 million of its Washington Economic Development Finance Authority Taxable Economic
Development Revenue Bonds, series 2011, which we refer to as the 2011 Revenue Bonds. The bonds were rated AA- by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and the scheduled payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by municipal bond
insurance issued by Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. The 2011 Revenue Bonds have an average all-in cost of approximately 6.4%, including debt issuance costs and the bond discount, and maturity dates ranging from October 1, 2014 through
October 1, 2021. The 2011 Revenue Bonds were issued to provide funds to make a loan to CSC of Tacoma, LLC for purposes of reimbursing GEO for costs incurred by us for the 2009 expansion of the Northwest Detention Facility and paying the costs
of issuing the 2011 Revenue Bonds. The payment of principal and interest on the bonds is non-recourse to us. None of the bonds nor CSCs obligations under the loan are obligations of GEO nor are they guaranteed by us. 
As of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and non-current restricted cash is $7.1 million and
$2.2 million, respectively, of funds held in trust with respect to the Northwest Detention Center for debt service and other reserves which had not been released to us as of January 1, 2012. 
Municipal Correctional Finance, L.P.  Municipal Correctional Finance, L.P., which we refer to as MCF, our consolidated variable interest entity, is obligated for the outstanding balance of the 8.47% Revenue Bonds. The bonds bear interest at a
rate of 8.47% per annum and are payable in semi-annual installments of interest and annual installments of principal. All unpaid principal and accrued interest on the bonds is due on the earlier of August 1, 2016 (maturity) or as noted
under the bond documents. The bonds are limited, non-recourse obligations of MCF and are collateralized by the property and equipment, bond reserves, assignment of subleases and substantially all assets related to the facilities owned by MCF. The
bonds are not guaranteed by us or our subsidiaries. As of January 1, 2012, the aggregate principal amount of these bonds was $77.9 million, excluding premium of $8.3 million and net of the current portion of $15.8 million. As of January 2,
2011, the aggregate principal amount of these bonds was $93.7 million, excluding premium of $11.4 million and net of the current portion of $14.6 million.

The 8.47% Revenue Bond indenture provides for the establishment and maintenance by MCF for
the benefit of the trustee under the indenture of a debt service reserve fund. As of January 1, 2012, the debt service reserve fund had a balance of $23.9 million. The debt service reserve fund is available to the trustee to pay debt
service on the 8.47% Revenue Bonds when needed, and to pay final debt service on the 8.47% Revenue Bonds. If MCF is in default in its obligation under the 8.47% Revenue Bonds indenture, the trustee may declare the principal outstanding and accrued
interest immediately due and payable. MCF has the right to cure a default of non-payment obligations. The 8.47% Revenue Bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in certain instances upon casualty or condemnation. The 8.47% Revenue
Bonds may be redeemed at the option of MCF prior to their final scheduled payment dates at par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. MCF maintains separate financial statements and all of the assets to which MCF has title are included
therein. It should be noted that even though we consolidate MCF for accounting purposes, this Variable Interest Entity, referred to as VIE, is a separate entity owned by unrelated third parties. MCFs assets and credit are not available to
satisfy our debts or other obligations.  As of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and investments and
non-current restricted cash and investments is $29.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively, of funds held in trust with respect to MCF for debt service and distributions.  Australia  In connection with the financing and management of one
Australian facility, our wholly owned Australian subsidiary financed the facilitys development and subsequent expansion in 2003 with long-term debt obligations. These obligations are non-recourse to us and total $40.3 million (AUD 39.5
million) and $46.3 million (AUD 45.2 million) at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively. As a condition of the loan, we are required to maintain a restricted cash balance of AUD 5.0 million, which, at January 1,
2012, was $5.1 million. The restricted cash balance is included in the non-current portion of restricted cash and the annual maturities of the long-term portion of the future debt obligation are included in Non-Recourse Debt. The term of the
non-recourse debt is through 2017 and it bears interest at a variable rate quoted by certain Australian banks plus 140 basis points. Any obligations or liabilities of the subsidiary are matched by a similar or corresponding commitment from the
government of the State of Victoria.  Guarantees 
In connection with the creation of SACS, we entered into certain guarantees related to the financing, construction and operation of the
prison. We guaranteed certain obligations of SACS under its debt agreements to its lenders through the issuance of letters of credit for 60.0 million South African Rand. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, we were notified by
SACS lenders that these guarantees were reduced from 60.0 million South African Rand to 34.8 million South African Rand, or $4.3 million. Additionally, SACS was required to fund a Rectification Account for the repayment of certain
costs in the event of contract termination. As such, we had guaranteed the payment of 60% of amounts which may have been payable by SACS into the Rectification Account by providing a standby letter of credit of 8.4 million South African Rand as
security for this guarantee. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, SACS met its obligation for the funding of the Rectification Account and the letter of credit for 8.4 million South African Rand relative this guarantee was not
renewed. In the event SACS is unable to maintain the required funding in the Rectification Account, the guarantee for the shortfall will need to be re-instated. No amounts were drawn against these letters of credit. The remaining guarantee of
34.8 million South African Rand is included as part of the value of our outstanding letters of credit under our Revolver as of January 1, 2012.  We have agreed to provide a loan, if necessary, of up to 20.0 million South African Rand, or $2.5 million, referred to as the Shareholders Loan, to SACS for the purpose of financing
SACS obligations under its contract with the South African government. No amounts have been funded under the Shareholders Loan, and we do not currently anticipate that such funding will be required by SACS in the future. Our obligations
under the 
  75 


Table of Contents

Shareholders Loan expire upon the earlier of full funding or release from SACS of its obligations under its debt agreements. The lenders ability to draw on the Shareholders Loan
is limited to certain circumstances, including termination of the contract.  We have also guaranteed certain obligations of
SACS to the security trustee for SACS lenders. We have secured our guarantee to the security trustee by ceding our rights to claims against SACS in respect of any loans or other finance agreements, and by pledging our shares in SACS. Our
liability under the guarantee is limited to the cession and pledge of shares. The guarantee expires upon expiration of the cession and pledge agreements.  In connection with a design, build, finance and maintenance contract for a facility in Canada, we guaranteed certain potential tax obligations of a trust. The potential estimated exposure of these
obligations is CAD 2.5 million, or $2.4 million as of January 1, 2012, commencing in 2017. We have a liability of $2.0 million and $1.8 million related to this exposure as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011,
respectively. To secure this guarantee, we purchased Canadian dollar denominated securities with maturities matched to the estimated tax obligations in 2017 to 2021. We have recorded an asset and a liability equal to the current fair market value of
those securities on our balance sheet. We do not currently operate or manage this facility.  At January 1, 2012, we also
had eight letters of guarantee outstanding totaling $9.9 million under separate international facilities relating to performance guarantees of our Australian subsidiary.  In connection with the creation of GEOAmey, we, and our joint venture partner, guarantee the availability of working capital in equal proportion to ensure that GEOAmey can comply with current and future
contractual commitments related to the performance of its operations. GEO and the 50% joint venture partner have each extended a £12 million line of credit of which £8.3 million, or $12.9 million based on exchange rates as of
January 1, 2012, was outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Our maximum exposure relative to the joint venture is our note receivable of $13.1 million, including accrued interest of $0.2 million, and future financial support necessary to
guarantee performance under the contract.  Except as discussed above, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
 We are also exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See
Part I  Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  Derivatives 
As of January 1, 2012, we have four interest rate swap agreements (the Agreements) in the aggregate
notional amount of $100.0 million. We have designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the fair value of a designated portion of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes due to changes in underlying
interest rates. These interest rate swaps, which have payment, expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, effectively convert
$100.0 million of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes into
variable rate obligations. Each of the swaps has a termination clause that gives the counterparty the right to terminate the interest rate swaps at fair market value, under certain circumstances. In addition to the termination clause, the Agreements
also have call provisions which specify that the lender can elect to settle the swap for the call option price. Under these interest rate swaps, we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to 7 3/4% per year calculated on the notional
$100.0 million amount, while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a fixed margin of between 4.16% and 4.29%, also calculated on the notional $100.0 million amount. Changes
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings along with related designated changes in the value of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes. Total net gains (loss),
entirely offset by a corresponding increase (decrease) in the fair value of the variable rate portion of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, recognized and recorded in
earnings related to these fair value hedges was $4.1 million, $5.2 million and $(1.9) million in the fiscal periods ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively. As of January 1, 2012 and
January 2, 2011, the fair value of the swap assets was $7.4 million and 
  76 


Table of Contents

$3.3 million, respectively. There was no material ineffectiveness of these interest rate swaps during any of the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 or
January 3, 2010.  Our Australian subsidiary is a party to an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the
variable rate non-recourse debt to 9.7%. We have determined the swap, which has a notional amount of $50.9 million, payment and expiration dates, and call provisions that coincide with the terms of the nonrecourse debt, to be an effective cash flow
hedge. Accordingly, we record the change in the value of the interest rate swap in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. Total unrealized gain (loss), net of tax, recognized in the fiscal years ended January 1,
2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, related to this cash flow hedge was $(1.2) million, $(0.1) million, and $1.2 million, respectively. The total value of the
swap asset as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was $0.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and is recorded as a component of other assets within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There was no ineffectiveness of this
interest rate swap for the fiscal years presented. We do not expect to enter into any transactions during the next twelve months which would result in the reclassification into earnings or losses associated with this swap currently reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

(a)
Due to the uncertainties of future LIBOR rates, the variable interest payments on our Senior Credit Facility and swap agreements were calculated using an average LIBOR
rate of 1.80% based on projected interest rates through fiscal 2019. 


(b)
State income tax payments are reflected net of the federal income tax benefit.  Except as discussed above, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements which would subject us to additional liabilities.

Cash Flow 
Cash and cash equivalents as of January 1, 2012 was $44.8 million, compared to $39.7 million as of
January 2, 2011 and was impacted by the following:  Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $188.9 million, $126.2 million, and $125.3 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2011 was positively impacted by increases in net income
attributable to GEO, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense as well as from cash dividends received from our joint venture in South Africa of $9.9 million. These positive impacts were offset by a
decrease in cash due to timing of cash collections and payments. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2010 was impacted by the effect of certain significant non-cash items such as: positive impacts of depreciation and
amortization expense of $48.1 million and the write-off of deferred financing fees of $7.9 million associated with the termination of our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in Third Quarter 2010. The increase in depreciation and
amortization expense is primarily the result of the additional amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of fixed assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Cornell. These positive impacts were partially offset by the timing
of cash collections and payments. In 2009, cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by an increase in net income attributable to GEO of $7.1 million over the prior year as well as the impact of
certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization expense of $39.3 million and the write-off of deferred financing fees of $6.8 million.  Cash used in investing activities in 2011 of $635.5 million primarily related to our cash consideration of the purchase of BI for $409.6 million and $224.7 million for capital expenditures. Cash used in
investing activities in 2010 of $368.3 million was primarily the result of our acquisition of Cornell in August 2010 for $260.3 million and capital expenditures of $97.1 million compared to cash used in investing activities during
2009 of $185.3 million which primarily consisted of our acquisition of Just Care for $38.4 million and capital expenditures of $149.8 million.  Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 of $454.0 million reflects proceeds from our Senior Credit Facility and 6.625% Senior Notes of $782.2 million and proceeds of $53.2 million from
our 2011 Revenue Bonds, net of discount, offset by payments on indebtedness of $289.8 million. We also made a cash distribution of $4.0 million to the partners of MCF and paid $15.5 million in connection with the issuance of 2011 Revenue Bonds and
the financing of the BI Acquisition. Additionally, we paid $75.0 million in 2011 for purchases of our common stock.  Cash
provided by financing activities in 2010 was $243.7 million and reflects cash proceeds from our Senior Credit Facility consisting of $150.0 million in borrowings under the Term Loan A, $200.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan
B with a total discount of $2.0 million, and of $378.0 million of borrowings under our Revolver. These proceeds were offset by payments of $155.0 million for the repayment of our Prior Term Loan B, payments of $224.0 million on
our Revolver, and payments of $18.5 million on non-recourse debt, term loans and other debt. In addition, we paid $80.0 million for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program and $7.1 million for shares of common
stock which were purchased from certain directors and executives and retired immediately after purchase. 
Cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was $51.9 million and reflects cash proceeds from the issuance of
our 7 3/4% Senior Notes of $250.0 million and
Prior Revolver borrowings of $83.0 million. These proceeds were offset by payments of $150.0 million for repayment of our
8 1/4% Senior Notes, payments of
$99.0 million on our Prior Revolver and payments on non-recourse debt and Prior Term Loan B of $17.8 million. Cash proceeds from our 7 3/4% Senior Notes were primarily used to pay down our 8 1/4% Senior Notes and our Prior Revolver.  Inflation  We believe that inflation, in general, did not have a
material effect on our results of operations during 2011, 2010 and 2009. While some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing, inflation could have a 
  78 


Table of Contents

substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries, which represent our largest expense, increase at a faster rate than the per diem or
fixed rates received by us for our management services.  Outlook 
The following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and, therefore, constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or
implied in the forward-looking statement. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Forward-Looking Statements  Safe Harbor, as well as the other disclosures contained
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements and the
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements.  With state and
federal prison populations growing by approximately 15% since 2000, the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing U.S. detention and correctional needs. The number of State and Federal prisoners housed
in private facilities has increased by 47% since the year 2000 with the Federal government and states such as Arizona, Texas and Florida accounting for a significant portion of the increase. At year-end 2010, 8.0% of the estimated 1.6 million
State and Federal prisoners incarcerated in the United States were held in private facilities, up from 6.3% in 2000. In addition to our strong positions in Federal and State markets in the U.S., we believe we are the only publicly traded
U.S. correctional company with international operations. With the existing operations in South Africa, Australia, and the United Kingdom, we believe that our international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the
private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets.  We intend to pursue a diversified
growth strategy by winning new customers and contracts, expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities. We achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government
agency of a request for proposal, or RFP. We primarily rely on the RFP process for organic growth in our U.S. and international corrections operations as well as in GEO Cares operations. We believe that our long operating history and
reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts. Our success in the RFP process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with
significant revenue potential. In 2011, we activated five new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of 3,533 additional beds. This compares to the three new or expansion projects activated in 2010 representing 4,868 new beds. As of
January 1, 2012, we have two facilities under various stages of development or pending commencement of operations which represent 1,162 beds. In addition to pursuing organic growth through the RFP process, we will from time to time
selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer. We also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of
government- outsourced services that we provide. We will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability. 
The strategic acquisitions of Cornell Companies and B.I. Incorporated have further diversified GEO, creating a stronger company with a
full continuum of care service platform and leading competitive positions in key market segments in the corrections, detention, and rehabilitation treatment services industry. From the development of facilities, to the intake and housing of
offenders, to the provision of transportation functions as well as comprehensive medical, mental health and rehabilitation services, to the reintegration and supervision of offenders in the community, we believe governmental clients are increasingly
looking for full service, turnkey solutions that can deliver enhanced quality and cost savings across a comprehensive continuum of care. Following the completion of the Cornell and BI acquisitions, we are positioned to provide complementary, full
service continuum of care solutions for our numerous government clients.

Revenue 
Domestically, we continue to pursue a number of opportunities in the privatized corrections and detention industry. Overcrowding at
corrections facilities in various states and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities are two of the factors that have contributed to the opportunities for privatization. We expect to compete on procurements at the
state level which represent approximately 18,000 to 20,000 correctional beds. In New Hampshire, the state has issued RFPs for a new correctional facility totaling approximately 1,500 to 1,700 beds. In Arizona, we were competing on a procurement for
5,000 in-state beds. In December 2011, the State of Arizona cancelled the procurement and announced that a new RFP for 2,000 state beds will be issued in 2012. In Florida, the Department of Corrections had issued a request for proposal (RFP) for the
management, under one single contract, of all correctional facilities, reception centers, work camps, and community-based work release centers in South Florida, which total approximately 15,000 to 16,000 beds. The RFP was expected to result in a
contract start date of January 1, 2012; however, in late September 2011, a Florida circuit court stopped the procurement on the basis that the means through which the project was legislated was unconstitutional. In February 2012, the
Florida legislature introduced standalone legislation relative to the procurement; however, the legislation was not approved by the Florida Senate. We believe that Floridas legislative and executive leaders continue to support public-private
partnerships that can result in significant savings for the taxpayers and improved offender rehabilitation. We will continue to monitor this potential opportunity in Florida and we also hope that other opportunities will develop at the state level
over the coming years as states across the country look for ways to maximize savings and improve offender rehabilitation. We continue to be encouraged by opportunities as discussed above; however any positive trends may, to some extent, be adversely
impacted by government budgetary constraints in the future. While only four states have reported new budget gaps and 27 states are on target to meet revenue expectations during their fiscal year 2012, officials in at least 20 states are concerned
with their overall fiscal outlook according to a recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures. As a result of budgetary pressures, state correctional agencies may pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include the
early release of inmates, changes to parole laws and sentencing guidelines, and reductions in per diem rates and/or the scope of services provided by private operators. These potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on
our current operations and/or our ability to pursue new business opportunities. Effective October 1, 2011, the State of California began implementing its Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, which is expected to delegate tens of thousands of low
level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in California. As a result of this decision, we received written notice from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation regarding the cancellation of our agreements for the housing
of low level state offenders at three of our California community corrections facilities. In January 2012, we also received notice from the CDCR of its intention to terminate the contract at Golden State Medium Community Correctional Facility
effective July 1, 2012. We plan to market these facilities for use by local county jurisdictions in California. Additionally, if state budgetary constraints, as discussed above, persist or intensify, our state customers ability to pay us
may be impaired and/or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. We plan to actively bid on any new
projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. Although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook, positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors, including budgetary constraints, unanticipated
contract terminations, contract non-renewals, and/or contract re-bids. Although we have historically had a relatively high contract renewal rate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring management contracts on favorable
terms, or at all. Also, while we are pleased with our track record in re-bid situations, we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations.  Internationally, on September 25, 2011, we assumed the management of the 217-bed Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre located near Glasgow, Scotland. We executed the contract for the management
and operation of this facility with the United Kingdom Border Agency in March 2011. On August 29, 2011, our newly formed joint venture in the United Kingdom, which we refer to as GEOAmey, began providing prison escort and custody services for
the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom under three contracts awarded to GEOAmey in March 2011. Also in the United Kingdom, the government issued a procurement for the private management of nine existing prison facilities which total
approximately 6,000 beds. GEO has gone through the 
  80 


Table of Contents

prequalification process for this procurement and has been invited to compete on these opportunities. We began competition for these opportunities in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expect
contract awards to be announced in fall of 2012. We believe there will be additional opportunities in the United Kingdom such as additional market testing of prisons, electronic monitoring of offenders and community corrections. In South Africa, the
Department of Correctional Services (DCS) had previously issued an RFP to privatize the development and operation of four 3,000-bed prison projects totaling 12,000 beds. Requests for proposal were issued in December 2008. In October
2011, we were notified by the DCS that the procurement was cancelled. We will continue to monitor opportunities in South Africa. In August 2011, our GEO Australia subsidiary submitted a formal proposal in response to the New Zealand
governments request for proposal for a new design, build, finance and management contract for a new correctional center for 960 beds. Our GEO Australia subsidiary had been short-listed in this procurement; however, we have been notified that
our bid is no longer under consideration based on its proposal terms. We are exploring other opportunities in international markets and will continue to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational
risk.  With respect to our mental health, residential treatment, youth services, electronic monitoring services, and re-entry
services business conducted through our GEO Care business segment, we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities. In connection with our merger with Cornell in August 2010 and our acquisition of BI in February 2011, we
have significantly expanded GEO Cares operations by adding 37 facilities, 7 non-residential service centers, and 35 Day Reporting Centers. We also expanded the service offerings of GEO Care by adding electronic monitoring services, community
re-entry and immigration related supervision services. Through both organic growth and acquisitions, and subsequent to our acquisition of BI in February 2011, we have been able to grow GEO Cares business to approximately 6,500 beds and
approximately 70,000 offenders under community supervision. GEO Care assumed management and operation of the new 100-bed Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility in Texas in March 2011. The opening of this facility provides entry into
Texas, which we believe may provide additional growth opportunities. In addition to Texas, several states including Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and others have indicated a desire to privatize one or
more state psychiatric hospitals. Relative to opportunities for community-based re-entry centers, we expect to compete for several formal solicitations from the BOP for re-entry centers across the country and are also working with our existing local
and state correctional clients to leverage new opportunities for both residential facilities as well as non-residential day reporting centers. We continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of
privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area. 
Operating Expenses  Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients. Labor and related costs represented 59.2% of our
operating expenses in 2011. Additional significant operating expenses include food, utilities and inmate medical costs. In 2011, operating expenses totaled 75.7% of our consolidated revenues. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2012
will be impacted by the activation of any new or existing facilities as a result of the cost of transitioning and/ or start-up operations related to a facility opening. During 2012, we will incur carrying costs for facilities that are either
currently vacant or are expected to become vacant in 2012. The carrying costs associated with the approximately 7,700 beds we are currently marketing are expected to be $16.6 million including depreciation expense of $8.1 million. We will also
experience increases, compared to historical amounts, as a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Cornell and BI. In addition to these factors, we expect to experience overall increases in
operating expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of a full year of operations relative to BI, which was acquired in February 2011. As of January 1, 2012, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately
79,400 beds at 115 correctional, detention and residential treatment facilities, including idle facilities and projects under development and also included the provision of monitoring of approximately 70,000 offenders in a community-based
environment on behalf of approximately 900 federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states. See the discussion below regarding Synergies and Cost Savings.

Table of Contents
General and Administrative Expenses 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other
administrative expenses. In 2011, general and administrative expenses totaled 7.1% of our consolidated revenues. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2012 to decrease as a result of an expected decrease in
nonrecurring integration costs related to our acquisitions. In connection with our merger with Cornell, we incurred nonrecurring integration and/ or transaction costs of $2.1 million and approximately $25 million, during fiscal years ended
2011 and 2010, respectively. In connection with our acquisition of BI, we incurred nonrecurring integration and/ or transaction costs of $4.3 million and $7.7 million during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect business
development costs to remain consistent as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business. We
also plan to continue expending resources from time to time on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets. 
Synergies and Cost Savings  Our management anticipates annual synergies of approximately $12-$15 million during the year following the full integration of the merger with Cornell and approximately $3-$5 million during the
year following our acquisition of BI. There may be potential to achieve additional synergies thereafter. We believe any such additional synergies would be achieved primarily from greater operating efficiencies, capturing inherent economies of scale
and leveraging corporate resources. Any synergies achieved should further enhance cash provided by operations and return on invested capital of the combined company.  Forward-Looking Statements  Safe Harbor  This Annual Report on

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to changes in
interest rates with respect to our Senior Credit Facility. Payments under the Senior Credit Facility are indexed to a variable interest rate. Based on borrowings outstanding as of January 1, 2012 under the Senior Credit Facility of
$783.0 million (net of discount of $1.5 million), for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the Senior Credit Facility, our total annual interest expense would increase by $7.8 million. 
As of January 1, 2012, we had four interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of $100.0
million. These interest rate swaps, which have payment, expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, effectively convert
$100.0 million of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes into
variable rate obligations. Under these interest rate swaps, we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to
7 3/4% per year calculated on the notional
$100.0 million amount, while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a fixed margin of between 4.16% and 4.29%, also calculated on the notional $100.0 million amount. For
every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to our aggregate notional $100.0 million of swap agreements relative to the 7 3/4% Senior Notes, our annual interest expense would increase by $1.0 million. 
We have entered into certain interest rate swap arrangements for hedging purposes, fixing the interest rate on our Australian
non-recourse debt to 9.7%. The difference between the floating rate and the swap rate on these instruments is recognized in interest expense within the respective entity. Because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed, a
hypothetical 100 basis point change in the current interest rate would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  Additionally, we invest our cash in a variety of short-term financial instruments to provide a return. These instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date
of purchase of three months or less. While these instruments are subject to interest rate risk, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results
of operations.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the South African Rand and the British
Pound currency exchange rates. Based upon our foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of January 1, 2012 with respect to our international operations, every 10 percent change in historical currency rates would have a $6.2 million
effect on our financial position and a $1.3 million impact on our results of operations over the next fiscal year.

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
To the Shareholders of  The GEO Group, Inc.:
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. They include amounts based on judgments and estimates.  Representation in the consolidated
financial statements and the fairness and integrity of such statements are the responsibility of management. In order to meet managements responsibility, the Company maintains a system of internal controls and procedures and a program of
internal audits designed to provide reasonable assurance that our assets are controlled and safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization and properly recorded, and that accounting records may be
relied upon in the preparation of financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Grant
Thornton LLP, independent registered public accountants, whose appointment by our Audit Committee was ratified by our shareholders. Their report expresses a professional opinion as to whether managements consolidated financial statements
considered in their entirety present fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Companys financial position and results of operations. Their audit was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, independent registered public
accountants, as stated in their report which is included in this Form 10-K.  The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors meets periodically with representatives of management, the independent registered public accountants and our internal auditors to review matters relating to financial reporting, internal accounting controls and auditing. Both the internal
auditors and the independent registered certified public accountants have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss the results of their reviews.  George C. Zoley  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer that: (i) pertains to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (ii) provides reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorization of the Companys management and directors; and (iii) provides reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012. In making its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control  Integrated Framework. 
On February 10, 2011, we acquired BII Holding Corporation, which we refer to as BII Holding, at which time BII Holding became our
subsidiary. We are currently in the process of assessing and integrating BII Holdings internal controls over financial reporting into our financial reporting systems. Managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting at
January 1, 2012, excludes the operations of BII Holding as allowed by SEC guidance related to internal controls of recently acquired entities. Management will include the operations of BII Holding in its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting within one year from the date of acquisition. With the exception of BII Holding Corporation, the Company evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its internal control over
financial reporting as of January 1, 2012, based on the COSO Internal Control  Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, the Companys management concluded that as of January 1, 2012, its internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 Grant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Board of Directors and Shareholders of  The GEO
Group, Inc.  We have audited The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over
financial reporting as of January 1, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. Our audit of, and opinion on, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting does not include internal control over financial reporting of BII Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 15 and 7 percent, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 1, 2012. As indicated in Managements Report, BII Holding Corporation was acquired during 2011 and therefore, managements assertion on the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of BII Holding Corporation.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2012, and
our report dated March 1, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  /s/ Grant Thornton LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Board of Directors and  Shareholders of The GEO
Group, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January 1, 2012. Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), The GEO Group, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated March 1, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/

THE GEO GROUP, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the Fiscal Years
Ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010   


1.
Summary of Business Operations and Significant Accounting Policies 
The GEO Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, and subsidiaries (the Company, or GEO) is a leading
provider of government-outsourced services specializing in the management of correctional, detention, mental health, residential treatment and re-entry facilities, and the provision of community based services and youth services in the United
States, Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Canada. The Company operates a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum, medium and minimum security prisons, immigration detention centers, minimum security
detention centers, mental health, residential treatment and community based re-entry facilities. The Company offers counseling, education and/or treatment to inmates with alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities it manages.
The Company is also a provider of innovative compliance technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants. Additionally, the
Company has an exclusive contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide supervision and reporting services provided under the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), designed to improve
the participation of non-detained aliens in the immigration court system. The Company develops new facilities based on contract awards, using its project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what it believes are
state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency. The Company also provides secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically and in the United Kingdom through its joint venture GEO Amey
PECS Ltd., (GEOAmey).  As of January 1, 2012, the Companys worldwide operations included the management
and/or ownership of approximately 79,400 beds at 115 correctional, detention and residential treatment facilities, including idle facilities and projects under development, and also included the provision of monitoring of approximately 70,000
offenders in a community-based environment on behalf of approximately 900 federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states.  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described
below. 
Fiscal Year  The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the calendar year end. Fiscal year 2011 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2010 included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2009 included
53 weeks. The Company reports the results of its South African equity affiliate, South African Custodial Services Pty. Limited, (SACS), its consolidated South African entity, South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited
(SACM), its joint venture GEOAmey, and the activities of its consolidated special purpose entity, Municipal Correctional Finance, L.P. (MCF) on a calendar year end, due to the availability of information. 
Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the
Companys activities relative to the financing of operating facilities (the Companys variable interest entities are discussed further in Note 1 and Note 3). The equity method of accounting is used for investments in non-controlled
affiliates in which the Companys ownership ranges from 20 to 50 percent, or in instances in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence but not control. The Company reports SACS and its 50% owned joint venture in the
United Kingdom, GEOAmey, under the equity method of 
  93 


Table of Contents

accounting. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent equity that other investors have contributed to MCF and SACM. Non-controlling interests are adjusted for income and losses
allocable to the other shareholders in these entities. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Discontinued Operations 
The termination of any of the Companys management contracts, by expiration or otherwise, may result in the classification of the
operating results of such management contract, net of taxes, as a discontinued operation. When material, the Company reflects such events as discontinued operations so long as the financial results can be clearly identified, the operations and cash
flows are completely eliminated from ongoing operations, and so long as the Company does not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal or termination transaction. The component unit for which
cash flows are considered to be completely eliminated exists at the customer level. Historically, the Company has classified operations as discontinued in the period they are announced as normally all continuing cash flows cease within three to six
months of that date. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Companys significant estimates include reserves for self-insured retention related to general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance, auto liability insurance,
medical malpractice insurance, employer group health insurance, percentage of completion and estimated cost to complete for construction projects, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, stock based compensation and allowance for doubtful
accounts. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While the Company believes that
such estimates are reasonable when considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, the actual amounts of such estimates, when known, will vary from these estimates. If actual results significantly differ from
the Companys estimates, the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. 
During the first quarter of 2010, the Company completed a depreciation study on its owned correctional facilities. In evaluating useful
lives of these assets, the Company considered how long the assets will remain functionally efficient and effective, given competitive factors, economic environment, technological advancements and quality of construction. Based on the results of the
depreciation study, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of certain buildings from its historical estimate of 40 years to a revised estimate of 50 years, effective January 4, 2010. The basis for the change in the useful life
of the Companys owned correctional facilities is due to the expectation that these facilities are capable of being used for a longer period than previously anticipated based on quality of construction and effective building maintenance. The
Company accounted for the change in the useful lives as a change in estimate which was accounted for prospectively beginning January 4, 2010 by depreciating the assets carrying values over their revised remaining useful lives. For fiscal
year 2010, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.7 million, an increase to net income of $2.2 million and an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.04. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include all interest-bearing deposits or investments with original maturities of three months or less. The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located throughout the United States, Australia, South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2012, the Company
had $25.6 million in cash and cash equivalents held by its international subsidiaries.

Table of Contents
Concentration of Credit Risk 
The Company maintains deposits of cash in excess of federally insured limits with certain financial institutions and accordingly, the
Company is subject to credit risk. Other than cash, financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable, a direct finance lease receivable, long-term debt and
financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Companys cash management and investment policies restrict investments to low-risk, highly liquid securities, and the Company performs periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the
financial institutions with which it deals. 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable consists primarily of trade accounts receivable due from federal, state, and local government agencies for operating
and managing correctional facilities, providing youth and community based services, providing mental health and residential treatment services, providing electronic monitoring and supervision services, providing construction and design services and
providing inmate residential and prisoner transportation services. The Company generates receivables with its governmental clients and with other parties in the normal course of business as a result of billing and receiving payment. The Company
regularly reviews outstanding receivables, and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established loss reserves, the Company makes judgments regarding its customers ability to make
required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of these parties change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. The
Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations for some of its customers financial conditions and generally does not require collateral. Generally, the Company receives payment for these services thirty to sixty days in arrears. However,
certain of the Companys accounts receivable are paid by customers after the completion of their program year and therefore can be aged in excess of one year. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such losses
traditionally have been within its expectations. Actual write-offs are charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been unsuccessful. As of January 1, 2012, $1.7 million of the Companys trade receivables were
considered to be long-term and are classified as Other Non-Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets include assets that are expected to be realized within the next fiscal year. Included in the
balance at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 is $22.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively, of federal and state income tax overpayments that were applied against tax payments due in 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
Notes Receivable 
The Company has notes receivable from its former joint venture partner in the United Kingdom related to a subordinated loan extended to
the joint venture partner while an active member of the partnership. The notes bear interest at a rate of 13%, have semi-annual payments due June 15 and December 15 through June 2018. The Company recognizes interest income on its Notes
Receivable as it is earned. The balance outstanding as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was $2.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively. This note receivable is included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets,
current and non-current as applicable.  Note Receivable from Joint Venture 
The GEO Group UK Limited, the Companys subsidiary in the United Kingdom (GEO UK), has extended a non-revolving line of
credit facility to GEOAmey in the principal amount of £12 million. Amounts under the line of credit can be drawn down in multiple advances up to the principal amount and accrue interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company recognizes interest income
on its Notes Receivable as it is earned. The line of credit was executed in May 2011 for the purpose of funding mobilization costs and on-going

start-up and operations of GEOAmey. Principal repayments by GEOAmey under the line of credit are due in March and September, beginning September 2013, with the final payment due no later than
March 30, 2018. As of January 1, 2012, the Company was owed £8.4 million, or $13.1 million, including accrued interest of $0.2 million, under the line of credit and has included this balance with Other Non-Current Assets in the
accompanying balance sheet. 
Restricted Cash and Investments
 The Companys restricted cash and investments are attributable to: (i) amounts held in escrow or in trust in
connection with the 1,904-bed South Texas Detention Complex in Frio County, Texas and the 1,575-bed Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, (ii) certain cash restriction requirements at the Companys wholly owned Australian
subsidiary related to the non-recourse debt and other guarantees, (iii) MCFs bond fund payment account, debt service reserve fund and escrow fund primarily used to segregate rental payments from Cornell Companies, Inc.
(Cornell), the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, to MCF for the purposes of servicing the non-recourse debt and making distributions to equity holders, and (iv) restricted investments related to The GEO Group Inc.
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. The current portion of restricted cash and investments represents the amount expected to be paid within the next twelve months for debt service and amounts that may be paid as distributions to the equity
holders of MCF under the Agreement of Limited Partnership. 
Direct Finance Leases 
The Company accounts for the portion of its contracts with certain governmental agencies that represent capitalized lease payments on
buildings and equipment as investments in direct finance leases. Accordingly, the minimum lease payments to be received over the term of the leases less unearned income are capitalized as the Companys investments in the leases. Unearned income
is recognized as income over the term of the leases using the effective interest method. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 2 to 50 years. Equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used
for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of the
property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the assessment indicates that assets will be
used for a longer or shorter period than previously anticipated, the useful lives of the assets are revised, resulting in a change in estimate. The Company has not made any changes in estimate during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of correctional and detention facilities. Capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over
the assets estimated useful life.  The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long-lived assets,
or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long-lived assets such as the termination of a management contract. If impairment indicators are present, the Company performs a recoverability test to determine whether or not an impairment
loss should be measured. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. For the purposes of the recoverability test, if a
long-lived asset is part of a group that includes other 
  96 


Table of Contents

assets, the unit of accounting for the long-lived asset is its group. Generally, the Company groups its assets by facility for the purposes of considering whether any impairment exists. When
considering the future cash flows of a facility, the Company makes assumptions based on historical experience with its customers, current data related to the pricing of its management contracts, residual value of its facilities, and/or terminal
growth rates. While these estimates do not generally have a material impact on the impairment charges associated with managed-only facilities, the sensitivity increases significantly when considering the impairment on facilities that are either
owned or leased by the Company due to the investment the Company makes in buildings and improvements for owned and leased facilities. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset compared to the carrying value. 
Assets Held for Sale 
The Company records its Assets Held for Sale at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and estimates fair value by using third party
appraisers or other valuation techniques. The Company does not record depreciation for its Assets Held for Sale. Any gain or loss on the sale of its operating assets is included in the operating income of reportable segment to which it relates.

Assets Held under Capital Leases 
Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the
leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease and is included in depreciation expense.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
The Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its business combinations. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the
aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets acquired. The Companys goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or
circumstances arise that indicate impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for all reporting units that contain goodwill. The reporting unit is the same as the operating segment for U.S. Corrections & Detention and is
at a level below the operating segment for GEO Care. The Company has identified its reporting units based on the criteria management uses to make key decisions about the business. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company
elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-08 and as such, when testing goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine
whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the
Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company performs the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit,
using a discounted cash flow method, and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test
to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The qualitative factors used by the Companys management to determine the likelihood that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount include, among other things, a
review of overall economic conditions and their current and future impact on the Companys existing business, the Companys financial performance, industry outlook and market competition. During the year, management monitors the actual
performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during the prior year annual impairment test and updates its annual impairment test, if needed, to determine the likelihood that the goodwill has been impaired. On the
measurement date of October 3, 2011, the first day of the Companys fourth fiscal quarter, management qualitatively reviewed the Companys goodwill for impairment and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair
values of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.

Table of Contents
The Company has also recorded other finite and indefinite lived intangible assets as a
result of business combinations and also in connection with the purchase of additional shares in the Companys consolidated South African joint venture. Other acquired finite and indefinite lived intangible assets are recognized separately if
the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless of the Companys intent to do so. The Companys
intangible assets include facility management contracts, non-compete agreements, BI trade name and technology. The facility management contracts represent customer relationships in the form of management contracts acquired at the time of each
business combination; the non-compete agreements represent the estimated value of contractually restricting certain employees from competing with the Company; the value of BIs trade name represents, among other intangible benefits, name
recognition to its customers and intellectual property rights; and the acquired technology represents BIs innovation with respect to its GPS tracking monitoring, radio frequency monitoring, voice verification monitoring and alcohol compliance
systems. When establishing useful lives, the Company considers the period and the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up; or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a
straight-line amortization method over a period that may be shorter than the ultimate life of such intangible asset. The Company currently amortizes its acquired facility management contracts over periods ranging from three to eighteen years, its
covenants not to compete over one to four years, and its acquired technology over seven years. There is no residual value associated with the Companys finite-lived intangible assets. The Company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company does not amortize its indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company reviews its indefinite lived
intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company records the costs associated with renewal and extension of facility management contracts as expenses in the
period they are incurred. 
Debt Issuance Costs 
Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization of $5.3 million and $1.6 million, totaling $26.6 million and $14.8 million
at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively, are included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt.

 
Variable Interest Entities 
The Company evaluates its joint ventures and other entities in which it has a variable interest (a VIE), generally in the form
of investments, loans, guarantees, or equity in order to determine if it has a controlling financial interest and is required to consolidate the entity as a result. The reporting entity with a variable interest that provides the entity with a
controlling financial interest in the VIE will have both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb
the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  As a result of the acquisition of Cornell in August 2010, the Company assumed the variable interest in MCF of which it is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the entity as a result. MCF was created
in August 2001 as a special limited partnership for the purpose of acquiring, owning, leasing and operating low to medium security adult and juvenile correction and treatment facilities. At its inception, MCF purchased assets representing eleven
facilities from Cornell and leased those assets back to Cornell under a Master Lease Agreement (the Lease). These assets were purchased from Cornell using proceeds from the 8.47% Taxable Revenue Bonds, Series 2001 (8.47%
Revenue Bonds) due 2016, which are limited non-recourse obligations of MCF and collateralized by the bond reserves, assignment of subleases and substantially all assets related to the eleven facilities. Under the terms of the Lease with
Cornell, assumed by the Company, the Company will lease the assets for the remainder 
  98 


Table of Contents

of the 20-year base term, which ends in 2021, and has options at its sole discretion to renew the Lease for up to approximately 25 additional years. MCFs sole source of revenue is from the
Company and as such the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its performance. The Companys risk is generally limited to the rental obligations under the operating leases. This entity is
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. MCF maintains separate financial statements and all of the assets to which MCF has title are included therein. It
should be noted that even though the Company consolidates MCF for accounting purposes, this VIE is a separate entity owned by unrelated third parties. MCFs assets and credit are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of the
Company.  The Company consolidates South Texas Local Development Corporation (STLDC), a VIE. STLDC was created to
finance construction for the development of a 1,904-bed facility in Frio County, Texas. STLDC, the owner of the complex, issued $49.5 million in taxable revenue bonds and has an operating agreement with the Company, which provides the Company
with the sole and exclusive right to operate and manage the detention center. The operating agreement and bond indenture require the revenue from the contract be used to fund the periodic debt service requirements as they become due. The net
revenues, if any, after various expenses such as trustee fees, property taxes and insurance premiums are distributed to the Company to cover operating expenses and management fees. The Company is responsible for the entire operations of the facility
including the payment of all operating expenses whether or not there are sufficient revenues. The bonds have a ten-year term and are non-recourse to the Company. At the end of the ten-year term of the bonds, title and ownership of the facility
transfers from STLDC to the Company. See Note 14.  The Company does not consolidate its 50% owned South African joint
venture in SACS, a VIE. SACS joint venture investors are GEO and Kensani Corrections, Pty. Ltd; each partner owns a 50% share. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of SACS since it does not have the power to direct the
activities of SACS that most significantly impact its performance. As such, this entity is accounted for as an equity affiliate. SACS was established, and subsequently, in 2001, was awarded a 25-year contract to design, finance and build the Kutama
Sinthumule Correctional Centre in Louis Trichardt, South Africa. To fund the construction of the prison, SACS obtained long-term financing from its equity partners and lenders, the repayment of which is fully guaranteed by the South African
government, except in the event of default, in which case the government guarantee is reduced to 80%. The Companys maximum exposure for loss under this contract is limited to its investment in joint venture of $5.6 million at
January 1, 2012 and its guarantees related to SACS discussed in Note 14.  The Company does not consolidate its 50% owned
joint venture in the United Kingdom. In February 2011, The GEO Group Limited, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom (GEO UK), executed a Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with Amey
Community Limited (Amey), GEOAmey and Amey UK PLC (Amey Guarantor) to form a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. GEOAmey was formed by GEO UK and Amey for the purpose of performing prisoner
escort and related custody services in the United Kingdom and Wales. In order to form this private company, GEOAmey issued share capital of £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each and allocated the shares 50/50 to GEO UK and Amey. GEO UK
and Amey each have three directors appointed to the Board of Directors and neither party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of GEOAmey. Both parties provide lines of credit of £12 million
or $18.7 million based on exchange rates as of January 1, 2012, to ensure that GEOAmey can comply with future contractual commitments related to the performance of its operations. As of January 1, 2012, $13.1 million, including accrued
interest of $0.2 million, was owed to the Company by GEOAmey under the line of credit. GEOAmey commenced operations on August 29, 2011. The Company has recorded $2.4 million in losses, net of tax impact, for GEOAmeys operations during the
fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, which is included in Equity in earnings of affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.

Fair Value Measurements 
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company carries certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value, measured on a recurring basis, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
Company also has certain assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in its accompanying balance sheets and discloses the fair value measurements compared to the carrying values as of each balance sheet date. The Companys fair
value measurements are disclosed in Note 11 and Note 12. The Company establishes fair value of its assets and liabilities using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels which distinguish between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Companys assumptions (unobservable inputs). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the respective fair value measurement
falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 inputs are other than
quotable market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities
that reflect managements own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company recognizes transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 as of the actual date of the event or change in
circumstances that cause the transfer. 
Revenue Recognition 
Facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government
appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate. A limited number of the Companys contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain
targets. Revenue based on the performance of certain targets is less than 1% of the Companys consolidated annual revenues. These performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time. Such criteria includes
the Companys ability to achieve certain contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service it provides, non-occurrence of certain disruptive events, effectiveness of its quality control programs and its responsiveness to customer
requirements and concerns. For the limited number of contracts where revenue is based on the performance of certain targets, revenue is either (i) recorded pro rata when revenue is fixed and determinable or (ii) recorded when the specified
time period lapses. In many instances, the Company is a party to more than one contract with a single entity. In these instances, each contract is accounted for separately. The Company has not recorded any revenue that is at risk due to future
performance contingencies.  Construction revenues are recognized from the Companys contracts with certain customers to
perform construction and design services (project development services) for various facilities. In these instances, the Company acts as the primary developer and subcontracts with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors.
These construction revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which the Company determines that such losses and changes are probable. Typically, the Company enters into fixed price contracts and does not perform additional work unless approved
change orders are in place. Costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if the Company believes that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract
price. If the Company believes that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price, costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, and contract revenue is
recognized to the extent of the costs incurred. Revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability,
including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. As the primary contractor, the
Company is exposed to the various risks associated with construction, 
  100



Table of Contents

including the risk of cost overruns. Accordingly, the Company records its construction revenue on a gross basis and includes the related cost of construction activities in Operating Expenses.
 When evaluating multiple element arrangements for certain contracts where the Company provides project development services to its clients in
addition to standard management services, the Company follows revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements. This revenue recognition guidance related to multiple deliverables in an arrangement provides guidance on determining if
separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units, how to allocate amounts received
in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. In instances where the Company provides these project development services and subsequent management services, generally, the arrangement results in no delivered elements at the onset of the
agreement. The elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and management services are performed. Project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract. During the fiscal
year ended January 1, 2012, the Company implemented ASU No. 2009-13 which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements. The amendments, among other things, establish the
selling price of a deliverable, replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method such that consideration can be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method based on GEOs specific
assumptions. BI also periodically sells its monitoring equipment and other services together in multiple-element arrangements. In such cases, the Company allocates revenue on the basis of the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered
elements. The selling price for each of the elements is estimated based on the price the Company charges when the elements are sold on a stand alone basis. 
Lease Revenue 
The Company leases one of its owned facilities to an unrelated third party. The lease has a term of ten years and expires in January 2018
with an option to extend for up to three additional five-year terms. The carrying value of this leased facility as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was $35.2 million and $36.1 million, respectively, net of accumulated
depreciation of $4.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Rental income, included in Revenues, received on this lease for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 was $4.5 million,
$4.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Future minimum rentals on this lease are as follows:

Income Taxes 
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or
liabilities from year to year. Realization of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income and the
character of such taxable income. 
  101



Table of Contents

Additionally, the Company must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. If actual circumstances differ from the Companys
assumptions, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required, which may result in an adverse impact on the results of its operations and its effective tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded related to
deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria. The Company has not made any significant changes to the way it accounts for its deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial
statements. Based on its estimate of future earnings and its favorable earnings history, the Company currently expects full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances. Furthermore, tax positions taken by the
Company may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. In determining the adequacy of our provision (benefit) for income taxes, potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed. As
such, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. 
Reserves for Insurance Losses 
The nature of the Companys business exposes it to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil
rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to
employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal
injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition,
the Companys management contracts generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. The Company maintains a broad program
of insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which the Company carries no insurance. There can be no assurance that the Companys insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all
claims to which it may be exposed. It is the Companys general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into its corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale. 
The Company currently maintains a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $67.0 million per
occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of U.S. Corrections & Detention, GEO Cares community based services, GEO Cares youth services and BI. In addition, GEO Cares residential treatment services division has a
separate claims-made liability insurance program for their mental health facilities with a specific loss limit of $35.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. That same $35.0 million limit also applies to medical professional liability claims
arising out of correctional healthcare services. The Company is uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers compensation, environmental liability
and automobile liability.  For most casualty insurance policies, the Company carries substantial deductibles or self-insured
retentions of $3.0 million per occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In
addition, certain of the Companys facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to
pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest may prevent the Company
from insuring some of its facilities to full replacement value. 
  102



Table of Contents
With respect to operations in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia, the Company
utilizes a combination of locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the Company. In addition to these policies, the Companys Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general
liability policy related to a discontinued contract.  Of the reserves discussed above, the Companys most significant
insurance reserves relate to workers compensation and general liability claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $45.3 million and $40.2 million as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively and are
included in Accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company uses statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods
and assessing their results, the Company considers such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of its facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of its business, among other factors. Such
factors are analyzed for each of the Companys business segments. The Company estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. The Company also may
experience variability between its estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, including its ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as its ability to
accurately estimate the Companys exposure at the onset of a claim. Because the Company has high deductible insurance policies, the amount of its insurance expense is dependent on its ability to control its claims experience. If actual losses
related to insurance claims significantly differ from the Companys estimates, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. 
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in shareholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances
arising from non-shareholder sources. The Companys total comprehensive income is comprised of net income attributable to The GEO Group, Inc., net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign currency translation adjustments that
arise from consolidating foreign operations that do not impact cash flows, net unrealized gains and/ or losses on derivative instruments, and pension liability adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive
Income. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The Companys foreign operations use their local currencies as their functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of the operations
are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date and shareholders equity is translated at historical rates. Income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. The impact of fluctuations in
foreign exchange currency rates for the Companys international subsidiaries is recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also lend and borrow money to and from one another. These loans are measured
initially in the functional currency of the recording entity using the exchange rate in effect on that day. At the balance sheet date, the Company adjusts these balances to reflect the then current exchange rate and records a transaction gain or
loss based on the change in foreign exchange currency rates. 
Derivatives 
The Companys primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes
in interest rates. The Company measures its derivative financial instruments at fair value and records derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. For derivatives that are designed as and qualify as effective cash flow hedges,
the portion of gain or loss on the derivative instrument effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk is
recognized in current earnings as interest income (expense) during the period of the change in fair values. 
  103



Table of Contents
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedge
items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes attributing all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to floating rate liabilities and attributing all
derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to fixed rate liabilities. The Company also assesses whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. Fluctuations in the value of the
derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the hedged item; however, if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge
accounting prospectively for the affected derivative. 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
 The Company recognizes the cost of stock based compensation awards based upon the grant date fair value of those
awards. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of each option awarded. The impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized. 
The fair value of stock-based awards
was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal years ending 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively:

The Company uses historical data to estimate award
exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of the awards represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical data and expected holding periods. For awards
granted as replacement stock options in connection with the Cornell Acquisition in 2010, the risk-free rate is based on the rate for three-month U.S. Treasury Bonds, which is consistent with the expected term of the award. For awards granted in
2011 and 2009, the risk-free rate is based on the rate for five-year U.S. Treasury Bonds, which is consistent with the expected term of the awards. 
Treasury Stock 
We account for repurchases of our common stock using the cost method with common stock held in treasury classified as a reduction of
shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the income from continuing operations attributable to The GEO Group Inc., by the weighted
average number of outstanding shares of common stock. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is similar to that of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator includes dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and
shares of restricted stock. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
The Company implemented the following accounting standards in the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012: 
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2009-13 which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements. As a result of these amendments, multiple deliverable arrangements will be

  104



Table of Contents

separated more frequently than under existing Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The amendments, among other things, establish the selling price of a deliverable,
replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method so that consideration would be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method based on GEOs specific assumptions. This amendment also
significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple element arrangements. This guidance became effective for the Company prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June 15, 2010. The implementation of this standard in the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the BI Acquisition,
the Company also periodically sells its monitoring equipment and other services together in multiple-element arrangements. In such cases, the Company allocates revenue on the basis of the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered
elements. The selling price for each of the elements is estimated based on the price charged by the Company when the elements are sold on a standalone basis. 
Also, in December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29 related to financial
statement disclosures for business combinations entered into after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The amendments in this guidance specify that if a public entity presents comparative
financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period
only. These amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under current guidance for business combinations to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the
business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company acquired BI during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 and has implemented this standard, as applicable, to the related business combination disclosures.
 The implementation of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operation and/or cash flows. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which is intended to
simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the
reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Under the amendments in this update, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the
two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entitys financial statements for the most recent annual or interim
period have not yet been issued. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2011-08 for the purposes of performing its annual goodwill impairment test for its fiscal year ended January 1, 2012. The Companys measurement date for the annual
goodwill test is as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter. The implementation of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
  105



Table of Contents
The following accounting standards will be adopted in future periods: 
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04 which provides a consistent definition of fair value in US GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and ensures that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same (except for minor differences in wording and style). The amendments change certain fair value
measurement principles and enhance the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. The standard will become effective for the Company during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should
be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation and cash flows. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05 which requires an entity to present
all non-owner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive
income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Regardless of whether an entity chooses to present comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements, the entity is required
to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other
comprehensive income are presented. This standard will become effective for the Company in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The Company does not
believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation and cash flows. 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 in order to defer only those changes in Update 2011-05 that relate to
the presentation of reclassification adjustments. No other requirements in ASU 2011-05 were affected by this ASU, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but
consecutive financial statements. ASU 2011-12 is effective for the Company in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will
have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation and cash flows.

Business Combinations 
Acquisition of BII Holding  On February 10, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of B.I. Incorporated (BI), a Colorado corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 21,
2010 (the Merger Agreement), among GEO, BII Holding (BII Holding), a Delaware corporation, which owns BI, GEO Acquisition IV, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GEO (Merger Sub), BII
Investors IF LP, in its capacity as the stockholders representative, and AEA Investors 2006 Fund L.P (the BI Acquisition). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BII Holding, with BII Holding
emerging as the surviving corporation of the merger. As a result of the BI Acquisition, the Company paid merger consideration of $409.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $9.7 million, excluding transaction related expenses and any potential
adjustments, for 100% of BIs outstanding common stock. Under the Merger Agreement, $12.5 million of the merger consideration was placed in an escrow account for a one-year period to satisfy any applicable indemnification claims pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement by GEO, the Merger Sub or its affiliates. The Company expects to fully settle the indemnification claims prior to June 30, 2012. As of January 1, 2012 and as of the date this Annual Report on Form 10K was filed,
the Company was still in arbitration with regards to the amount of the working capital adjustment. At the time of the BI Acquisition, approximately $78.4 million, including accrued interest, was outstanding under BIs senior term loan and
$107.5 million, including accrued interest, was outstanding under its senior subordinated note purchase agreement, excluding the unamortized debt discount. All indebtedness of BI under its senior term loan and senior subordinated note purchase
agreement were repaid by BI with a portion of the $409.6 million of merger

consideration. In connection with the BI Acquisition and included in general and administrative expenses, the Company incurred $4.3 million in nonrecurring acquisition related costs for the
fiscal year ended January 1, 2012. The Company does not believe that any of the goodwill recorded as a result of the BI Acquisition will be deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
The Company is identified as the acquiring company for US GAAP accounting purposes and believes its acquisition of BI provides it
with the ability to offer turn-key solutions to its customers in managing the full lifecycle of an offender from arraignment to reintegration into the community, which the Company refers to as the corrections lifecycle. Under the acquisition method
of accounting, the purchase price for BI was allocated to BIs net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of February 10, 2011, the date of closing and the date that the Company obtained control over BI. In
order to determine the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Company engaged a third party independent valuation specialist. For all other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the recorded fair value was determined
by the Companys management and represents an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. 
The allocation of the purchase price was complete as of February 10, 2012 and any adjustments to goodwill made up to that date have
been recorded in the Companys balance sheet as of January 1, 2012. The final allocation is presented below. During the measurement period, the Company made $11.6 million in aggregate retrospective adjustments to provisional amounts with
respect to the BI Acquisition that were recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts
recognized as of that date. These adjustments relate to the Companys valuation of accounts receivable, property and equipment, intangible assets, other non-current assets, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and other non-current
liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded adjustments to deferred income tax assets, deferred income tax liabilities and other non-current liabilities for tax related matters finalized within the measurement period which
reduced goodwill by $4.6 million. The purchase price allocation as of February 10, 2011 and as of January 1, 2012 and adjustments made to the estimated acquisition date fair values during the measurement period are as follows (in

For fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company has included revenue and earnings,
excluding intercompany transactions, of approximately $113.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in its consolidated statement of income which represents revenue and earnings since February 10, 2011, the date BI was acquired. 
Acquisition of Cornell Companies, Inc.  On August 12, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of Cornell pursuant to a definitive merger agreement entered into on April 18, 2010, and amended on July 22, 2010, among the
Company, GEO Acquisition III, Inc., and Cornell (the Cornell Acquisition). Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Cornell for aggregate consideration of $618.3 million. Of
the goodwill recorded in relation to this acquisition, only $1.5 million of goodwill which resulted from a previous acquisition by Cornell, is deductible for federal income tax purposes; the remainder of goodwill is not deductible. 
The measurement period ended on August 12, 2011. During the measurement period, the Company retrospectively adjusted provisional
amounts with respect to the Cornell acquisition that were recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Those changes are reflected in the table below. The purchase price allocation as of January 2, 2011 and as of January 1, 2012 and adjustments made to the estimated acquisition date
fair values during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):

The Company recognized a reduction of operating expenses of $5.9 million during the year ended January 1,
2012 for items related to Cornell that occurred after the measurement period or purchase price allocation period had ended. These adjustments to operating expenses were the result of a recovery of accounts receivable and an insurance settlement for
property damage at one of Cornells facilities. There were no such amounts recognized in the year ended January 2, 2011.

Shareholders Equity 
Common Stock  Each holder of the Companys common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Companys shareholders. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share equally in all assets available for distribution after payment of all liabilities, subject to the liquidation preference of shares of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. The Company
did not pay any cash dividends on its common stock for fiscal years 2011, 2010 or 2009. Future dividends, if any, will depend, on the Companys future earnings, its capital requirements, its financial condition and on such other factors as the
Board of Directors may take into consideration.  Preferred Stock 
In April 1994, the Companys Board of Directors authorized 30 million shares of blank check preferred stock. The
Board of Directors is authorized to determine the rights and privileges of any future issuance of preferred stock such as voting and dividend rights, liquidation privileges, redemption rights and conversion privileges. 
Rights Agreement  On October 9, 2003, the Company entered into a rights agreement with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent. Under the terms of the rights agreement, each share of the Companys
common stock carries with it one preferred share purchase right. If the rights become exercisable pursuant to the rights agreement, each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a fixed price, subject to adjustment. Until a right is exercised, the holder of the right has no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder as a result of holding the right. The
rights trade automatically with shares of our common stock, and may only be exercised in connection with certain attempts to acquire the Company. The rights are designed to protect the interests of the Company and its shareholders against coercive
acquisition tactics and encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors before attempting an acquisition. The rights may, but are not intended to, deter acquisition proposals that may be in the interests of the Companys
shareholders.

Stock Repurchases  On July 14, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $100.0 million of its common stock effective through December 31, 2012. The stock
repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow, and borrowings under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements. The program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted
stock and/or vested stock options. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any specific amount of its common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at the Companys discretion. During the fiscal year
ended January 1, 2012, the Company purchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $75.0 million primarily purchased with proceeds from the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes it has the ability to
continue to fund the stock repurchase program, its working capital, its debt service requirements, and its maintenance and growth capital expenditure requirements, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for other corporate purposes. 
On February 22, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $80.0 million
of the Companys common stock which was effective through March 31, 2011. The stock repurchase program was implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with
applicable Securities and Exchange Commission

requirements. The program also included repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and/or vested stock options. The stock repurchase program did
not obligate the Company to purchase any specific amount of its common stock and could be suspended or extended at any time at the Companys discretion. During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, the Company completed the program and
purchased 4.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $80.0 million using cash on hand and cash flow from operating activities. Of the aggregate 4.0 million shares repurchased during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011,
1.1 million shares were repurchased from executive officers at an aggregate cost of $22.3 million. Also during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of common stock from certain directors
and executives for an aggregate cost of $7.1 million. These shares were retired by the Company immediately upon repurchase. 
Noncontrolling Interests  Upon acquisition of Cornell in August 2010, the Company assumed MCF as a variable interest entity and allocated a portion of the purchase price to the noncontrolling interest based on the estimated fair
value of MCF as of August 12, 2010. The noncontrolling interest in MCF represents 100% of the equity in MCF which was contributed by its partners at inception in 2001. The Company includes the results of operations and financial position of MCF
in its consolidated financial statements. MCF owns eleven facilities which it leases to the Company. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, a cash distribution was made to the partners of MCF for $4.0 million. 
The Company includes the results of operations and financial position of South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited
(SACM or the joint venture), its majority-owned subsidiary, in its consolidated financial statements. SACM was established in 2001 to operate correctional centers in South Africa. The joint venture currently provides security
and other management services for the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Centre in the Republic of South Africa under a 25-year management contract which commenced in February 2002. The Companys and the second joint venture partners shares
in the profits of the joint venture are 88.75% and 11.25%, respectively. There were no changes in the Companys ownership percentage of the consolidated subsidiary during the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012 or January 2, 2011.
There were no contributions from owners or distributions to owners in the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 or January 2, 2011.

Equity Incentive Plans 
The Company had awards outstanding under four equity compensation plans at January 1, 2012: The Wackenhut
Corrections Corporation 1994 Stock Option Plan (the 1994 Plan); the 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1995 Plan); the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan); and
The GEO Group, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan and, together with the 1994 Plan, the 1995 Plan and the 1999 Plan, the Company Plans).  On August 12, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors adopted and its shareholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to awards under
the 2006 Plan by 2,000,000 shares from 2,400,000 to 4,400,000 shares of common stock. On February 16, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors approved Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 Plan to provide that of the 2,000,000 additional shares
of Common Stock that were authorized to be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2006 Plan, up to 1,083,000 of such shares may be issued in connection with awards, other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, that are settled in
common stock. The 2006 Plan, as amended, specifies that up to 2,166,000 of such total shares pursuant to awards granted under the plan may constitute awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, including shares of restricted
stock. As of January 1, 2012, under the 2006 Plan, the Company had 1,721,504 shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future awards that may be granted under the plan of which up to 944,304 shares were available for the
issuance of awards other than stock options. See Restricted Stock below for further discussion.

Table of Contents
Under the terms of the Company Plans, the vesting period and, in the case of stock options,
the exercise price per share, are determined by the terms of each plan. All stock options that have been granted under the Company Plans are exercisable at the fair market value of the common stock at the date of the grant. Generally, the stock
options vest and become exercisable ratably over a four-year period, beginning immediately on the date of the grant. However, the Board of Directors has exercised its discretion to grant stock options that vest 100% immediately for the Chief
Executive Officer. In addition, stock options granted to non-employee directors under the 1995 Plan became exercisable immediately. All stock options awarded under the Company Plans expire no later than ten years after the date of the grant, except
for the replacement awards issued in connection with the Cornell acquisition discussed above.  The Company recognized
compensation expense related to the Company Plans for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 as follows (in thousands):

 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the
difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal year 2011 and the exercise price, times the number of shares that are in the money) that would have been received by the option holders had all
option holders exercised their options on January 1, 2012. This amount changes based on the fair value of the companys stock.

Restricted Stock
 Shares of restricted stock become unrestricted shares of common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. The cost of
these awards is determined using the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. The shares of restricted stock granted under the 2006 Plan vest in equal 25%
increments on each of the four anniversary dates immediately following the date of grant. A summary of the activity of restricted stock is as follows:

As of January 1, 2012, the Company had $7.7 million of unrecognized compensation
expense that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.  Employee Stock Purchase
Plan  On July 9, 2011, the Company adopted The GEO Group Inc. 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
Plan). The Plan was approved by the Companys Compensation Committee and Board of Directors on May 4, 2011. The purpose of the Plan, which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, as
amended, is to encourage stock ownership through payroll deductions by the employees of GEO and designated subsidiaries of GEO in order to increase their identification with the Companys goals and secure a proprietary interest in its success.
These deductions will be used to purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock at a 5% discount from the then current market price. The Plan is subject to approval by the Companys shareholders on or before June 29, 2012 and, as such,
no shares will be issued until such time as the Plan is approved by the shareholders. If the Plan is approved by the Companys shareholders, the Company will offer up to 500,000 shares of its common stock for sale to eligible employees.

On March 17, 2008, the Company purchased its former Coke County Juvenile Justice Center. In October 2008, the
Company established a formal plan to sell the asset and began active discussions with certain parties interested in purchasing this facility. The Company identified a buyer in 2010 and obtained an update to the buyers letter of intent
effective through July 30, 2012; however, this sale is subject to the buyer obtaining financing and/or government appropriation. If the buyer is unable to obtain the funds necessary to purchase this facility, the Company will need to locate
another buyer. There can be no assurance that the prospective buyer can obtain the financing, no assurance that the Company will be able to locate another buyer in the event that this buyer is not able to obtain the financing and no assurance that
this facility will be sold for its carrying value. This facility is included in the segment assets of U.S. Corrections & Detention and was recorded at its net realizable value of $3.1 million at January 1, 2012 and at

Derivative Financial Instruments 
As of January 1, 2012, the Company had four interest rate swap agreements (the
Agreements) in the aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million. The Company has designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the fair value of a designated portion of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017 (7 3/4% Senior Notes) due to changes in underlying interest rates.
The Agreements, which have payment, expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, effectively convert
$100.0 million of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes into
variable rate obligations. Each of the swaps has a termination clause that gives the counterparty the right to terminate the interest rate swaps at fair market value, under certain circumstances. In addition to the termination clause, the Agreements
also have call provisions which specify that the lender can elect to settle the swap for the call option price. Under the Agreements, the Company receives a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to 7 3/4% per year calculated on the notional
$100.0 million amount, while it makes a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a fixed margin of between 4.16% and 4.29%, also calculated on the notional $100.0 million amount. Changes
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings along with related designated changes in the value of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes. Total net gains (loss),
entirely offset by a corresponding increase (decrease) in the fair value of the variable rate portion of the
7 3/4% Senior Notes, recognized and recorded in
earnings related to these fair value hedges was $4.1 million, $5.2 million and $(1.9) million in the fiscal periods ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively. As of January 1, 2012 and
January 2, 2011, the fair value of the swap assets was $7.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively. There was no material ineffectiveness of these interest rate swaps during the fiscal periods ended January 1,
2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010.  The Companys
Australian subsidiary is a party to an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the variable rate non-recourse debt to 9.7%. The Company has determined the swap, which has a notional amount of $50.9 million, payment and
expiration dates, and call provisions that coincide with the terms of the non-recourse debt, to be an effective cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Company records the change in the value of the interest rate swap in accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes. Total net

unrealized gain (loss) recognized in the periods and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, related to this cash flow hedge was $(1.2) million,
$(0.1) million and $1.2 million for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively. The total value of the swap asset as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was
$0.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and is recorded as a component of other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There was no material ineffectiveness of this interest rate swap for the fiscal periods presented.
The Company does not expect to enter into any transactions during the next twelve months which would result in the reclassification into earnings or losses associated with this swap currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net 
Adjustments to goodwill  During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company retrospectively adjusted a portion of its goodwill with respect to the BI Acquisition. Such adjustments resulted in a net decrease of $11.6
million to the goodwill that was recorded on February 10, 2011, the acquisition date. These adjustments are included below under Acquisitions. Refer to Note 2. 
During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company retrospectively adjusted a portion of its goodwill with respect to the
Cornell Acquisition. Such adjustments resulted in a net decrease of $8.4 million to the goodwill that was recorded as of January 2, 2011. As required by US GAAP, adjustments to provisional goodwill recognized in a business combination must
be presented as if the accounting had been complete at the acquisition date. As such, the Company has revised comparative information for prior periods presented in the financial statements and has included the impact of these adjustments in the
balance as of January 2, 2011 in the table below and on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2011. Refer to Note 2.

Amortization expense was $18.8 million, $5.7 million and $2.0 million for the fiscal years ended
January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively, and primarily related to the U.S. Corrections & Detention and GEO Care segments amortization of intangible assets for acquired management
contracts. As of January 1, 2012, the weighted average period before the next contract renewal or extension for the facility management contracts acquired from BI was approximately 1.1 years and for all of the facility management contracts,
including BI, was approximately 1.3 years. Although the facility management contracts acquired have renewal and extension terms in the near term, the Company has historically maintained these relationships beyond the contractual periods.

The Companys Level 1 investment relates to its rabbi trust established for GEO employee and employer
contributions to The GEO Group Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Although in 2011, a portion of the rabbi trust is considered a Level 2 investment, these contributions are primarily invested in mutual funds for which quoted market
prices in active markets are available. The Companys restricted investment in the rabbi trust is measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The Companys Level 2 financial instruments included in the table above as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 consist of a portion of the companys rabbi trust, an interest rate
swap asset held by our Australian subsidiary, other interest rate swap assets of the Company, an investment in Canadian dollar denominated fixed income securities, a guaranteed investment contract which is a restricted investment related to CSC of
Tacoma LLC and an Investment Repurchase Agreement (Repo Agreement) relative to MCF, the Companys consolidated VIE. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, MCF entered into the Repo Agreement to establish an investment
for its debt service reserve fund and bond fund payment account. The Repo Agreement consists of a guaranteed investment in the principal amount of $23.9 million related to the debt service reserve fund and a second guaranteed investment related to
the bond fund payment account which was $9.9 million as of January 1, 2012. Both of these investments are restricted to eligible investments as defined in 8.47% Revenue Bond indenture (refer to Note 14) and mature on August 1, 2016. As of
January 1, 2012, the Repo Agreement is included above as a Level 2 restricted investment since its fair value is based using market interest rates for similar securities. A portion of the rabbi trust is invested in interest bearing assets, such
as long term bonds, which are valued using market interest rates for similar securities. The Australian subsidiarys interest rate swap asset is valued using a discounted cash flow model based on projected Australian borrowing rates. The
Companys other interest rate swap assets and liabilities are based on pricing models which consider prevailing interest rates, credit risk and similar instruments. All of the Companys interest rate swap derivatives were in the
Companys favor as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011. The Canadian dollar denominated securities, not actively traded, are valued using quoted rates for these and similar securities. The restricted investment in the guaranteed
investment contract is valued using quoted rates for these and similar instruments.

The fair values of the Companys Cash and cash equivalents, and Restricted cash approximate
the carrying values of these assets at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Restricted cash consists of debt service funds used for payments on the Companys non-recourse debt. The
fair values of 7 3/4% Senior Notes, our 6.625%
senior unsecured notes due 2021 (6.625% Senior Notes), and certain non-recourse debt are based on market prices, where available, or similar instruments. The fair value of the non-recourse debt related to the Companys Australian
subsidiary is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on current Australian borrowing rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the non-recourse debt related to MCF is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the
Companys current borrowing rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is based on an estimate of trading value considering the companys borrowing rate, the undrawn spread and similar
market instruments.

Senior Credit Facility  On August 4, 2010, the Company terminated its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Prior Senior Credit Agreement) and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Senior Credit
Facility), by and among GEO, as Borrower, BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent, and the lenders who are, or may from time to time become, a party thereto. On August 4, 2010, the Company borrowed approximately $280.0 million in
aggregate proceeds from the Term Loan B and the Revolver primarily to repay existing borrowings and accrued interest under its Prior Senior Credit Agreement of $267.7 million and also used $6.7 million for financing fees related to the
Senior Credit Facility. The Company received, as cash, the remaining proceeds of $3.2 million. The Company has accounted for the termination of its Prior Senior Credit Agreement as an extinguishment of debt. In connection with repayment of all
outstanding borrowings and the termination of the Prior Senior Credit Agreement, the Company wrote-off $7.9 million of associated deferred financing fees in its third fiscal quarter of 2010. On August 12, 2010, in connection with the
Cornell Acquisition, the Company used aggregate proceeds of $290.0 million from the Term Loan A and the Revolver primarily to repay Cornells obligations plus accrued interest under its revolving line of credit due December 2011 of
$67.5 million, to repay its obligations plus accrued interest under the existing 10.75% senior notes due July 2012 of $114.4 million, to pay $14.0 million in transaction costs and to pay the cash component of the merger
consideration of $84.9 million.  On February 8, 2011, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (Amendment
No. 1), to the Senior Credit Facility. Amendment No. 1, among other things amended certain definitions and covenants relating to the 
  121



Table of Contents

total leverage ratios and the senior secured leverage ratios set forth in the Senior Credit Facility. This amendment increased the Companys borrowing capacity under the Revolver by $100.0
million and increased the term loans, through the issuance of Term Loan A-2, by $150.0 million for an aggregate increase of $250.0 million. On February 10, 2011, incremental borrowings of $150.0 million under the Companys amended Senior
Credit Facility along with proceeds from the Companys $300.0 million offering of the 6.625% Senior Notes were used to finance the acquisition of BI.  On May 2, 2011, the Company executed Amendment No. 2 to its Senior Credit Facility (Amendment No. 2). As a result of this amendment, relative to the Companys Term Loan B,
the Applicable Rate, as defined, was reduced to 2.75% per annum from 3.25% per annum in the case of Eurodollar loans and to 1.75% per annum from 2.25% per annum in the case of ABR loans and the LIBOR floor was reduced to 1.00%
from 1.50%. As of January 1, 2012, the Senior Credit Facility was comprised of: (i) a $150.0 million Term Loan A due August 2015 (Term Loan A), currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% and maturing August 4, 2015,
(ii) a $150.0 million Term Loan A-2 due August 2015 (Term Loan A-2), currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% and maturing August 4, 2015, (iii) a $200.0 million Term Loan B due August 2016 (Term Loan B)
currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% and maturing August 4, 2016, and (iv) a $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility due August 2015 (Revolver) currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus
3.00% and maturing August 4, 2015.  As of January 1, 2012, the Company had $481.0 million in aggregate borrowings

Events of default under the Senior Credit Facility include, but are not limited to, (i) the Companys failure to pay principal
or interest when due, (ii) the Companys material breach of any representations or warranty, (iii) covenant defaults, (iv) liquidation, reorganization or other relief relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, (v) cross default
under certain other material indebtedness, (vi) unsatisfied final judgments over a specified threshold, (vii) material environmental liability claims which have been asserted against the Company, and (viii) a change in control. All of
the obligations under the Senior Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Companys subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the Companys present and future tangible and intangible assets and all present
and future tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor, including but not limited to (i) a first-priority pledge of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock owned by the Company and each guarantor, and (ii) perfected
first-priority security interests in substantially all of the Companys, and each guarantors, present and future tangible and intangible assets and the present and future tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor. The Companys
failure to comply with any of the covenants under its Senior Credit Facility could cause an event of default under such documents and result in an acceleration of all outstanding senior secured indebtedness. The Company believes it was in compliance
with all of the covenants of the Senior Credit Facility as of January 1, 2012.  6.625% Senior Notes
 On February 10, 2011, the Company completed a private offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021. These senior unsecured notes pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2011. The Company realized net proceeds of $293.3 million upon
the closing of the transaction and used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings of $150.0 million under the Senior Credit Facility, to finance the BI Acquisition. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general
corporate purposes. On August 22, 2011, the Company completed its exchange offer for the full $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021, and the guarantees thereof, which were registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, for a like amount of the outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes. The terms of the notes exchanged are identical to the notes originally issued in the private offering, except that the transfer restrictions, registration rights and
additional interest provisions relating to a registration rights default will not apply to the registered notes exchanged. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer.

The 6.625% Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and are
unsecured, senior obligations of the Company and these obligations rank as follows: pari passu with any unsecured, senior indebtedness of the Company and the guarantors, including the 7 3/4% Senior Notes (see below); senior to any future indebtedness of the
Company and the guarantors that is expressly subordinated to the 6.625% Senior Notes and the guarantees; effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of the Company and the guarantors, including indebtedness under its Senior Credit Facility, to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all obligations of the Companys subsidiaries that are not guarantors.  On or after February 15, 2016, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the 6.625% Senior Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, on the 6.625% Senior Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning

indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants, including limitations and restrictions on the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; make dividend payments or other
restricted payments; create liens; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of the Companys assets. As of the date of the indenture, all of the
Companys subsidiaries, other than certain dormant domestic and other subsidiaries and all foreign subsidiaries in existence on the date of the indenture, were restricted subsidiaries. The Companys failure to comply with certain of the
covenants under the indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes could cause an event of default of any indebtedness and result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. In addition, there is a cross-default provision which becomes enforceable upon
failure of payment of indebtedness at final maturity. The Companys unrestricted subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture. The Company believes it was in compliance with all of the covenants of the
indenture governing the 6.625% Senior Notes as of January 1, 2012.  7 3/4% Senior Notes

of the discount on the notes of $3.6 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the repurchase of all of its 8 1/4% Senior Notes due 2013 and pay down part of the Revolving Credit Facility under its Prior Senior Credit Agreement. On October 21, 2010, the Company
completed its exchange offer for the full $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017, and the guarantees thereof, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for a like amount of the outstanding 7 3/4% Senior Notes.

Non-Recourse Debt  South Texas Detention Complex  The Company has a debt service requirement
related to the development of the South Texas Detention Complex, a 1,904-bed detention complex in Frio County, Texas acquired in November 2005 from Correctional Services Corporation (CSC). CSC was awarded the contract in February 2004 by
the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for development and operation of the detention center. In order to finance the construction of the complex, STLDC was created and issued $49.5 million in
taxable revenue bonds. These bonds mature in February 2016 and have fixed coupon rates between 4.63% and 
  125

5.07%. Additionally, the Company is owed $5.0 million in the form of subordinated notes by STLDC which represents the principal amount of financing provided to STLDC by CSC for initial
development.  The Company has an operating agreement with STLDC, the owner of the complex, which provides it with the sole and
exclusive right to operate and manage the detention center. The operating agreement and bond indenture require the revenue from the contract with ICE to be used to fund the periodic debt service requirements as they become due. The net revenues, if
any, after various expenses such as trustee fees, property taxes and insurance premiums are distributed to the Company to cover operating expenses and management fees. The Company is responsible for the entire operation of the facility including the
payment of all operating expenses whether or not there are sufficient revenues. STLDC has no liabilities resulting from its ownership. The bonds have a ten-year term and are non-recourse to the Company and STLDC. The bonds are fully insured and the
sole source of payment for the bonds is the operating revenues of the center. At the end of the ten-year term of the bonds, title and ownership of the facility transfers from STLDC to the Company. The Company has determined that it is the primary
beneficiary of STLDC and consolidates the entity as a result. The carrying value of the facility as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was $26.4 million and $27.0 million, respectively, and is included in property and
equipment in the accompanying balance sheets.  On February 1, 2011, STLDC made a payment from its restricted cash account
of $4.8 million for the current portion of its periodic debt service requirement in relation to the STLDC operating agreement and bond indenture. As of January 1, 2012, the remaining balance of the debt service requirement under the STLDC
financing agreement is $27.3 million, of which $5.0 million is due within the next twelve months. Also, as of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and non-current restricted cash is $6.2 million and
$19.2 million, respectively, of funds held in trust with respect to the STLDC for debt service and other reserves. 
Northwest Detention Center  On June 30, 2003, CSC arranged financing for the construction of a detention center in Tacoma, Washington, referred to as the Northwest Detention Center, which was completed and opened for operation
in April 2004. The Company began to operate this facility following its acquisition of CSC in November 2005 (this facility was expanded by GEO in 2009 to 1,575 beds from the original 1,030 beds). In connection with the original financing, CSC formed
a special purpose entity, CSC of Tacoma, LLC, of which CSC is the only member, the sole purpose of which is to own, operate, mortgage, lease, finance, refinance and otherwise deal with this facility. CSC of Tacoma, LLC owns the facility, as well as
all of its other assets; the Company provides detention, transportation and related services for the United States Government from this facility pursuant to a Use Agreement between the Company and CSC of Tacoma, LLC. The assets of CSC of Tacoma, LLC
are owned by CSC of Tacoma, LLC and are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The assets and liabilities of CSC of Tacoma, LLC are recognized on the CSC of
Tacoma, LLC balance sheet.  In connection with the original financing, CSC of Tacoma, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CSC,
issued a $57.0 million note payable to the Washington Economic Development Finance Authority (WEDFA), an instrumentality of the State of Washington, which issued revenue bonds and subsequently loaned the proceeds of the bond
issuance back to CSC for the purposes of constructing the Northwest Detention Center. The proceeds of the loan were disbursed into escrow accounts held in trust to be used to pay the issuance costs for the revenue bonds, to construct the Northwest
Detention Center and to establish debt service and other reserves. The bonds are non-recourse to the Company and the loan from WEDFA to CSC is non-recourse to the Company. These bonds mature in February 2014 and have fixed coupon rates between 4.00%
and 4.10%. On October 3, 2011, CSC of Tacoma, LLC made a payment from its restricted cash account of $6.1 million for the current portion of its periodic debt service requirement in relation to the WEDFA bond indenture. As of
January 1, 2012, the remaining balance of the debt service requirement relative to the original financing is $19.7 million, of which $6.3 million is classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet. 
  126



Table of Contents
On December 9, 2011, WEDFA issued $54.4 million of its Washington Economic Development
Finance Authority Taxable Economic Development Revenue Bonds, series 2011 (2011 Revenue Bonds). The bonds were rated AA- by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and the scheduled payment of principal and interest is
guaranteed by municipal bond insurance issued by Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. The 2011 Revenue Bonds have an average all-in cost of approximately 6.4%, including debt issuance costs and the bond discount, and maturity dates ranging from
October 1, 2014 through October 1, 2021. The 2011 Revenue Bonds were issued to provide funds to make a loan to CSC of Tacoma, LLC for purposes of reimbursing GEO for costs incurred by GEO for the 2009 expansion of the Northwest Detention
Facility and paying the costs of issuing the 2011 Revenue Bonds. The payment of principal and interest on the bonds is non-recourse to GEO. None of the bonds nor CSCs obligations under the loan are obligations of GEO nor are they guaranteed by
GEO.  As of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and non-current restricted cash is $7.1 million and
$2.2 million, respectively, of funds held in trust with respect to the Northwest Detention Center for debt service and other reserves which had not been released to the Company as of January 1, 2012. 
MCF 
MCF, one of the Companys consolidated variable interest entities, is obligated for the outstanding balance of its 8.47% Revenue
Bonds. These bonds bear interest at a rate of 8.47% per annum and are payable in semi-annual installments of interest and annual installments of principal. All unpaid principal and accrued interest on the bonds is due on the earlier of
August 1, 2016 (maturity) or as noted under the bond documents. The bonds are limited, non-recourse obligations of MCF and are collateralized by the property and equipment, bond reserves, assignment of subleases and substantially all assets
related to the facilities owned by MCF. The bonds are not guaranteed by the Company or its subsidiaries. As of January 1, 2012, the aggregate principal amount of these bonds was $77.9 million, excluding premium of $8.3 million and net of the
current portion of $15.8 million. As of January 2, 2011, the aggregate principal amount of these bonds was $93.7 million, excluding premium of $11.4 million and net of the current portion of $14.6 million. These balances are included as
Non-Recourse Debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The 8.47% Revenue Bond indenture provides for the
establishment and maintenance by MCF for the benefit of the trustee under the indenture of a debt service reserve fund. As of January 1, 2012, the debt service reserve fund has a balance of $23.9 million. The debt service reserve fund is
available to the trustee to pay debt service on the 8.47% Revenue Bonds when needed, and to pay final debt service on the 8.47% Revenue Bonds. If MCF is in default in its obligation under the 8.47% Revenue Bonds indenture, the trustee may declare
the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately due and payable. MCF has the right to cure a default of non-payment obligations. The 8.47% Revenue Bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in certain instances upon casualty
or condemnation. The 8.47% Revenue Bonds may be redeemed at the option of MCF prior to their final scheduled payment dates at par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. 
As of January 1, 2012, included in current restricted cash and investments and non-current restricted cash and investments is
$29.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively, of funds held in trust with respect to MCF for debt service and distributions.  Australia  The Companys wholly-owned Australian subsidiary financed
the development of a facility and subsequent expansion in 2003 with long-term debt obligations. These obligations are non-recourse to the Company and total $40.3 million (AUD 39.5 million) and $46.3 million (AUD 45.2 million) at
January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively. The term of the non-recourse debt is through 2017 and it bears interest at a variable rate quoted by certain Australian banks plus 140 basis points. Any obligations or liabilities of
the subsidiary are matched by a similar or corresponding commitment from the government of the State of Victoria. As a condition of the loan, the Company is required to maintain a restricted cash balance of AUD 5.0 million, which, at
January 1, 2012, was $5.1 million. This amount is included in non-current restricted cash and the annual maturities of the future debt obligation are included in Non-Recourse Debt.

Guarantees  In connection with the creation of SACS, the Company entered into certain guarantees related to the financing, construction and operation of the prison. The Company guaranteed certain obligations of SACS
under its debt agreements to SACS senior lenders through the issuance of letters of credit for 60.0 million South African Rand. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company was notified by SACS lenders that these
guarantees were reduced from 60.0 million South African Rand to 34.8 million South African Rand, or $4.3 million. Additionally, SACS was required to fund a Rectification Account for the repayment of certain costs in the event of contract
termination. As such, the Company had guaranteed the payment of 60% of amounts which may have been payable by SACS into the Rectification Account by providing a standby letter of credit of 8.4 million South African Rand as security for this
guarantee. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, SACS met its obligation for the funding of the Rectification Account and the letter of credit for 8.4 million South African Rand relative to this guarantee was not renewed. In the
event SACS is unable to maintain the required funding in the Rectification Account, the guarantee for the shortfall will need to be re-instated. No amounts were drawn against these letters of credit. The remaining guarantee of 34.8 million
South African Rand is included as part of the value of Companys outstanding letters of credit under its Revolver as of January 1, 2012.  In addition to the above, the Company has also agreed to provide a loan, of up to 20.0 million South African Rand, or $2.5 million, referred to as the Shareholders Loan, to SACS for the purpose
of financing SACS obligations under its contract with the South African government. No amounts have been funded under the Shareholders Loan, and the Company does not currently anticipate that such funding will be required by SACS in the
future. The Companys obligations under the Shareholders Loan expire upon the earlier of full funding or SACSs release from its obligations under its debt agreements. The lenders ability to draw on the Shareholders Loan
is limited to certain circumstances, including termination of the contract.  The Company has also guaranteed certain
obligations of SACS to the security trustee for SACS lenders. The Company secured its guarantee to the security trustee by ceding its rights to claims against SACS in respect of any loans or other finance agreements, and by pledging the
Companys shares in SACS. The Companys liability under the guarantee is limited to the cession and pledge of shares. The guarantee expires upon expiration of the cession and pledge agreements.

In connection with a design, build, finance and maintenance contract for a facility in
Canada, the Company guaranteed certain potential tax obligations of a trust. The potential estimated exposure of these obligations is Canadian Dollar (CAD) 2.5 million, or $2.4 million as of January 1, 2012, commencing in
2017. The Company has a liability of $2.0 million and $1.8 million related to this exposure included in Other Non-Current Liabilities as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively. To secure this guarantee, the Company
purchased Canadian dollar denominated securities with maturities matched to the estimated tax obligations in 2017 to 2021. The Company has recorded an asset equal to the current fair market value of those securities included in Other Non-Current
Assets as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not currently operate or manage this facility.  At January 1, 2012, the Company also had eight letters of guarantee outstanding under separate international facilities relating to performance guarantees of its Australian subsidiary totaling
$9.9 million.  In connection with the creation of GEOAmey, the Company and its joint venture partner guarantee the
availability of working capital in equal proportion to ensure that GEOAmey can comply with current and future contractual commitments related to the performance of its operations. The Company and the 50% joint venture partner have each extended a
£12 million line of credit of which £8.3 million, or $12.9 million based on exchange rates as of January 1, 2012, was outstanding as of January 1, 2012. The Companys maximum exposure relative to the joint venture is its
note receivable of $13.1 million, including accrued interest of $0.2 million, and future financial support necessary to guarantee performance under the contract.  Except as discussed above, the Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

The Companys corporate offices are located in Boca Raton, Florida, under a lease agreement which was amended in
October 2011. The current lease expires in March 2020 and has two 5-year renewal options, which if exercised will result in a maximum term ending March 2030. In addition, the Company leases office space for its regional offices in Charlotte, North
Carolina; San Antonio, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. The Company is also currently leasing office space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Boulder, Colorado. The Company also leases office space in Sydney, Australia, Sandton, South Africa,
and Berkshire, England through its overseas affiliates to support its Australian, South African, and UK operations, respectively. In addition, in connection with its acquisition of BI, the Company is also now leasing 35 ISAP service centers and
eight electronic monitoring field offices. These rental commitments are included in the table above. Certain of these leases contain leasehold improvement incentives, rent holidays, and scheduled rent increases which are included in the
Companys rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis. Minimum rent expense associated with the Companys leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year was $35.9 million, $25.4 million
and $18.7 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Litigation, Claims and Assessments 
On June 22, 2011, a jury verdict for $6.5 million was returned against the Company in a wrongful death action brought by the Personal
Representative of the Estate of Ronald Sites, a former inmate at the Companys Lawton Oklahoma Correctional Facility. On August 22, 2011, the court entered judgment against GEO in the amount of $8.4 million, which includes pre judgment
interest on the amount of the verdict from January 26, 2007, the date of the filing of the lawsuit, through the date of the jury verdict. The lawsuit, Ronald L. Sites, as the administrator of the Estate of Ronald S. Sites, deceased v. The GEO
Group, Inc. was filed on January 28, 2007 in the District Court of Comanche County, State of Oklahoma, Case No. CJ-2007-84. It was alleged that on January 29, 2005, Mr. Sites was harmed by his cellmate as a result of the
Companys negligence. The Company disagrees with the judgment and is pursuing an appeal. A supersedeas bond in the amount of $10.0 million was posted on August 29, 2011 by the insurance company of the State of Pennsylvania. The Company
intends to vigorously defend its rights and believes its accrual relative to this judgment is adequate. Under its insurance plan, the Company is responsible for the first $3.0 million of liability. Aside from this amount, which the Company would pay
directly from general corporate funds, the Company believes it has insurance coverage for this matter.  In June 2004, the
Company received notice of a third-party claim for property damage incurred during 2001 and 2002 at several detention facilities formerly operated by its Australian subsidiary. The claim relates to property damage caused by detainees at the
detention facilities. The notice was given by the Australian governments insurance provider and did not specify the amount of damages being sought. In August 2007, a lawsuit (Commonwealth of Australia v. Australasian Correctional Services PTY,
Limited No. SC 656) was filed against the Company in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory seeking damages of up to approximately AUD 18 million or $18.4 million based on exchange rates as of January 1, 2012, plus interest.
The Company believes that it has several defenses to the allegations underlying the litigation and the amounts sought and intends to vigorously defend its rights with respect to this matter. The Company has established a reserve based on its
estimate of the most probable loss based on the facts and circumstances known to date and the advice of legal counsel in connection with this matter. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on information known
to date and the Companys preliminary review of the claim and related reserve for loss, the Company believes that, if settled unfavorably, this matter could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. The Company is uninsured for any damages or costs that it may incur as a result of this claim, including the expenses of defending the claim.  The Companys South Africa joint venture had been in discussions with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with respect to the deductibility of certain expenses for the tax periods
2002 through 2004. The joint venture operates the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Centre and accepted inmates from the South African Department of Correctional Services in 2002. During 2009, SARS notified the Company that it proposed to disallow
these deductions. The Company appealed these proposed disallowed deductions with SARS and in October 2010 received a favorable Tax Court ruling relative to these deductions, which was subsequently appealed by SARS. On March 9, 2011, SARS filed
a notice that it would appeal the lower courts ruling. The Court of Appeals ruled on November 30, 2011 that the disputed expenses are deductible.  The Company is a participant in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) for the 2011 fiscal year. Under the IRS CAP transactions that meet certain materiality thresholds are reviewed on a
real-time basis shortly after their completion. Additionally, all transactions that are part of certain IRS tier and similar initiatives are audited regardless of their materiality. The program also provides for the audit of transition years that
have not previously been audited. The IRS will be reviewing the Companys 2009 and 2010 years as transition years. 
During the first quarter, following the Companys acquisition of BI, BI received notice from the IRS that it will audit its 2008 tax
year. The audit was completed on October 7, 2011 with no change.  The nature of the Companys business exposes it to
various types of third-party legal claims or litigation against the Company, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees,
medical malpractice claims, 
  130

product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and
wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, indemnification claims by its customers and other third parties, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from
contact with the Companys facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoners escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. Except as otherwise disclosed above,
the Company does not expect the outcome of any pending claims or legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Collective Bargaining Agreements  The Company had approximately 18% of its workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements at January 1, 2012. Collective bargaining agreements with 8% of employees are set to expire in less than
one year.  Contract Terminations  Contracts terminated during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 generated aggregate revenue of $48.8 million and a net operating loss of $2.8 million, which includes $3.7 million of depreciation
expense and also includes transition costs. The following contracts were terminated during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012:  Effective February 28, 2011, the Companys contract for the management of the 424-bed North Texas ISF, located in Fort Worth, Texas, terminated. 
Effective April 30, 2011, the Companys contract for the management of the 970-bed Regional Correctional Center, located in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, terminated.  Effective May 29, 2011, the Companys subsidiary in the United Kingdom no
longer managed the 215-bed Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre in Kidlington, England.  On July 11, 2011, the
Company announced that the State of California decided to implement its Criminal Justice Realignment Plan, which is expected to delegate tens of thousands of low level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in California effective
October 1, 2011. As a result of the implementation of the Realignment Plan, the State of California has decided to discontinue contracts with Community Correctional Facilities which currently house low level state offenders across the state.
The Company received written notice from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation regarding the cancellation of its agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of its facilities: (i) the company-leased
305-bed Leo Chesney Community Correctional Facility which was terminated effective September 30, 2011; (ii) the company-owned 625-bed Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility which was terminated effective October 12,
2011; and (iii) the company-owned 643-bed Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility which terminated effective November 30, 2011. The Company is in the process of actively marketing these facilities to local county agencies in
California. Given that most local county jurisdictions in California are presently operating at or above their correctional capacity, the Company is hopeful that it will be able to market these facilities to local county agencies for the housing of
low level offenders who will be the responsibility of local county jurisdictions. Included in revenue for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 is $26.4 million of revenue related to these terminated contracts. 
On July 31, 2011, the Companys contract for the management of Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center located in Brooklyn, New York
terminated.  On September 2, 2011, the Company initiated discussions with the California Department of
Corrections & Rehabilitation (CDCR) to terminate its management agreement for the operation of the company-owned North Lake Correctional Facility. On September 26, 2011, CDCR notified the Company that its contract would
terminate effective October 2, 2011. Included in revenue for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 is $2.4 million of revenue related to this terminated contract.

In an effort to consolidate existing Youth Services facilities and to maximize overall
utilization, the Company terminated its contracts for the management of Contact Interventions, located in Wauconda, Illinois and the Abraxas Center for Adolescent Females located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the Companys contract
to manage Philadelphia Community-Based Programs located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania terminated June 30, 2011 due to lack of funding.  On October 3, 2011, the Company exercised the termination clause in its contract for the management of the Frio County Detention Center. Effective December 2, 2011, the Company no longer managed
this facility.  The Company is currently marketing approximately 7,700 vacant beds at nine of its idle facilities, including
Golden State Medium Community Correctional Facility, to potential customers. The carrying values of these idle facilities totaled $297.3 million as of January 1, 2012, excluding equipment and other assets that can be easily transferred for use
at other facilities.  Commitments  The Company is currently developing a number of projects using company financing. The Companys management estimates that these existing capital projects will cost approximately $245.8 million,
of which $156.1 million was spent through the end of 2011. The Company estimates the remaining capital requirements related to these capital projects to be approximately $89.7 million, which will be spent through fiscal years 2012 and
2013. Capital expenditures related to facility maintenance costs are expected to range between $30.0 million and $35.0 million for fiscal year 2012. In addition to these current estimated capital requirements for 2012 and 2013, the Company
is currently in the process of bidding on, or evaluating potential bids for the design, construction and management of a number of new projects. In the event that the Company wins bids for these projects and decides to self-finance their
construction, its capital requirements in 2012 and/or 2013 could materially increase.

Benefit Plans 
The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of the Companys executives.
Retirement benefits are based on years of service, employees average compensation for the last five years prior to retirement and social security benefits. Currently, the plans are not funded. The Company purchased and is the beneficiary of
life insurance policies for certain participants enrolled in the plans. There were no significant transactions between the employer or related parties and the plan during the period. 
As of January 1, 2012, the Company had a non-qualified deferred compensation agreement with its Chief Executive Officer
(CEO). The current agreement provides for a lump sum payment upon retirement, no sooner than age 55. As of January 1, 2012, the CEO had reached age 55 and was eligible to receive the payment upon retirement. If the Companys
CEO had retired as of January 1, 2012, the Company would have had to pay him $5.8 million including a tax gross-up relating to the retirement payment equal to $2.1 million. During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, the Company paid a
former executive $4.4 million, including an income tax gross up of $1.6 million, in discounted retirement benefits under the executives non-qualified deferred compensation agreement. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2010, the
Company paid a former executive $3.2 million, including an income tax gross up of $1.2 million, in discounted retirement benefits under the executives non-qualified deferred compensation agreement. As a result of the payments made to these
executives, the Company recognized settlement charges during the fiscal years ended January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The long-term portion of the pension liability as of January 1,
2012 and January 2, 2011 was $16.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively, and is included in Other Non-Current liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

The Company also maintains the GEO Group Inc., Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan), a
non-qualified deferred compensation plan for employees who are ineligible to participate in its qualified 401(k) plan. Eligible employees may defer a fixed percentage of their salary and the Company matches employee contributions up to a certain
amount based on the employees years of service. Payments will be made at retirement age of 65, at termination of employment or earlier depending on the employees elections. Effective December 18, 2009, the Company established a
rabbi trust; the purpose of which is to segregate the assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan from the Companys cash balances. The funds in the rabbi trust are included in Restricted Cash and Investments in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. These funds are not available to the Company for any purpose other than to fund the Deferred Compensation Plan; however, these funds may be available to the Companys creditors in the event the Company becomes insolvent. All
employee and employer contributions relative to the Deferred Compensation Plan are made directly to the rabbi trust. The Company recognized expense related to its contributions of $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million in fiscal
years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total liability, including the current portion, for this plan at January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 was $8.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. The liability, excluding current
portion of $0.6 million and $0.2 million as of January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011, respectively, is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Business Segments and Geographic Information 
Operating and Reporting Segments  The Company conducts its business through four reportable business segments: the U.S. Corrections & Detention segment; the International Services segment; the GEO Care segment; and Facility
Construction & Design segment. The Company has identified these four reportable segments to reflect the current view that the Company operates four distinct business lines, each of which constitutes a material part of its overall business.
The U.S. Corrections & Detention segment primarily encompasses U.S.-based privatized corrections and detention business. The International Services segment primarily consists of privatized corrections and detention operations in South
Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom. The Companys residential treatment services, community-based services, youth services and BI are operating segments aggregated under the GEO Care reporting segment. The GEO Care segment, which conducts
its services in the United States, represents services provided to adult offenders and juveniles for mental health, residential and non-residential treatment, educational and community based programs, pre-release and half-way house programs,
compliance technologies, monitoring services and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers, and pretrial defendants. The Facility Construction & Design segment primarily contracts with
various state, local and federal agencies for the design and construction of facilities for which the Company has management contracts. Generally, the assets and revenues from the Facility Construction & Design segment are offset by a
similar amount of liabilities and expenses. As a result of the acquisition of Cornell, managements review of certain segment financial data was revised with regards to the Bronx Community Re-entry Center and the

  135

Brooklyn Community Re-entry Center. These facilities now report within the GEO Care segment and are no longer included with U.S. Corrections & Detention. Segment disclosures below reflect
these reclassifications for all periods presented and all transactions between segments are eliminated (in thousands).

The increase in revenues for U.S. Corrections & Detention and GEO Care in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to the
acquisition of Cornell in August 2010 which contributed a full year of revenues to these segments of $160.4 million and $158.7 million, respectively, compared to the partial year in fiscal 2010 of $85.5 million and $65.7 million,
respectively. Additionally, in 2011, revenues increased due to the Companys acquisition of BI and the related monitoring services, contributing revenue of $86.9 million, and re-entry services at the Day Reporting Centers, which contributed
revenue of $26.3 million. The Company experienced increases in revenues from International Services in 2011 as a result of positive fluctuations in foreign currency translation as well as from increases in population, increases in the inflationary
index and increases related to the opening of Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre. The Company experienced increases in revenues from International Services in 2010 as a result of positive fluctuations in foreign currency translation as well as from
its new management contracts for the operation of the Parklea Correctional Centre in Sydney, Australia (Parklea) and the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in London, England (Harmondsworth). The Company provided
services under these contracts for the full year in 2010 compared to a partial period during 2009.

In 2011, a significant increase in operating income for the U.S. Corrections & Detention
and GEO Care reporting segments was the result of the Companys acquisition of Cornell in August 2010 which contributed a full year of additional operating income of $39.7 million and $34.5 million, respectively compared to a partial
year of operating income in 2010 of $15.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Additional increases related to GEO Care in 2011, are associated with the Companys acquisition of BI in February 2011.

all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. On a periodic basis, management evaluates and determines the amount of the valuation allowance required and adjusts such valuation allowance accordingly. At fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, the Company
has a valuation allowance of $8.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively related to deferred tax assets for foreign net operating losses, state net operating losses and state tax credits. The valuation allowance increased by
$0.3 million during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012.  The Company provides income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At January 1, 2012, $17.0 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries were
indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. federal income tax rate, additional taxes (net of foreign tax credits) of $2.4 million would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently. 
As of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company had $26.6 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin
to expire in 2022 and $99.7 million of combined net operating loss carryforwards in various states which begin to expire in 2012. The Company has recorded a partial valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the state
operating losses.  Also as of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, the Company had $10.6 million of foreign operating
losses which carry forward indefinitely and $6.9 million of state tax credits which begin to expire in 2012. The Company has recorded a full and partial valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the foreign operating losses
and state tax credits, respectively.

The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards. The exercise of non-qualified stock options which have been granted under the Companys stock option plans give rise to compensation income which is includable in the
taxable income of the applicable employees and deducted by the Company for federal and state income tax purposes. Such compensation income results from increases in the fair market value of the Companys common stock subsequent to the date of
grant. At fiscal year end 2011, the deferred tax asset net of a valuation allowance related to unexercised stock options and restricted stock grants for which the company has recorded a book expense was $3.8 million. 
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would
more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized
tax benefits is as follows:

All amounts in the reconciliation are reported on a gross basis and do not reflect a federal tax benefit on state
income taxes. The Company has accrued $5.1 million of accrued uncertain tax benefits as of January 1, 2012 which is inclusive of the federal tax benefit on state income taxes. The Company anticipates a decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits
within 12 months of the reporting date of approximately $0.6 million. Settlements reported in the reconciliation for 2011 include amounts related to federal audit adjustments for the years 2002 through 2005, for which a settlement was
finalized in 2011. The accrued uncertain tax balance at January 1, 2012 includes $5.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if ultimately recognized, will reduce the Companys annual effective tax rate. 
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax
regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2009. The company participates in the voluntary IRS real-time tax audit Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) beginning in 2011. The 2009 and 2010 years are under
audit as transition years as provided under the IRS CAP program.  During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, the IRS completed
its examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2005. Following the examination, the IRS notified the Company that it proposed to disallow a deduction that the Company realized during the 2005
tax year. The Company appealed this proposed disallowed deduction with the IRSs appeals division. In December 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the office of IRS Appeals on the amount of the deduction which is currently being

reviewed at a higher level. The Company previously reported that if the disallowed deduction were to be sustained on appeal, it could result in a potential tax exposure to the Company of up to
$15.4 million. In the second quarter 2011, the matter was resolved with no change.  The calculation of the Companys
provision (benefit) for income taxes requires the use of significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In determining the adequacy of the Companys provision (benefit) for
income taxes, potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed. As such, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these
issues, cannot be estimated with certainty.  During the fiscal years ended January 1, 2012, January 2, 2011 and
January 3, 2010, the Company recognized $0.0 million, $(0.8) million and $0.1 million in interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had accrued $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the payment of interest and penalties at
January 1, 2012, and January 2, 2011, respectively. The Company classifies interest and penalties as interest expense and other expense, respectively.

 Revenues increased in First, Second and Third Quarters of 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the Companys acquisitions of Cornell and
BI in August 2010 and February 2011, respectively. The most significant increase in revenue occurred in Second Quarter 2011 which was the result of the BI acquisition. The Company also activated several projects in 2010 and 2011 which contributed to
the increase in revenues in 2011. These activations include: D. Ray James Correctional Facility and Blackwater River Correctional Facility which were both activated in October 2010, Indiana Short Term Offender Program which began operations in March
2011, Adelanto Processing Center East which began operations in August 2011. Revenues for U.S. Corrections & Detention during Third and Fourth Quarters were negatively impacted by

our terminated contracts in California. Revenues for International Services during Third and Fourth Quarters 2011 were negatively impacted by the terminated contract for the operation of
Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre offset by the opening of Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre and positive foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 


(2)
Operating income in First Quarter 2011 includes aggregate costs of approximately $9.2 million for transaction related expenses associated with the Companys
acquisitions; start-up costs associated with North Lake, Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility and Indiana Short Term Offender Program; and transition costs related to the termination of certain of its management contracts. The Company
did not have any material costs associated with acquisitions, project activations or contract terminations in 2010. During Second Quarter 2011, the Company incurred $5.6 million in start-up costs primarily related to the activation of North
Lake compared to costs in Second Quarter 2010 associated with the acquisition of Cornell of $2.1 million. Operating income in Third Quarter 2011 was significantly higher than operating income in Third Quarter 2010 due to acquisition related costs
incurred in Third Quarter 2010 of approximately $13.5 million that did not reoccur in 2011. In Fourth Quarter 2011, the Company incurred startup costs of approximately $7.1 million primarily related to the activation of Riverbend Correctional
Facility and the Companys joint venture in the United Kingdom compared to costs in Fourth Quarter 2010 of $9.7 million associated with the Cornell Acquisition. 
 


(3)
In addition to the factors discussed in notes (1) and (2) above, net income in Fourth Quarter 2011 was negatively impacted by interest expense which was
higher due to the greater outstanding borrowings under the Companys Senior Credit Facility and also due to the 6.625% Senior Notes which were issued in February 2011. Additionally, the Companys net income in Fourth Quarter was negatively
impacted by the Companys loss related to GEOAmey, which commenced operations in August 2011. The negative impact of GEOAmey and the increase in outstanding borrowings was partially offset by an increase in operating income for Fourth Quarter
2011.

Subsequent events 
On August 12, 2010, the Company acquired the Baker Community Correctional Facility in connection with the Cornell
Acquisition. This facility, an asset of the U.S. Corrections & Detention reportable segment, was classified as an Asset Held For Sale as of January 1, 2012, had a carrying value of $0.4 million and was sold in January 2012 for
$0.4 million, net of selling costs.  The Companys Board of Directors determined in February 2012 to adopt a
dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, the Company anticipates it will pay quarterly dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of $.10 per share for a total of $.40 per share in annual dividends, subject to capital
availability and periodic determinations by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of its shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and the Companys agreements applicable to the declaration of cash
dividends, including the Companys indentures and Senior Credit Facility.  Contracts terminated after January 1,
2012 generated aggregate revenue during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 of $14.4 million and a pre tax operating profit of $4.7 million, which includes $0.8 million of depreciation expense. The following contracts terminated after
January 1, 2012:  On or about January 31, 2012, the Company was formally notified by the California Department of
Corrections of their intention to exercise the right to terminate the Companys contract for the management of the Golden State Medium Community Correctional Facility. Effective July 1, 2012, the Company will no longer manage this facility.
 In February 2012, the Company was notified that its contract for the management of the Migrant Operations Center in
Guantanamo Bay NAS, Cuba would terminate effective March 31, 2012.

Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
As discussed in Note 14, the Company completed a private offering of $300.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (such 6.625% Senior Notes collectively with the
7 3/4% Senior Notes issued October 20,
2009, the Notes). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors). BII Holding
has been classified in the Condensed Consolidating Financial Information as a guarantor to the Companys Notes. On February 10, 2011, the 6.625% Senior Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and outside the United States only to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. In connection with the sale of the 6.625% Senior
Notes, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers of the 6.625% Senior Notes party thereto, pursuant to which the Company and its Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) agreed to file a registration
statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 6.625% Senior Notes for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act. The Company filed a registration statement with respect to this offer to exchange the 6.625%
Senior Notes which became effective on July 22, 2011.  The following condensed consolidating financial
information, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for presentation of Rule 3-10(d) of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, presents the condensed consolidating financial information separately for:
 (i) The GEO Group, Inc., as the issuer of the Notes; 
(ii) The Subsidiary Guarantors, on a combined basis, which are 100% owned by The Geo Group, Inc., and which are
guarantors of the Notes;  (iii) The Companys other subsidiaries, on a combined basis, which are not
guarantors of the Notes (the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors);  (iv) Consolidating entries and
eliminations representing adjustments to: (a) eliminate intercompany transactions between or among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors and (b) eliminate the investments in the Companys
subsidiaries; and  (v) The Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None.   


Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, referred to as the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. On the basis of this review, our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that
the information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  On February 10, 2011, we acquired BII Holding, at which time BII Holding
and its subsidiaries became our subsidiaries. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report for further details of the transaction. We are currently in the process of assessing and integrating BII Holdings
internal controls over financial reporting into our financial reporting systems. Managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting at January 1, 2012, excludes the operations of BII Holding as allowed by SEC guidance related
to internal controls of recently acquired entities. Management will include the operations of BII Holding in its assessment of internal control over financial reporting within one year from the date of acquisition. 
It should be noted that the effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations inherent
in any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to
eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. As a result, by its nature, our system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only
reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives.  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
(a) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
See Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplemental Data  Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting for managements report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012.  (b) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 
See Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplemental Data  Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm for the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012. 
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for reporting any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such terms is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over

financial reporting. Management believes that there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
